Ah where to begin, Ive been doing drugs for about 5-6 years now, and about 1 1/2 years ago I started doing opiates (oxycontin, hydromorphone, and other opiates).  Then I went to treatment for about 10 months, only to come back to the same comforting feeling of opiates.  Only this time I upgraded to heroin.

So I've been doing heroin (snorted, occasionally IV) and oxy's sometimes, daily (up to 1-2 grams/ day) for the last 6 months, then because I couldnt afford my habit and I was tired of the withdrawals, I went and got Suboxone from a local drug clinic.

For the first week it was great, I felt good, I saved money, and didnt use dope.  However, a week in I started using the shit again.  And since then I have stopped for more than a week at a time.

I actually find myself very addicted to the Suboxone now, I actually made my mom drive to fill my prescription in between my grandmas funeral and burial and in turn made us late.  Also, I havent stop using heroin, but my daily use had ended and I only use about once a week, and I dont even get high.</bodytext></report>
