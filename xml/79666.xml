Fibromyalgia is ameliorated by different medications in different people. For me, the 'magic pill' is Ambien.

I don't get high on Ambien, nor does it 'make' me go to sleep. I take it about twenty minutes before I want to lie down, and spend that twenty minutes doing my usual pre-sleep routine. When I begin to go to sleep, I see normal hypnagogic shapes and colors, and slide right down into normal sleep. I can be awakened from it (though I am not very gracious) and wake normally after eight to nine hours with no hangover. I apparently talk in my sleep on it, but having talked in my sleep from childhood, this is nothing new.

Ambien makes the difference between being able to function the next day and being so tired and sore that I can't think straight.</bodytext></report>
