The most desirable psychological effects from the lotus are empathogenic and stimulating (barring sleepiness). Unlike the effect of an opiod, which is an overt secure affection to varying intensities and layers, Blue Lotus can inspire a gemlike happy, joyful, very alive quality of unattached affectivity - but oddly this only seems to occur when I engage these emotions fully, they are suddenly then intensified.</bodytext></report>
