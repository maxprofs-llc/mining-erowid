I would like to take the time to share some of the effects of medical grade nitrous oxide when abused, I used to be employed in a hospital, and via experiments with friends, usually on the night shift, became 'dependent' on nitrous oxide, to the extent where I was asked to leave my employment before disciplinary action was taken against me for dereliction of duty. I think that this extraordinary substance is hugely important, much misunderstood, and extremely habit forming to some individuals.

The experience would begin with a sensation of a veil dropping down over my eyes, and as the anaesthesia deepened, I would sense entities around me, that  I would describe as 'elemental', mischievous Pan-like beings that surround the gas outlet point as the faeries of old surround ancient brooks and springs (I know this sounds insane but that is exactly what it seemed like) once I was in their presence, and provided I could maintain a steady dose rate, (I achieved this with a non rebreathe anaesthesia mask and I litre rebreathe bag) I would gradually sink into another world which is completely real, but disturbing. A distant throbbing was to be heard (probably my own heart) and I would often see large armies if oriental beings rushing hither and yon, right past me, often I would apparently spontaneously 'jump' into situations where I was a remote viewer. By occasions I was intimately observing a dispute and killing of a young west indian male at what appeared to be a south London taxi rank, on another occasion I was in a smack den in a Glasgow flat (oddly I was 'seen' on this occasion by a deeply stoned scot who did not seem pleased to see me...).

I have used acid and mushies in the past and this was NOTHING like those experiences, this was real, I would also apparently jump back in time, on one occasion finding myself on the site of the building I was in during its construction... Or perhaps at its subsequent demolition some time later, with hard hatted workers and heavy plant all around me.

As I continued to abuse nitrous I began to attempt to control the experience which is almost impossible, although by focusing extremely carefully I once was able to remotely view some colleagues in another part of the department having a discussion of a personal nature, which to their horror I was able to relay to them subsequently, to the extent that they accused me of having been hiding in the room with them. This episode was peculiar in that I remember floating along the ceiling and observing them as if through a long tube, it was extremely difficult to remain focused.

Anyway, I am convinced that this substance is the key to either our deepest thoughts, or to another reality which exists alongside our own, but it is not such a nice place, in fact now some five years since I last imbibed I dont think Ive shaken off all the 'beings' I met in there. So guys, beware, but in the spirit of the true pschonaut, explore.</bodytext></report>
