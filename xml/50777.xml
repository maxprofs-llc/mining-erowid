I have noticed, over the past few years, that one twenty-five milligram dose of Seroquel (Quetiapine) can completely end any psychedelic trip. That can be if I am having a bad trip, or simply want to sleep and cannot. Seroquel appears to have some sort of dopaminergic/serotinergic blocking abilities, as it slowly but surely will diminish most of the effects of whatever I've taken, until all I can feel is the sedative effects of the pill. It is an antipsychotic, and while it's much more safe than Risperidone and other more old-fashioned antipsychotics in terms of long-term effects, I limit use of it to when it's absolutely necessary. It WILL make me sleep, that is pretty much guaranteed.</bodytext></report>
