This drug should seriously be illegal.  I have been on 350 mg a day for almost 5 years and if I even THINK about not taking them I go through withdrawal symptoms.  I get that electric shock/crazy ass dizzy feeling, nausea and vommiting, a cold sweat, and I start to black out and eventually pass out.  And that's just after not taking it for 2 days.  Yes TWO days.  Without health insurance I would be paying 500 dollars every 3 months to stay on it.  I am TERRIFIED of getting off.  The depression comes back, full speed, much worse than I've had before and I feel like I'm losing my mind if I forget to take it.  It also makes me constantly exhausted.  I feel like I could sleep for days on end.  I'm going to the doctor to get off of this, but I'm afraid of what I will experience in the process.

I was never told that this was addictive.  I was given it back when it was new, so I feel like I was used as a puppet, to try this out.  Being on 350 mg a day is craziness.  I know that it is killing my liver as I sit here and write this.  Even if I were to take 150 mg or a little more, I go through the same amount of withdrawal symptoms. and if I am even an hour late on taking my meds, I start to feel like crap. This is a horrible drug!  I dont understand why it is even on the market today.  For me, it has caused more harm than good.</bodytext></report>
