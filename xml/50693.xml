I took orally approximately one sixth of a 100 mg. bag of 5-meo-amt. After about a half an hour, I felt nauseous. Soon after, I vomited. I absolutely could not stop feeling extremely nauseous, no matter how much I vomited. This uncontrollable nausea which lasted for about fourteen hours made me fearful of dying. I saw glowing and sharp, pointy, ugly hallucinatory patterns. Instead of feeling good and enlightened and in a mind-expanded trip, I felt like I was in a dull, boring, retarded, repetetive trip.

I was not able to eat for the first 10 or 12 hours because I constantly felt nauseous. Instead of a taste of insanity, I got a taste of being RETARDED. This is the worst chemical ever created. I would love to kick whoever invented it in the face.  The worst part of this is the fact that I have lost the ability to trip on genuine acid. My body must recognize every psychedelic drug now as a research chemical which needs to be rejected. Thus, my acid trips have been basically out of focus and dissatisfying. I hope some day I will gain the ability to trip on acid again.

I regret taking this chemical.  There has also been basically no professional or legitimate research performed with these chemicals. Thus, who can help me be able to trip on acid again? No one. Research chemicals are SHIT.</bodytext></report>
