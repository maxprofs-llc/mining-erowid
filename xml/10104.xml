I've been brewing homemade mead for about a month now. Seems harmless right? Just mix, heat, and let it sit for a month under a bed next to a heater..... A word of caution- Release the pressure in the bottles every day! 3-lieters of fermented honey exploding under your bed like a rocket is very hard to explain to parents! (don't ask how I explained it to mine!) I'm still brewing, but using caution!</bodytext></report>
