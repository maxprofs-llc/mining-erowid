I will never again, not under any circumstance mix psilocybin containing mushrooms with DPT.  The results were devastating and unbelievably adverse.  After 2 hours of ingesting the mushrooms i insufflated a relatively moderate dose of DPT.  As its effects began to manifest, i knew i had done something terribly wrong.  Within minutes i was cornered like a very frightened animal, wanting it to all go away.  It felt like there was lava in my bloodstream, i became frantic and desperately wanted it out of me.

DPT undeniably has some type of odd effect on my cardiovascular system, my heart beat became, for lack of a better word, 'unregulated.' The insight I am able to gain from each of these substances independently was nowhere to be seen.  There was only sheer terror, the likes of which i have never encountered.  I wanted it to end so desperately, i took a large quantity of melatonin and some xanax, which knocked me out as intended.

I'm not one to run from problems, but it was horrifyingly frightening i wanted to die in my sleep not excruciating agony.  By God's will i awoke the next morning, sore, and surprised/grateful to be alive.

Lesson learned. This was a wake up call for me.</bodytext></report>
