I was working on my computer one day and was using a bottle of duster to clean it out.  Since I was fimiliar to it, and have done small doses once or twice before, I decided to take some hits.  I shook up the bottle, sprayed a little, to get the liquid out of the spray, and put the tube in my mouth, leaving my mouth open to get oxygen in, and held the trigger down.  I do this for about three hits, then I close my mouth on the tube, and slowly suck the duster in, then in the middle, open my mouth and allow for a mixture of duster and air to enter.  I do that, increasing the amount of duster-only breaths.  I am hit hard with it.  The whole ordeal lasted about 10 to 15 mins.  I am sitting on my bed, just thinking about things.  Got a loud ringing in my ears.  I drift between things I think about, and reality.  I think about past things that have happened, and bam, hit by reality.  I start thinking that our life is a cruel joke, and we are the ants in the glass (ant farms), like the kind most of us got when we were kids.  I somehow figured it out!  I had to crack this joke.

I then see the universe, waiting for something to happen, then in my head, something is going to happen.  Then bam!  There is a loud boom.  Suddenly, the universe and my life is shattered.  I don't remember what happens next, but the one thing I do know, the duster made me realize this life is a joke, and that when we die, we come back here in another human form to live another life, without us knowing that we have lived past lifes.</bodytext></report>
