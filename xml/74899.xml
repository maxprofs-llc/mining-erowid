General Facts:
/n
I'll note that the only thing I am prescribe of this concoction is Lexapro which I got on a little over a year ago after spending several years on St. John's Wort &amp; other remedies for a diagnosis of PTSD &amp; moderate depression.
/n
/n
I'm familiar with many substances from E to Acid to AMT to Shrooms &amp; Herb.  Years since I've been into that or any hard stuff. I'm more interested now in nootropics (smart drugs) for day to day life enhancement.

So my pops was away for a day to attend a seminar on Huntington's Disease (if any of you are familiar, it explains my interest in nootropics) so I decided to take a day concocting a mix of supplies I had on hand.

Experience:
/n
8:00 am - 200mg Modafinil
/n
Modafinil is a fantastic substance almost a dream drug but one of the few downsides is that its effects taper with long term usage.  If used daily for a month its only about half as effective.  But this was a recent acquisition for me and I hadn't taken any in about 6 wks or so.  20 mins after I popped the pills, I began to feel the usual warm awareness &amp; slight euphoria bubble up.  I listened to some music which can sound a lot better on modafinil &amp; messed around a bit on the comp.

/n
10:00 am - 100mg Modafinil, 800mg Oxiracetam
/n
This is way better than folgers in your cup.  Just a little booster to keep the morning cruisin. Oxiracetem works gives me a little kick in the pants (motivation/energy) not on the level of modafinil but it adds lucidity too.  After a little while of flying through some chores, and a lot of errands my responsibilities are done so....

/n
1:30 pm- 4 mg Lorazepan
/n
This turns out to be not what I expect.  I know I had done it once upon a time long long ago &amp; it seemed pretty fantastical.  Unfortunately about all I really noticed was a return to nomal energy level &amp; total lack of anxiety (might've killed any possible post-modafinil shakiness) but no real body high or any high of any kind that I'd remembered. Minor downer...

/n
4:00 pm - 1g Phenibut &amp; 100mg Modafinil
/n
In an attempt to finish my gumbotrip on a brigher note I add 1g of Phenibut &amp; 1 more pill of moda.  Managed to give the trip an oxymoronic feel.  Chilled out with the lorazepam &amp; phenibut but still amp'd from the modafinil booster.
/n
/n
It was pretty good all in all. I was totally coherent &amp; functional &amp; slight more than happy for the whole day.  Though I'd expected the lorazepam to have a larger effect,  So not mind blowing though If someone boxed this combo as a workweek survival kit I'd be first in line.
