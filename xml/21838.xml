A friend of mine came across some DPT and we decided to try it. Over the course of 20 minutes we insufflated two 25mg bumps. The first noticeable effects occurred at T+0:45, which included some unpleasant muscle tension along my trapezius muscles and neck muscles, along with a mild disorientation. By T+1:30, the only noticeable effects were mild visual distortion and an opiate-esque body high. These effects continued for about three hours, but at no point during the experience was there a noticeable peak or any overwhelming sensations.

From this experience, this one seems hardly worth the effort.</bodytext></report>
