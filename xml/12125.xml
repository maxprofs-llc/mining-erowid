  I began the night by taking one Ambien with a few beers. My friend had given it to me stating that it was 'not your average sleeping pill'. I was rather eager to try it since I have always been a 'pill-lover'; however, I was not expecting a great deal from a sleeping pill. In less than fifteen minutes, I felt a bit of a body buzz and a physical and mental calmness. Unfortunately, it was very mild so I decided to ingest 2 more pills.

My body relaxed and I became somewhat 'wobbly'. It was decisively different than an alcohol high. After 2 more pills and several beers, I was somewhat upbeat but had a very soothing body high. My vision became more binocular and impaired; it was difficult to maintain fixed concentration on anything concrete. Instead, my thoughts migrated to other things and I felt peaceful. Not euphoric, but calm. My attention to the environment and my judgement were clouded but my thought processes as a whole were more active. I cannot imagine why this is a sleeping pill, because I had trouble sleeping, as my mind was too busy thinking.</bodytext></report>
