It was an ordinary day, a Wednesday, nothin special. I walked through the front doors of school and walked over to one of my circles of friends. My friend gave me 3 200 mg pills of topamax. Apparently that fucks you up. I walked to 1st period, sat down, stared at the pills. I gave one away to one of my friends to get lunch money and then took the two left.

The day passes, nothing happens. 4th period comes around my tounge starts buzzing, and I'm sorta confused. Dissapointed thinking that was the high I went to eat lunch, my depth perception is out of wack. I start seeing things smaller and other things bigger. My chickenburger was bigger than normal, and I wasn't complaining. Rest of lunch went normal then I went upstairs to 5th.

WOOO the hallway looks like 5 feet wide, what the fuck is going on? I get in the classroom and sit down, stand up, and then sit down agian. A smile slaps across my face, and I just wanna start laughing. Damn I need to write some essay! I get paper and a pencil and then I can't do this. I enjoy feeling in this unporportional world.

Bell rings, I turn in my 3 sentence essay (supposed to be 30 sentences) then walk down the main stairs. I walked in the middle because the stairwell seemed so small. Went to my locker, forgot the combination, then went to class. Some giant test provided by the state, I sleep it out. 7th was a blur then I went home.

Now the effects leaving me I get home and eat food for what seemed like forever. My friends come over, we leave to go to the park. I got the bowl, they got the bud, I take 2 hits. We're just chillin for a bit, then we walk. I get so fucking happy right after we start walkin. I felt at peace with myself and everything around me. I felt like a was walking in rhythm with the birds and the trees. Hell yeh, everything was goin good. We kept walkin and I can remember everyone sayin my name, and 'Dude, he's trippin balls!!' I didn't care though I just kept walkin.

Then it hit me again. I thought I was on fire or sumthing. No wait, I was in another demension, that's right. I lost my mind for what seemed like the longest time. I blacked out. I was slapping my friends around and hitting them for no reason. I broke some of their ciggerettes, and then just took off running. I was full on sprinting when I came to a complete stop by leveling a mailbox. I got up, did some crazy stuff, and was talking complete nonsense apparently. I kneed my other friend and the ass and then took off running again.

I stopped, they caught up, I came out of that trance. I was sobered up for a full ten minutes. They told me about it, I laughed, then I walked home. I needed some serious rest, and some water. I got home and went in my room. Damn it hit me again! this time it was confusion, not anger. I went retarded. If you saw me you seriously would have thought I was out of my mind. I tried to escape this crazy warped universe through my t.v. And no, not by watching it. I tried to fit through it. I remeber looking at my hands but not seeing them. It was so strange. I walked over to the only thing I could vaguely remeber, my bed. I slept for what seemed like days but was only minutes, possibly even seconds. I kept thinking it was a new day. Then I really went to sleep.</bodytext></report>
