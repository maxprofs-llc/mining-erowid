My dad isn't cool with smoking and doing illegal drugs; but he is really big on drinking wine and tons of dietary supplements. He provides me with melatonin just in case I can't sleep. When I'm having trouble sleeping because I am stressed out or my minds racing; I can take 1 - 4 tablets of melatonin and it will gradually bring me to sleep in about a half hour.  I've also used them to abruptly change my sleep patterns when I have a tight and rapidly changing agenda.

I don't think melatonin will knock me out though; it brings ne to sleep slowly so I usually take them 20 minutes before I go to bed.

I heard from my friend's mom who is a nurse that melatonin can be addictive if misused and can start problems; I'm not sure what the problems are though.  Also to contradict that my dad has a book on melatonin that said on the cover about longer life and better health and sex aided by melatonin; so maybe it can be beneficial if used properly?</bodytext></report>
