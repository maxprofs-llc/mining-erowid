I recently came across three 1cc syringes of Ketamine in my medicide cabinet that had been intended for my dog.  At the time I first got these, I hadn't realized exactly what ket was, so I thought nothing of it.  However, being three years later when I came back across them this time, I was a bit more knowledgeable of K and its effects.  Since the dog obviously didn't need them anymore, I decided to procure them for my own usage.  I had recently made a friend on IRC who used all sorts of drugs, so I asked him how I should use the K, as well as looking around on the internet.

It turned out that all three of the needles were completely blocked from being old, and by the time I got one to a usable state, I had spilled / accidentally squirted half (1.5cc) of the ketamine on my floor and ceiling.  I did finally get a needle working though, and injected half a cc into my upper arm.  I felt the K start to come into effect quickly, but it did little more than make me woozy and nauseous.  One effect that was extremely noticeable, though, was the effect on motor control.  When moving, I felt as if I was in slow motion, but at the same time, that whatever I was moving (arm, leg, whatever) arrived at its destination before I expected it to.  The first trip was extremely uneventful, and probably shouldn't even be classified as a 'trip'.

The next evening, I injected the remaining full cc in the same area.  I felt the wooziness and strange motor control coming on again, but this time I was certainly feeling really weird in a short period of time.  I was talking to my friend on IRC while doing all this, and by the time I had typed to him that I was getting fucked up, I was already out of it beyond reading or typing.  I had read other people's accounts of feeling like they were floating around and looking at themselves from afar, but what I experienced was nothing like that at all.  I was suddenly thrust into an entirely different setting, or so my eyes told me.  I found myself soaring through a huge, spinning vortex of light and what I remember to be strange symbols.  I had an hour-long Paul van Dyk mix playing on my stereo, and I clearly remember it seeming to get louder and louder as my eyes and other senses told me I was flying through the vortex.

Another distinctly different aspect of my trip was the fact that I felt I was being compelled by this alternate reality, rather than compelling it myself.  I felt like the music was pulling me along, as I would twist and turn and change directions in response to changes in the music.  I continued this for what seemed like days on end.  Another odd thing about the music was that I had the distinct impression of 'remembering' it, rather than hearing it.  I felt that it was coming from inside my own head.  While traveling through this vortex, many ideas made themselves apparent to me.  Primarily was the idea that I had somehow accessed the 'real' representation of reality, the true backbone of all conciousness and existence, and that the 'real world' as I knew it was just a virtual reality, my body just a shell for the conciousness I knew as my 'self' to fit in and operate in the 'virtual' world.

I also had an urgent sense of needing to return to that world, even 'knowing' that it wasn't 'real'.  Somehow or another, I finally came to the conclusion that since the music was what was 'pulling' me through the vortex, that I would never be able to reconnect with the 'virtual' world unless I was somehow able to make the music stop.  It occurred to me that I could simply hit the power button on my stereo receiver, which was on the table next to my computer back in the 'virtual' world.  However, I was still in the 'stream of conciousness' and couldn't even SEE my receiver, much less use an arm I had forgotten I had to push it.  Somehow, I gathered whatever wits I still had about me, and forced myself back into the REAL real world, hit the button, and fell out of my chair onto the floor.  I crawled over to the sofa, being about as close to completely out of it as one could get without BEING completely out of it.

I flopped up on the sofa, thankful that I was back into this world, even though I had no idea what day it was.  I drifted in and out of conciousness as I tried to sleep, and every once in a while would catch just a glimpse of the outline of the room.  My vision was still pretty much worthless, and I couldn't focus on anything if I tried.  Eventually, I fell asleep, and woke up the next morning feeling completely fine, though remembering the excessive weirdness of the night before.  The best non-drug analogy to the way I felt in the trip was that I was trapped in a dream and couldn't wake up, and I felt like I would just keep on dreaming forever unless I could pull myself out of it.

Looking back on the experience, I feel like I may have pulled myself out right when it was about to get good.  Many people I have talked to have described a similar 'vortex' experience, finally arriving at something at the end of it, which I never did.  I certainly plan to try again, now that I can reassure myself that I will, in fact, wake up.</bodytext></report>
