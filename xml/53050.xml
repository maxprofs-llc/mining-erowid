I discovered salvia about 1 month ago. The complexity of the salvia experience seemingly grows with each use. A running theme I have found through my brief but facinating trips, are visuals in which I fall from 1 vision, spin/shift/rotate and find myself slipping though another portal to another vision. This typically happens several times. The relation of these types of trips to lucid dreams is also unmistakeable.

Early one morning, I sat myself on the porch and did two modest sized hits of a 20X extract. I found that anything more than that limits my ability to recall. One cannot underestimate the reverse tolerance effect of the drug.

With the sun still down and birds chirping in the background, I slipped into a salvia vision. I was in a summer time scene. Lots of people walking, bicycling etc. The hills were alive with trees and a pastel colored grass. I then felt the entire periphery of my view begin to ripple like waves. Slowly, the vision began to

sink into a vortex a few 100 yards ahead of me. I started to float backwards, slowly but steadily to view the rippling and sinking of this vision. When I broke the horizen of the view I could see the field slowly getting sucked into a wrinkled tan colored funnel. As I floated back further I noticed this funnel narrowed and terminated on the head of a human bust(basically head and shoulders). The man had his eyes closed. He was very old. There were also several other off shoots of funnels leading up to other parallel realities.

When I reflected on this trip, it seemed to me to indicate that the dream state may actually be a singular view into one of many, perhaps thousands of simultaneous stories playing within the mind at all times. I had a view to 3 such concurrent realities (dream or sub conscious realities) but perhaps there are more. How or when those realities commence is for further speculation.

How's that for a profound experience?</bodytext></report>
