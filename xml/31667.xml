This is an account of my experience with Gravol, or dimenhydrinate. Gravol is a cheap anti-nauseant with is available over-the-counter at any drug store. This was my first time experience with any sort of drug besides nicotine, caffeine and DXM (cough syrup), so I was not quite sure what to expect. I must say, that as my first-time drug experience, this was one hell of a doozy. I took 2 10-packs of Gravol (20 pills at 50mg each, 1000mg total) with some water, then began to read.

As I read, a euphoria began to wash over me in cold waves, reaching a pinnacle when the chill reached my hands and feet. I couldn't focus on the magazine I was reading at the time, so I just laid back, wrapped myself in a blanket, and closed my eyes to enjoy the pleasant feeling float me away. I fell asleep. When I awoke, I was extremely thirsty and had to urinate. Walking to the bathroom, I was extremely uncoordinated and all my limbs felt very heavy. As I went for a drink from a cup in my bathroom, I found it very hard to bring it to my mouth without it slopping all down my shirt. My hand-eye coordination was completely shot, but I was still in myself enough to realize that this was because of the drugs. A euphoria was still floating over me.

My mother comes home, and I figure I might as well go greet her. So I tramp up the stairs, with a fair amount of difficulty, I must admit, and start talking to her. My speech was completely unconnected to what I was thinking, and very slurred. This only intensified throughout the night. The speech patterns that the Gravol induced reminded me of the speech patterns of a schizophrenic; psychologists call it a 'schizophrenic word salad'. The words that came out of my mouth were connected to what I was thinking, but different in structure. I may mean to say, 'What a nice day it is,' but what comes out is, 'What a pretty moonbeam big dipper that went by.'

So, after my mother figures out I'm drugged up, I go back downstairs. However, whenever I look at any sort of flat surface, it seems covered in giant bacteria, such as those you would see if you looked through a microscope. This proceeded, much to my distress. I was beginning to lose grip with reality. I huddled in my bed, hiding from said bacterium, until I fell asleep.

Again I awoke. It was the middle of the night. I kept seeing a friend of mine throughout my house, and went to her to talk to her. She would say little, or nothing at all, then disappear. She began to appear under piles of clothes, in chairs, under blankets, and so on. Eventually, she went outside, and I followed her. This is where I lose all lucidity, and everything is much like in a dream state. My friend proceeds to a house across the street, and is promptly let in. I come up, and there is some man dressed up in a demon costume guarding the door. It is a costume party, and I cannot get in. The door guards (guards, as some would come out and talk to the other one) would tell me that all I had to do was wait to get in. The only reason I wanted to get in was to see my friend.

After waiting around this house for an hour or so (I was actually there; later, after this experience, I would walk by it and there are details in the yard that I recognise from my trip), my friend walks out and begins to fondle the bushes. I try to talk to her, but she just stares at me while softly and gingerly playing with the branches of the bush. After a while, she leaves to go teach people in the neighbourhood how to do what she was doing. I still wanted to talk to her, so I persued her. As she went from house to house, I chased her. However, as soon as I got near to her, she disappeared. She would then re-appear somewhere else, and go to another bush. She seemed to transform into some sort of fairy. I chased her like this, with her constantly disappearing, until I gave up, screamed at her, and went home.

When I got home I was scolded by my mother, being 3:00 am at the time. I went to my basement. My friend was there, and some others just like her; but she had been transformed. There, just out of my sight, were little bodhisattvas. Now a bodhisattva is basically an 'enlightened one' in the Buddhist lexicon. These took their spiritual form, as a small, childlike form in bright clothes with small hands and feet. These tormented me on the edge of my vision until I could endure no more and cowered in my room to fall asleep.

I woke up, still slightly hallucenatory but more lucid. I was dazed and a little confused about the night's fiasco, which appeared to be quite real. After 12 hours, all effects had basically worn off, and produced no hangovers or headaches. Now all of this was accompanied by severe twitching. My arms were twitching crazily almost the entire time; only about 20 hours after taking the Gravol did the twitching stop. The dehydration was also quite a dangerous factor; the only thing I could remember was that I had to stay hydrated. I was urinating about every 5 minutes at one point.

I doubt if I shall take Gravol again, at least not by myself. I am slightly schizotypal, so this drug did nothing but aggravate the psychosis that had gone long away.</bodytext></report>
