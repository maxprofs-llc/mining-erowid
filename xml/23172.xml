We were in Argentinas north, in the state of Jujuy, in a little town called Humahuaca. We were searching for mescaline containing cacti, we went to Coctaca an area where a guide told us that a mescaline containing cacti growed. But we prepare the cacti and didnt felt anything more than a stomach pain. We smoked a very bad pot and went sleep.

Some days after that we get together in that same town with some friends that came from a trip to Pers Machu Pichu and Bolivia. In Bolivia they could buy very cheap dryed San Pedro slices in 'El mercado de las brujas' in a Magic Shop they selled all kinds of powders and also San Pedro. These guys also buy some very very good marihuana in Santa Cruz, Bolivia (a city that produces lots of cocaine and specially marihuana). So we boiled the cacti slices for some hours (more than 15 slices), I have to say we where very anxious and we didnt boiled it the necesary amout of time (recommended four to six hours) so the effects of mescaline where kinda mild.

We smoked pot and walked into the dark mountain very stoned and affected by THC, in the dark cigarettes and all kinds of lights very very strong and had some kind of aura, our eyes experienced a delay. This effects could be bolivian marihuana or San Pedro, or maybe both. I really felt mescaline when I was walking in the middle of the dark later with my friend Nico heading to some girls house who lived in the end of a very dark street. In that walk I could experience the desire of closing my eyes and I did it, images and colours and strange shapes appeared, not very fluently. Despite the dark place and the cold we didnt experience paranoia or fear, something strange because some days after walking the same st. we felt a little insecure. My pupils were wide open and I felt inside a cloud or something, I closed my eyes and thinking started intense and continous. We smoked more pot during the night, but it didnt made much. When I focused my eyes everything shaked.
