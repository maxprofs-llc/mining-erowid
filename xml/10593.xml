I am writing this not to tell a great story but to show that not everyone feels the same great experience after trying coke and not everyone is addicted either.  It was friday, classes had ended and I was getting ready for the night.  Me and some friends decided to pre party a little before going out to a few fraternity parties.  So we had a few shots of tequila and a few beers and then headed over to one of the houses where we played some beer pong for a few hours. It was turning out to be a boring night so we headed back to our dorms around 2.  When we got back we smoked a lot of weed.

The next thing we know its about 4 am so I decide to take some ritilin to stay awake.  About 30 minutes later me and a friend are hanging out in this other friend of our's room.  Neither of us remmeber exactly how we ended up there, but we were soon discussing drugs.  We eventually got to the topic of coke. Me and my friend said that wer tried the shit and he pulled out a bag with a few small rocks that he said was some great coke. He divided some lines for us and himself.  I had always wanted to try coke but was really nervous because of all the stories I have read on this page about how once you try it you are addicted. But I wasn't nervous, I expect it was because I already was fucked up....so I was almost eager to snort the white dust. I stepped up to the mirror with the coke, feeling as if I was in a movie, expecting some miraculous feeling,and snorted the white dust.  I felt a burst of energy, very simmiliar to snorting aderoll or ritillin, but nothing more. I proceeded to snort more and more that night...and I still never fult much higher.

I never felt like I was on the train or anything...but rather awake yet so very sleepy, like a dream.  The feeling was overated, it was not all it was cracked up to be. I kept trying to go to sleep that next afternoon but I couldn't.  I was so very tired, yet wide awake. It was the shittiest feeling I have experienced from any drug.  I finally went to bed saturday night and slept till sunday evening. I still felt sick when I awoke.  Now that I have tried coke and saw that it wasnt all that great, I dont think I will ever do it again.</bodytext></report>
