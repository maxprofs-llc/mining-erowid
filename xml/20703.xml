I read on a couple sites that wormwood was 'inebriating' .. and I had some in my basement, so I rolled up a joint.  The smoke was really bitter and nasty and I couldn't get through all of it because it was so harsh on the back of my throught.  It made me a little light headed and then extreamely nausious.  It gave me a really gross feeling in my stomach that made me think I was going to puke.  The feeling lasted for a few hours and the nasty smell of the smoke on my fingers and clothes lasted for 2 days. I definately did not get anything good out of it and will not try it again.</bodytext></report>
