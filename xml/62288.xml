I had been going out with my girlfriend for about 7 months and it came to the night when we were goin to lose our virginity to each other. I had started taking piracetam with a friend a few days before hand, and had liked the effects of it. I took like maybe 5 grams that day, including some right before she came round after my parents left. I was really nervous as well so I drank some of my parents alcohol to calm my nerves, which was a big mistake. Piracetam increases my sensitivity to alcohol, so that small amount that I drank felt like absolutely loads.

So to cut a long story short, the alcohol-piracetam combo made me feel really drunk, and when it came to it, I couldnt get it up. I improvised, but because we're both shy, and her parents quite protective, opportunities like that dont come along very often. I didn't get another chance, because she dumped me a month ago.</bodytext></report>
