M family and I went to Albuquerque New Mexico to visit our grandparents. While we were there I found wild lettuce, opium poppies, morning glories, and best of all pituri.
/n
/n
 so I picked some of the pituri out of a dessert like field, took it back to the house, and made it into a tea and I drank it at 9:00 pm.
/n
 9:30 some effects nothing much
/n
10:00 very giggly and energized
/n
11:00 I just started tripping I can see all kinds of amazing colors in the darkness
/n
12:00 I blacked out for like 20 mins
/n
1:00 finally get to bed and have amazing dreams I that I cant remember
/n
In summary pituri is awsome</bodytext></report>
