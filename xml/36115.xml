I happend to procure whilst walking with my hound a small amount of wild growing hops, it was quiet young and the flowers were not yet quite developed only about a third of thier usual size. I dried the said hops in the sunlight.

As a test I took three leaves and four flowers and broke these up into a mixture and size affordable to rolling a herbal smoke. After rolling my herbal smoke I walked along the road in the evening air with my dog, smoking my hop cigarette - the taste was bitter but not unpalatable at first there was no noticable effect but on returning home I noticed that I was experiencing a pleasant mellow affect, I will say at this point if you are a serious cannabis smoker you will get no effect at all due to the strength of cannabis, but if you smoke occasionally you will find that you get a mellow all is well with the world, universe and God.</bodytext></report>
