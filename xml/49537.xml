I acquired about an ounce (too many to count) of small yellow and pink tablets. Not much ever happened when I ate one or two.  Eventually I decided to slam down a bunch until I felt a real effect from these small pills. I ate about three at a time every ten minutes till I reached at least twenty if not more. I was getting a weird overwhelming feeling over my body. Walking was not working out because my house felt like it was shaking up and down. Eventually I found a couch and passed out. I woke up sixteen hours later in my bedroom really weirded out but I still managed to function enough to go to school that morning.</bodytext></report>
