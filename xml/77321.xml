I decided one night to snort a 300MG Gabapentin capsule. I dumped the capsule on to the plate and snorted it. I came to one conclusion and that is to tell you that please whatever you do, don't take this crap up your nose.  It's by far the worst tasting stuff I have ever done.  Within 30 seconds of snorting the pill I began to taste the drip.  Less than a minute later, I puked.  Trying to clear out the drip I put some water up my nose which only succeeded in helping me taste a crap load more of it causing me to puke again.

Now that I have my nose cleared out I can't really taste it anymore, but I will never ever do that again. I feel nothing good out of doing this.  It's definitly not worth it.  It was smooth and there was no burning, but it was not worth it.</bodytext></report>
