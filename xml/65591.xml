I had been taking Effexor XR:150 MG per day.

I went without prescription for about 5 days, felt mild typical withdrawal symptoms. Decided to have 4-5 drinks (I have a good enough tolerance to handle way more than this.) This was followed by about 10-11 hours of vomiting. To the point where I couldn't even hold down water. I was very confused, pale, and had difficulty walking. I was taken to the hospital where a huge needle of Gravol was administered. I then slept for about 12 hours, woke up for two, then was still able to sleep for another 7-8 hours.</bodytext></report>
