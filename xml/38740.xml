I live in a very small house that is cluttered heavily with random junk from the other person living with me. They tell me they are going to be out of town for awhile, so I decide to embark on my dangerous combination experience while they are gone and I am by myself. There is nothing in particular I wanted out of this trip except to satisfy my curiosity and learn.

I already have individual experience with 5-Meo-AMT and DPT. I read somewhere that 5-Meo-AMT tends to enhance the effects of other drugs used with it. So what could be better then mixing it with DPT? Also someone else did it and they were fine, so I was ready to go. Just thinking about 5-Meo-AMT gave me chills and what drugs I was planning to do that day was giving me a strong adrenaline rush.

In the morning as soon as I woke up at 11:00am I take the 5-Meo-AMT so it wont mess up my sleep schedule, in a gelatin capsule. Then I cleaned my room and got ready for the day for 30 minutes and then shakily injected the DPT into my thigh, needles supplied under the pretense I was using them for heroin. I sort of rolled around on my bed for 20 minutes in pure JOY which usually happens with DPT. Then I pulled up my pants put on my coat and went downtown, which I've done before. I was getting the 'everything is crystal clear and super-real thing' on my way down there, also the feeling that I was a sailboat being carried downtown by the wind. I smiled at everyone I passed, as I have found this is a wonderful stretegy for dealing with people who aren't cops. I had to use the crosswalks and wait an eternity for the lights to change, instead of jaywalking. I could keep going on and on about this journey to downtown but then I would never finish this trip report or get to the interesting parts.

So I get to the area I consider to be downtown. I wonder what downtown means and sort of think of it as a stage for the whole city. I know that I am going there to perform no matter what I think about it. So my first idea, after I get to this area I have defined is to go to the red church because I remember there was an interesting thing there. Next to the church is a tree in the middle of a grassy area. Around this tree is a path made of flat stones that forms a labrynith. I have walked this labryinth before but never altered. I go to the entrance, I've had some bitter 5-Meo-AMT burps at this point. I end up walking the labryinth much faster then usual and realize that I feel really impatient and just want to get to the tree in the middle. It feels like 2 seconds and I'm there, though I never ran. I attribute this to the speedy nature of 5-Meo-AMT and it felt like it was going strong. So I'm there, and there is this octagonal bench around the base of this tree which reminds me of the I-Ching and everything looks like Waking Life.

I close my eyes and lean back on the tree as images flood through my mind and I try to pick some out to remember, which I fail at. Then I try to relax which proves difficult as I am now in the shade and realize I am shivering even though it is a warm day. I move around to the unshady side of the tree and start to relax but then I get too warm.  As I start to think about this I sense someone else walking the labryinth, I look and they are female I am single and she is attractive. She knows I am at the center of the labyrinth before she decided to walk it. So I think wow, this is great I'll just wait until she gets to the center and maybe walk out with her and then start a conversation like 'I've never seen anybody else here before, what's your name'.

So she is walking very very very very very slow in a sort of dance walk. I sit there watching her for eternity and then I just snap and I can't take it any longer. I get up abruptly and walk right through the path markings and lay down in the grass which makes me feel alot better. She leaves shortly after that point, I didn't look. I feel sort of shitty and cowardly and impatient and I say to myself that I really should have just waited. These thoughts are driving me sad, so I don't know what to do and I pick a violet flower petal from a nearby plant and place it on the grass.
/n

It works, I forget EVERTHING as I stare at this violet flower petal on some green green grass in the bright bright day. I stared at that flower petal forever and was with it and a feeling greater then I have ever felt before. It's my strongest memory. Then I got too hot so I rolled into the shade and tried again but it did not work. Then I got too cold and I rolled into the sunlight but I could not recreate what that was.

To wrap up, after that I got a vegetarian taco and forced myself to eat it even though it was not appealing at all. I walked around on the main street downtown. Certain people could tell (no sunglasses) and they smiled a knowing smile and I could feel them watching out for me. I marched with a random diversity parade and they could all tell and were affected. The parade stopped in front of a building and an abstract statue of a wrench/fish/chair. I laid down on it and stared at a powerful new megalith of a building.  While the parade chanted their chants I lay there and bent my perception of the building with my mind so it was a horseshoe shape almost touching the ground with its top. The parade moved on and I continued to lay there bending this building. I would have stayed there longer but someone was watching me and they pulled out their cell phone and were calling someone so I left. On my walk home I would guess at about 4:00pm I realized that the DPT had worn off but the 5-Meo-AMT was still going strong.

I spent the rest of the day and night listening to Shpongle and Infected Mushroom. I got a slight headache around 11:00pm and decided to go to sleep which I was able to do with a little help from some simple trance music in about an hour.</bodytext></report>
