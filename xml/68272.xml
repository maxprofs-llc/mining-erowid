I was given an olanzipine pill by a freind, approx a year ago. he said it would help with my insomnia. Oh it did that alright! I'm lucky if I get 2 hours sleep a night, normally, due to my insomnia, but after eating one of these pills, I was knocked out for a full 8 hours. Cool!!

Only problem was, when I awoke the next day I could'nt walk! It felt like gravity had been increased and just walking across the room took a huge effort. It was very unpleasant, and I won't take anymore. I am told that if you take these pills over a long period, the negative effects wear off, but I will not be taking anymore.</bodytext></report>
