I have no drugs in my system as of now, unless you would consider catnip a drug.  I have been clean for some time now, and I just tried smoking catnip for the first time.  I feel remarkably at peace right now.  It is not a high like marijuana but it is pleasant.  I notice a marked reduction in my typing skills as I write this, but I can still think pretty clearly.  This feels quite good really.  I guess if you had recently been using marijuana it would probably not be so good, but I like it.  The stuff smells remarkably like marijuana when it burns.</bodytext></report>
