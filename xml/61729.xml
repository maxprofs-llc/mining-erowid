___Notes___:

0530 - Ah, what a beautiful taste - so familiar from the liquid extract I tried before.  I'm afraid to swallow my saliva, as the Salvinorin-A dissolves in the stomach before getting a chance in the blood stream. Sigh, I really hope this works.  If not, then I'll have to smoke it.  Let's get some nice music going - while reminiscing, I might as well bring out the Infected Mushroom &amp; Shpongle.

0540 - It reminds me of plant food - or fish food - or both.  Whatever, it's just slightly annoyingly bitter.
/n
/n
0545 - Swallow - Fifteen minutes of sitting and swishing should be plenty.
/n
/n
0548 - I swear!  I'm immune to Salvia!  It must have been one of the endless shots given in the military that did it.  Ha!  Just kidding.  Really though, wtf mate?
/n
I love my Infected Mushroom though.  I'm just in the mood for it.
/n
/n
0552 - Just keep listening to music.  I don't expect anything at all to happen - not even the slight visual effects I had before.
/n
/n
1732 - I fell asleep, and felt no effects whatsoever.  Oh well.  There went about ten bucks worth.</bodytext></report>
