2c-c is not what it seems. this is my second time with the substace slightly larger dose than the 1st....this time, only all I can see is dirty chemical in my brain...not like weed or lsd which actually make me feel somewhut euphoric.

Intense headache is in the way of enjoyment. CEV's which I dont want there cuz there wrong. music is not at all comfortable so i have to turn it off. lights give me a migrane and i just spent 30 min. puking in the toilet (mind you I havent eaten since this morning) I'm very sick with pains from dry heaving.

I went into the trip excited the first time and was very dissapointed by the head pain....I went into this trip two and a half maybe three hours ago happy, thinking maybe it was my mind set last time but no. I really have a bad headache cuz of this stuff...its not good for me and not a fun hallucinogenic. I want it to wear off now this drug stinks...</bodytext></report>
