I went to my friends farm to hang out and smoke pot. He was unaware that this was my first time, even though I had experience with LSA, salvia and T3's.

I got there and we went in his house and he showed me his plastic easter egg full of pot, with more experience now, it was probably about 3 or 4 grams. We had some rum and coke (the drink, not cocaine) and went over to his neighbours house to hang out. His neighbours are stoners, and offered us some pot birthday cake, with probably 1 or 2 grams in the large piece I ate. I had no idea how far out I was gonna go, and I had thought that cannabis is a really weak drug no matter what and there's nothing it could do that I couldn't handle.

After that, we jammed, me on guitar and him on harmonica, and then after deciding that the pot brownie wasn't working (it had only been about 15 minutes), we took his easter egg full of pot and his pipe into an abandoned barn down the road. We climbed up to the top of the barn and smoked about 6 bowls of pot and then he rolled a joint and smoked that. I waited about 5 minutes and then all of a sudden I got a huge rush of euphoria, and I left my body for a couple of seconds. That was the weirdest thing I ever felt. I faded back into reality and everything was hazy and looked incredibly warped.

By this time, the sun was going down and it looked very beautiful, but very strange, as if it was an exotic thing that I kind of remembered, but seemed very new. I had a strange feeling where I felt very free, but at the same time, very trapped in this new state. I stood up and I spaced out again, repeatedly. I remember my thoughts moving in very strange patterns, that almost resembled waves, and at times, geometric shapes. I kept thinking it was a dream and that I was just on the edge of waking up, and the flow kept getting disrupted.

So it came time to get down from the barn (after a pissing contest off the roof) and then I had to jump off a ledge to get down, and while you're tripping, this is difficult, but I got down with help from my friend. We walked through the field, and the tall grass formed a sea around me and I started freaking out, getting all worried that I wouldn't come back. I had an interesting sensation where I felt like I was made out of moving metal cogs that left a trail behind them. At this point, visual trails started, too and I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. I was still paranoid, and it was as if I didn't even know my friend anymore, but somehow it was ok. We ran up the road singing the Stones song 'You can't always get what you want' and went into his house and lay on the floor between the speakers and listened to 'Whole Lotta Love.' By then I was terrified, as if it was the end, and I got strobe light vision, and trails and everything looked purplish.

I can't remember what happened next, except that we were on the computer and everything was so surreal and weird. The visual effects got less strong and my perception got a bit better. When I spoke, my words became waves, and music seemed to dance through the air, and I could see motion, and I could almost touch it.

We ordered a pizza, and went outside in the dark and jammed some more, and played some ridiculous sounding acoustic blues, with my friends surreal lyrics. I remember kicking him every time he mentioned salvia in front of his dad and his very drunk neighbours. It was fun by then, and I'd started to come down. The pizza came and it was the best thing I ever tasted. We jammed for a while, I have no idea if it was half an hour or 4 hours, and my dad came to pick me up with my grandmother.

We got home, and I found out my grandpa had died. Still intensely high on the brownie, this was a lot to handle. I have very vivid memories of seeing my grandma crying and talking to him saying 'Don't leave me' and things like that. Because of this, the other events of the trip became symbolic of my grandpa. The sunset, the feelings of death, of the end, drifting further and further out of my consciousness, not knowing if I'd come back to reality, if it was a dream, or if it was all real. I was lost in a mystical land, but back home at the same time. I've smoked up a lot and even done some psychedelics since then, but its never come close to a consciousness warping (and expanding) spiritual experience like that one before.</bodytext></report>
