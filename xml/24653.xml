Bought some catnip for my kittykats, ran out of beer, so I thought, what the hell. I've been reading experiences online so I would give it a try. I made 3 quite big joints of catnip and tobacco, about half and half. As soon I smoked first joint, I fealt a somewhat intense head rush, just like smoking bad weed. I proceeded on the 2 other joints, the feeling got more intense, but nothing really special. I walked a bit around in the woods, noticed how beautiful the nature is (hey, in midsummer it IS beautiful). After I got in and started sitting on computer, I noticed a very very slight warping feeling, nothing much.</bodytext></report>
