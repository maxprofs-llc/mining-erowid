Mmmm phenibut, it has been decribed to me before as a similar feeling to being stoned but without the headache feeling (that soapbar headache); valium; and GBL.

After drinking 8 cans of guinness, I ingested 4grams of crystal/powder phenibut. I approx had this at 9pm. Currently at 10.40pm I feel relaxed with a slight, slight euphoria but a very similar affect and feeling much like valium or even nutmeg! I feel that this is an excellent sleep aid. It has been sugested to me that it takes around 3-4 hours to work, although I think the affects take around 1-2 hours, then like EXTC or good skunk the feeling seems a while or delayed to reach its peak, but when it does it seems like bed time.

This an ok drug. Nothing special, or nothing special for someone who would want to be more social (as in going out - not sitting in yer mates bedroom!!!!) I would recommend it as an aid (used like valium) for comedowns or withdrawls.</bodytext></report>
