I have known a few people who have tried Seroquel for recreational purposes, careful, careful.

I take this stuff each and every night due to an anxiety disorder and was given a sample pack of the 200mg tablets by my doctor - my regular dose is 25mg, the 200mg were meant to be cut in 1/10ths if I was out of my 25's.

One of my mates, after asking what they did (yes they relax me and help me sleep) said f*ck it I'll slam a 200mg...... End of story! He was belted out of his brain and didn't wake up for 16 hours. This stuff has no enjoyable 'high' and will absolutely smack you up the side of the head in high doses. Just leave it alone unless you have an Anxiety, Manic or Panic disorder (or worse). Its serious stuff.</bodytext></report>
