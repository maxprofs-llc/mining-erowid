I have used kratom off and on for a couple of years now.  I was addicted tramadol as a pain killer and found that taking a tablespoon of powdered kratom leaf (not extract) followed by a glass of juice would stave off any withdrawal symptoms.  I would buy plain leaf and grind it in my coffee grinder.  The taste was bad, but with a strong juice I could quickly gag it down.  I thought it was a miracle drug that could cure any type of opiate/opioid type addiction.

To make a long story short, I began taking larger and larger amounts of kratom both in the morning and at night.  If I didn't dose, I would get achy, sweaty, and have tons of anxiety.  The most troubling was this anxiety which made me feel very, very bad.  The only thing that would relieve these symptoms was more kratom.  After several months, I would have more frequent needs to dose more often and with larger amounts to keep from going into full blown withdrawal.</bodytext></report>
