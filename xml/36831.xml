I had been taking doses from the 20 - 30 mg range for the last few months and this night I wanted to see if there were any advantages to lower doses.  The 20 - 30 range has always produced a high euphoria with please visualizations, but the body load came some times be too much.  This night was to be an experiment to see if I could keep the high without the load.  I will describe what happened.

11:15 p.m. I noticed that my stomach was getting the usual upset rumbling that it some times gets on foxy.  I ate some BK chicken to settle it down.  Effects are coming on like other experiences I've had.

11:30 p.m.  I got up to move and enjoy a new poster I got called 'mind warp.'  Its a poster with many overlapping circles that, even when sober, tend to move when I try to focus on any one circle.  It was definitely going about it's business swirling.  I noticed the usual foxy patterns and brightness in colors.  My body felt normal.

1:30 p.m.  Still had flowing patterns and brightness in colors.  Around midnight I began to think things through much more in depth.  Still no overloaded body feelings.

2:30 p.m.  Coming down, should be able to sleep soon.

Overall the night was a success.  I am able to lose my self like I normally do on this substance but with much less body load. From now on, I'll be taking lower doses.</bodytext></report>
