For reasons I will not relate, I must refrain from all drug use.  I was particularly fond of psychedelics before I stopped using.

Anyway, I turned my eyes to the good ole sanctioned three: caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.  Of these, Ive found nicotine to offer the most.

They say you shouldnt inhale cigar smoke, which is probably a good idea.  However, there is this cigar in the shape of a cigarette brand.  Its got a filter.  I find it in the cigar sectionnot in the cigarette section as with other cigarettes.  I smoke one of these and I am DONE for a good five minutes.  Im talking drooling high--not the *joke* highs I get from regular cigarettes.  I smoke it like marijuana, taking in deep inhalations and holding the breath in as much as possible.

Its dirt cheap too.  Cigarettes cost 25 cents each if I'm lucky.  These cost about 9 cents a pop.  Any way you slice it, its the best deallegal and cheap.  Best reserved for those who cant get any real drugs or especiallyas is my casethose who are weaning themselves off of real drugs.</bodytext></report>
