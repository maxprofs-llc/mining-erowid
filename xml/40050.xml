I had read about DXM a few times and the other day I decided to try it. I purchased a 200ml bottle of Robitussin extra-strength from the chemist. This product contains only DXM and therefore seemed like a safe bet. Its hard to say what mindset I was in but was in a relatively good mood.. At first I drank half the bottle over a course of an hour which brought it on kinda slow.. there was a noticeable trippy effect which made everything around me seem just a little strange and distant although it is hard for me to compare to a real LSD trip having never been on one.

At one point I decided to take a walk to the local park though once I got there the effects became more bizzare. I remember lying under a tree and closing my eyes. When I opened them I found I was completely surrounded by Magpies (an australian bird similar to a crow). For some reason this freaked me out and I felt they were getting up the courage to attack me. It seems stupid now but this was enough for me to get up and go home very quickly...

Now it wasn't until hours later (after the trip was pretty much worn off) that I started drinking.  Before drinking I had absolutely no intention of having anymore Robitussin but after polishing off a bottle of wine I went back to the fridge and this time skulled the rest (100ml) in one go.. I can't stress how much different this experience was. But let me say without any doubt mixing DXM and alcohol is BAD NEWS and no fun.. It was nothing like my earlier experience cos except for the first few minutes the whole thing is a blank. If not for the fact that my girlfriend was with me at the time I would have no recollection of what happened. I seriously think it could have even proven fatal.. but here goes. (bearing in mind I remember none of this. it is my girlfriend who had to endure it)

After crashing onto the floor I totally lost control of my body.. this included shitting my pants and vomiting. My girlfreind somehow managed to get me on my feet and into the shower. But she says when she came back to check on me I was spraying the shower all over the bathroom. When she asked I replied that the floor was dirty and I needed to clean it... theres more to tell but there isn't really much point. Just bear this in mind: drinking 100ml was fun.. drinking 100ml with wine.. FUCKED! it coulda killed me if I was alone. I have read other peoples experiences who say that they have mixed DXM and alcohol but I honestly don't see how. And it just aint worth it. I coulda lost my girlfriend over this.. Be warned!</bodytext></report>
