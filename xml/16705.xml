Mindset: Slightly apprehensive about my first time smoking salvia. Read about it for quite some time and have been desiring to try for a while. I'm a lucid dreamer-when I manage to not fully realize that I'm dreaming. I'm a fairly experienced psychonaut, having done LSD many times, 2CB, mushrooms, ecstasy, and various combinations of the above. Fully aware that Salvia will be NOTHING like any of the above, but I still don't know what to expect.

Setting: Outdoors camping 'rave' style party. Night time (about 11:30 PM) and very dark. Two good friends and I, in a tent. No music, the generator has gone out for the time being. We're camped in a remote portion of the available land. No distractions.

I took my first toke. Long, and slow, being sure to hold the butane jet-flame on the salvia as long as I was inhaling. I no longer smoke cigarettes or marijuana, so this hurt my throat-it's a relatively harsh, hot smoke. This could be alleviated with a waterpipe I'm sure.

I'm holdingholding it in for about 20 seconds before I slowly and controlled exhale. Almost immediately I get a tingling sensation inside and towards the top of my nose, and what felt like behind my eyes, in my sinuses. As I said to my friends, but don't remember saying, 'The front of my sinuses feel funny.'
/n
/n
I take my second toke, same as before, long and slow, and hold it in for a good amount of time. My movements start really slowing down-or they feel like they do. Now the tingling sensation has spread to the tips of my fingers and my feet. I feel gravity pulling me downhill towards the front of the tent. I know I'm not moving but I can't help feeling like I am. Almost like a trust fall, when you go below where you think the ground should be.
/n
/n
I'm becoming extremely disoriented; somehow I manage to get the pipe up to my lips for the third toke and ignite. Same as before, except this time I see the sparks of a cashed bowl flying through the pipe, so I set it down. I almost dropped it, because at that point, I was rapidly being transported to a different reality. I mean, it hit me like a freaking sledgehammer, unexpected, hard and heavy, a complete mindjob.
/n
/n
All of a sudden, it's extraordinarily hot in the tent and I'm sweating profusely, so I rush to get my hoodie off as fast as I can-as if it were life and death if I didn't.

I don't ever remember closing my eyes, but I'm sure I did. Regardless if I did or didn't, I do know that I 'saw' myself, still looking out through my own eyes, watching my two friends that were there with me. Butthis was different. WTF? I've done this before! No! Not the salvia I mean! I didn't even think of the salvia, I had totally forgotten about it. THIS! RIGHT NOW! THIS MOMENT!
/n
/n
I've been here, played out this exact moment before. Maybe once, maybe a thousand times. What's going on? I've had deja vu before--this exceeds any deja vu feeling I've ever had before. But this extends beyond the current moment, now I've lived this life a hundred times, a thousand timeswho knows? Certainly more than once. 
/n
/n
And thenI'm out. That's it. It's freezing! Why am I so cold? It's not cold out here! Afterglow is very introspective and thoughtful, but I find myself questioning what the hell just happened in that maybe three minutes that I was out there-what felt like half an hour.
/n
/n
I've thought (since I studied atomic chemistry and quantum mechanics in High School [physics/AP physics/chemistry]) (I refuse to believe, I just have ideas) in multiple levels of existence. Everything around us is matter, slowed down, sped up, in various forms. A spirit, or a soul, would be nothing more than a collection of energy in a higher state (a higher valence shell, to make a poor analogy) than what we call reality right now.
/n
/n
So now I think, 'Have I been here before? Was that really Deja Vu? Or' with the sheer number of people on this planet, there HAS to be some other set of friends, sitting in a tent, smoking salvia, somewhere 'was I temporarily in my counterpart's existence? Something like when I receive somebody else's conversation on my cordless phone, they can't hear me but I can hear them?'
/n
/n
I'm not entirely sure what to make of this. I don't know whether to think if time is circular, running in loops (which brings me to entirely new tangents of metaphysical spirituality) or if we share a collective consciousness - an unconscious sharing of thought energy - and I was sharing somebody else's experience with them, or if I was sharing a spirit's former physical life's experiences, etc

I will try Salvia again. She has not shown me all of her cards yet. I did not encounter the spirit of Salvia herself, but I would like to meet her. I know she has a lot to show me, I don't know if I'm ready for it, but I'm never ready for new knowledge. I learn to be adaptable with it the moment it makes itself apparent. I either learn it or dismiss it at that point, depending on how open-minded I am.
/n
/n
I have never had such an intense and thorough bout of introspection and spiritual thought as I did during and immediately after the experience.
/n
/n
I do have to admit, I am a little scared of what she may show me next time, but I am curious, and, as a philosophy several racers say, 'No fear is dangerous. Some fear is beneficial. Face it.'

This is not a recreational drug. This is not tripping. This is more like lucid dreaming, while awake. Perhaps it is in fact a window to other dimensions. This is a tool to get myself one step closer to my own personal enlightenment. It is not to be taken lightly.</bodytext></report>
