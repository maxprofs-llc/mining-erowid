So, I finally have the chance to try DMT in a suitable setting. Apart from a brief encounter with approximately 3mg earlier in the week this is my first real try with this legendary substance.

I prepared a makeshift pipe with 20mg of this sticky orange waxy substance and sat down under a beautiful old beech tree situated just to the left of the front elevation of Waylands Smithy and began to prepare myself in quiet reflection.

When I felt ready I brought the pipe to my lips and applied the flame. Almost immediately white wisps of smoke began to boil off the surface of the now liquid DMT and I inhaled deeply. The taste/smell was typical indole and, not surprisingly, very much like DPT. The acridness of the smoke and a wave of fear caused me to hold back and I estimate that I got about 10mg of the original 20mg.

Literally within minutes the effects made themselves felt. Colour intensity rose sharply as did texture/hue perception. A few seconds later the visual distortions began. Everything became fluid and danced with an enchanting energy  utterly bewitching. Interestingly (and unexpectedly) I noticed many parallels with 2CB including a peculiar effect I experience when perceiving 3D space that is very difficult to explain. The effects where still building fast and I began to see within this 3D space the chrysanthemum pattern associated with DMT. It was very beautiful - crystalline and colourful. At this point I began to hear a wonderful celestial chiming/ringing/singing that seemed to be calling me or was at least directed towards me. I also perceived a very strong presence that to me was a latticework of many things  too many to remember, but my Mum and Dad (or archetypal parents?) where a prominent element of this lattice and I began to feel that this was a perception of all divine possibility. As I contemplated this, the effects began to subside and I began to whisper thank you again and again  I was completely euphoric. I gathered myself up and began to make my way back to the camp unable to stop smiling and laughing. I continued to experience visual and mood enhancement for the next hour or so. I felt physically rejuvenated and totally at peace. Throughout the remainder of that evening I continued to recall aspects of the journey that I had forgot and compared experiences with Tim around the campfire. In retrospect it was probably a good thing that I only used half of the 20mg in the pipe. Considering the effects of 10mg I would have been a little startled by the effects of 20mg. The visual element of DMT was simply incredible. Although this experience was in no way strong, the patterning was incredibly complex and I discussed with other members of the group a need for a word that describes the property of populating surfaces or spaces with patterns.

In all this was a very positive experience left me wanting to investigate the higher effects.</bodytext></report>
