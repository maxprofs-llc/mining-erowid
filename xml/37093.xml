I wanted to try ayahuasca or one of its analogues, so i ordered some up and set to work. I live in college dorms with a community kitchen so i wasn't particularly comfortable with lengthy extractions involving hours of boiling. My initial trials with quick preparations involved putting around 6 grams of mimosa hostilis root bark in a coffee grinder until it was for the most part a fine powder. The powder was then placed in a regular paper coffee filter and into a quick-brew type coffee maker (not a drip-brewer). I then ran 1 cup of distilled water with a few squirts of lemon juice in it through the machine. Each extraction took about 10 or so minutes, and after the first cup of water the filter needed to be changed because of clogging.

These short-period methods were effective, but not up to DMT's potential. The trips began with the ingestion of 2 teaspoons of ground syrian rue, waiting for the effects of the MAOI to kick in, then drinking the 2 cups of mimosa juice by taking a gulp once about every 2 minutes and rinsing my mouth with lemon juice until it was all gone. The nausea set in immediately after consumption, but i always fought vomiting until absolutely necessary. Puking is never fun, but it was never really too horrible or violent, and the third time i only gagged. The sickness always went away pretty much right after.

These coffee machine preparations resulted in what i'd describe as mid-dose acid trips (not really, but i can't think of any other effective analogy) complete with flowing visuals and intospection. I enjoyed these trips immensely, and went pretty much sleepless for 3 days, because i dosed 3 nights in a row.

I needed a break for about a week or so, to catch up on sleep and give my brain a rest. I read about other preparations online, and my interest was piqued by an article i read about the nausea of ayahuasca being caused by the extraction of tanins when mimosa is boiled. So, i decided to try my own cold-water extraction.

I ground about 6 grams of mimosa in my coffee grinder like before. I put it in a tupperware container with 1 cup of distilled water and lemon juice, mixed it thoroughly, then placed it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day the water had turned a dark purple-ish color. I strained it through a paper coffee filter and squeezed it out as best i could, and placed it in the fridge.  I then took the ground-up mimosa and placed it back in the container, and added another cup of water. I let it sit overnight again, strained in the same manner as the first batch, then combined the liquids. I placed the 2 cups of brew in a pot, and proceded to evaporate off a portion of the liquid, never allowing it to get hot enough to boil. When i was finished there was approximately one cup of dark purple/brown liquid. I placed it in the refrigerator, ground and consumed my rue (no preparation, just swallowing it one tsp at a time, wrapped in tissue), and waited for the effects.

Some friends invited me along to pick some things up from the store, and i said i'd go if they waited until i threw up (they knew about my previous excursions), and they agreed to stay. Once i was feeling the effects of the rue, i drank the mimosa brew in 4 or 5 gulps over a 10 minute period. The other times i had experienced the nausea immediately, but not like this. I held back my gag reflex numerous times, but eventually gave up and vomited violently about 30 minutes later, which dissappointed me because i had held it for at least an hour the previous times. I didn't feel altered in the slightest, except for the effects of the rue, and left for the store.

We were there for a good 30 minutes or so, and i became very dissappointed as i wasn't feeling the slightest tryptamine effect. I accepted defeat and went to a fast food restaurant to get something to eat, since i had fasted all day.  I had 1 cup of caffeinated soda, but wasn't concerned because i drink a lot of caffeine, and had consumed it under the use of MAOI's before, to no ill effect. All of a sudden, i got that 'something's different' feeling, and noticed a slight morphing and rippling effect. This was about 1 hour 15 minutes after vomiting. I thought that perhaps the caffeine was somehow triggering the small amount of DMT in my system. I mentioned it to my friends, and said i was happy, because tripping a little was better than nothing. My friends wanted to pick up a movie from a rental place down the street, so we went there and since i was tripping a bit, decided to wait in the car.

I felt something, subtly, creeping up on me. Nothing intense, just this ringing in my eyes and feeling in my head. I initially got a little worried, because i thought that perhaps i'd had too much caffeine. Then something happened. An analogy that i'd read somewhere that was something like 'a butterfly floating in front of a speeding freight train' comes to mind. I squirmed in my seat and tried to keep my eyes focused in an attempt to regain my bearings. I was lost in a sea of intensity, an ocean of flowing colors and complicated patterns. I sat in that car for an eternity, asuring myself it wasn't happening.

I won't get lost in detail trying to describle the undescribable, as there are already plenty of reports that explain much more elegantly than i could, but in summary i tripped harder than i ever thought possible, and saw for a brief moment the 'dmt elves' even. The peak effects only lasted for around an hour or so, and once i regained my senses i was still tripping harder than i had ever before (excluding the previous hour, of course), and it seemed like absolute mudanity!

So, it is safe to say the cold-water method does work, however with my lack of experience i can't say that it is as effective as more tried and true techniques. All i know is it worked for me, and after a short break, i hope to try my luck a little further down the rabbit hole.
