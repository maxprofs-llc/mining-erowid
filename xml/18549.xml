We were four to test the new substance, in cool sweet tasting smoothies. Using frozen tropical fruit along with tropical fruit juice and extra sugar, the dried powdered cactus was delicious. We seperated each 20 gram dose into 3 to 4 glasses and drank them over a period of about an hour.

One fellow in our group felt slight nausea for about 45 minutes, the rest of us felt fine. The effects began while we were still sipping the last of our concoction, with a tingle in the lips and a buzz in the brain. After a little while a bubbling sensation began in my stomach, with fits of giggling to continue uncontrollably for the rest of the trip.

No Paranoia, No self loathing. Only warmth and vibration. Intricate delicate patterns behind the eyes. Everyone has a beautiful aura dancing around them. Everyone is beautiful. No trouble socialising. It`s so peaceful, I could sleep if I needed to. When I closed me eyes and relaxed, I could feel a breeze blow faintly through me. Almost as if I`m under water feeling the slight movement of the earth itself. I could even feel slight pressures around me, moving. Like beautiful buzzing creatures of consciousness. I could swear I`ve discovered the land of faery. It`s all around us, ready for the moment that we`re willing.</bodytext></report>
