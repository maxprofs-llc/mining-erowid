I had been on a booze fast for 10 days because my tolerance had accidently gotten too high basically to the point where I felt nothing off four beers. I had been drinking 12 drinks a week 4 at a time for a month. Usually I only drink 8 a week but it was summer. I have been drinking since I was 14. Anyways I decided to stop for 10 days to try and bring my tolerance back down. This was due to my desire to not drink more.

Anyways after those ten days I ended up drinking 4 beers over an hour and a half which is pretty slow for me. Surprisingly I was as drunk as I had been when I first started drinking. I felt great and fell asleep after an hour of fun. Basically I'm just curious about how fast one gains and looses alcohol tolerance because it seemed to me as if I had a large change over a short period of time.</bodytext></report>
