The following is an account of my experience(s) with one of the chemically altered herbal blends known as 'Spice', more specifically, 'Spice Diamond'.

I heard about the 'Spice' herbal blends on an internet forum for marijuana smokers. Someone on the forum mentioned that they bought it from a stand in the mall that is across the street from where I live. So, one day, out of curiosity, I bought it.

When I got home, I took out a blunt, filled it with the Spice Diamond and rolled up a joint just for myself. The initial experience goes as follows (the following times are rough estimates; not 100% accurate): 
/n
/n
2:20pm - I lit the blunt and took only two hits. Felt nothing really.
/n
/n
2:30pm - I took a third hit. Didn't really feel much.
/n
/n
2:40pm - Starting to feel a head buzz, relaxed feeling. It starts to slowly get stronger.
/n
/n
3:00pm - Buzz felt like it was wearing off already, so I took a few more hits. 
/n
/n
3:15pm - Starting to feel the 'rising' feeling that I get from marijuana. I'm starting to feel it stronger now, and it is VERY similar to weed.
/n
/n
3:18pm - I start to listen to some music, and it is ORGASMIC--the same effect that weed has when listening to music--feeling like I am one with the music, hearing instruments that I never bothered to listen to before, etc. The Spice Diamond really made me feel quite euphoric as I sat back and listened to my favorite music and watched television. 
/n
/n
3:45pm - Feeling a bit tired now, sleepy if you will. I can never remember what happens or exactly how long a 'trip' lasts while smoking Spice Diamond, because I always fall asleep without realizing that I am falling asleep.

I've smoked Spice Diamond several times since then. I have ZERO problems with short term memory from it (as others report), and ZERO disorientation the next day. The only thing I would say about this is that I am VERY tired the next day after smoking it, but only if I smoke it at night when I am already tired. If I smoke it during the day and it wears off, then I'm fine.

Again, the Spice Diamond brand I smoked is very, very similar to weed. The only difference for me is that it did not last as long as a marijuana high for me (only about two hours max, if that--maybe I don't smoke enough of it?). Also, I felt like I had to smoke more to keep the high going--with weed, I never have to do that; I can take a few hits of weed and be high for five or six hours straight without smoking it again after that.

All in all, a great 'legal' alternative for anyone worried about getting busted with weed.</bodytext></report>
