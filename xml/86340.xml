I have literally tried almost every opiate/opioid on the market and have a lot of experience with them. My painkiller habit is now ten years old. One day I went to my supplier looking for my usual dose of dilaudid two K4's and he didn't have any but he said he had some Opana 10's. I had heard about this pill from other junkie's and thought I would try it, anything is better than being sick I thought to myself.

So I found myself in my bathroom after working up the whole 10 mg pill in an 80cc shot and BANG I felt a rush similar to dilaudid only more intense. The only way to describe it is a warm, bone crushing, and euphoric feeling. I instantly fell in love with the semisynthetic opioid. I quickly found myself needing to fix every six to eight hours and in that respect is very similar to heroin.</bodytext></report>
