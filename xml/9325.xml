   I inhaled.

              I exhaled.

A few seconds later, I was overwhelmed by the drug. The feeling was of urgent distress. I felt stuck, both physically and mentally. I could hardly move, but I crawled towards the balcony to look outside. I looked over at the building across from the one I was in. The wall was bending and swirling. I kept getting higher and higher.

Regret set in, I wished the feeling would go away. As soon as I made the wish I realized it would not come true. I was on a drug, it was taking effect, and I had to bear that effect until it expired. I wanted to make the feeling go away. Throwing up and banging my head against the walls crossed my mind. I didnt do any of these things, I just kept sitting in front of the balcony door, watching the wall swirl and twirl.

                                       'know'.

Eventually I stopped getting higher, at which point I gave in to it. I accepted the feeling as part of me for the rest of the trip, and thoroughly enjoyed the comedown.
/n
/n
The secret... let it flow through. I was trying to figure out the feeling... I was trying to gain control over it. Once I realized I had no control... once I gave up and let it push my mind around, I saw some incredible things.

                          IS

Everything around was alive, breathing, vibrating, communicating, with me. I was at a friends house, and his mother has a thing for frogs. There was a stuffed toy frog between me and the balcony door. I looked down at it and it told me a lot about what life at that particular apartment is like. It didnt open its mouth and speak, no. Just by looking at that frog I got a feel of the permanent mood of the apartment, and the people in it.

                    Life...

                            is enigma.

That night I learned quite a few important lessons. In this life, the only thing you actually control is your own reactions to what is happening. Everything else is beyond your control. If you look carefully, a tiny rock on the side of the road could teach you a lot about the journey you are on. Nothing is insignificant.

Open your eyes, open your mind. Look around, at the big big wide picture. At our world, in which everything is the way it is. Why are YOU HERE?
