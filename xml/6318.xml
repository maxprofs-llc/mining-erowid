It was Saturday 7 of April and I met up with my closest friend whom I had not seen for a number of weeks we had some alcohol and hash and decided to take some magic mushrooms which I had stored in some organic honey.  It was difficult to measure dosage so a few teaspoons per cup of tea was to do the trick.  We drank it down and noticed effects within 30 min.

The effects were confusing and frustrating, however within the hour we had settled into a very intense trip with short-term memory lapses and visuals etc. that are common in decent trips.  A few hours passed and we began to feel like coming down so we smoked a few bowls of hash.

All was going well until I felt all the blood-vessels on my neck dilate and pulsate in a very distressing way I asked for my good friends hand to help calm me (it was just the two of us in my flat at about 3:40am) but something was pulling me away from the physical world and my vision closed up and I sank deeeeep into my brain and away to another place.  An intense rush of visuals and emotions followed and I felt as though something was communicating with me..... my vision opened again to the sight of my friend screaming into my face to 'stay with me'.

We decided to get some air and go outside (I wretched on myself) I stood up and collapsed next to the door in the room and fell away again I briefly saw myself from about 2 meters away in a state of seizure with my throat extremely pronounced and dilated.  I again came to as my friend helped me up once more but this time I hesitated as I wanted to go back to find out something and I repeated to my friend (who was now in a serious state of shock) that 'its ok its ok its good'.

I made it to the top of the stairs where I was launched into the cosmos once more where a 1000 images and emotions blasted through my being.  The most predominant one was of a fish like embryonic creature that wasn't separate to me but was everything that I know or could know-past, present, future..... everything.  I cant explain what IT was but it was not negative but was very otherworldly yet with a distant familiarity.  This sounds like bollix but I cant really understand what I felt/saw.

We made it to the cold bathroom where I regained myself however my mate and I were very traumatized for another few hours as we tried to piece my mind together with another friend who thankfully and randomly called by after the clubs.  I shall never forget this and will be far more careful and respectful of the Shrooms in future as during one of the 'seizures', my friend said that I did not breathe for about 1min.  It is also worthy of note that I had been taking St. John's wort for depression for about a month. Thanks for reading this and take care.</bodytext></report>
