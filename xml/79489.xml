23.53 Feel very happy good to talk to people over the phone, would be worried about being in public due to gurning as normal for me with stimulants and serotonin antagonists.

Went for cigarette, still a bit gurney but feeling good, nice an replacing with a rush running in the back ground similar to mdma. Nice to have a cigarette v relaxing. Bit of dry mouth so advised to drink water.

Good fun all round and more reliable than illegal substances. But my experience with chemicals in this category is that if taken in moderation than the negatives are similar to drinking.
