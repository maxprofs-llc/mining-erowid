My first time taking LSD was on a warm, sunny Sunday afternoon in February, towards the end of the summer in Melbourne.  I have been taking 20mg fluoxetine daily for depression for most of the past 10 years.  I was intrigued by the reports that fluoxetine diminishes the LSD effects.

At 11.30 AM I cautiously cut the first of the two blotter squares (with a Pharoah picture on them) and let it stay under my tongue for a few seconds before chewing it and swallowing it.  An hour passed and I felt no different.  I took the other half of the first blotter square, waited another half hour and was still not feeling anything.  Impulsively I took the whole other square.  Then I relaxed on the couch with a book and tried to forget about the LSD altogether.  Perhaps it was a weak lot of acid.

By about 1.30 PM I was feeling distinctly different.  I felt sort of hot all over, my skin felt sweaty and my limbs felt very light.  When I walked it felt like I was walking on a trampoline and I was bouncing up and down.  My mood became somewhat euphoric and noticed that I found it hard to communicate without giggling at the absurdity of everything that I contemplated.

Then I noticed that objects took on a new vivacity, a sense that I was perceiving their 'true' form.  All objects, including inanimate objects, seemed to be communicating their essence in a sort of emotional signal of some sort.  It was like the veil of dull reality had been lifted and things became full of life.  An empty clothes-rack (one of those ones in the shape of an X) became a stern-looking woman with her hands on her hips.  Two bags of nuts lying on top of each other became two beautiful things in loving embrace with each other.  Flowers opened to the sky in sheer joy.  I stress that I was not experiencing visual hallucinations or even visual illusions - I saw no peculiar colours, shapes or patterns.  What changed was the emotional valence attached to the environment.

I decided to take the dog to the park, and when he was eagerly tugging me along the pavement it felt like my arm, holding the lead, was being pulled out from my body and visually perspective shifted when I looked at the dog so that my hand holding the lead seemed suddenly to be very far away.
/n

In the park I was overwhelmed by the beauty and the life surrounding me and I laid down on my back feeling the warm sun-baked grass beneath me.  When I closed my eyes I noticed some flashing and moving geometrical patterns, but they weren't very intense.  I got up and noticed another man roughly my age walking his dog.  I was enraptured by the beauty of his masculine body, and coudn't help smiling; I felt like what I imagine a dog must feel like when he sees another dog - just bursting with the  delight of mutual attraction and desire to play together.  I was conscious of this feeling and able to note it objectively and not allow it to dictate my behaviour unchecked.  Although I felt very physically attracted to him I did not feel aroused.  It was more like I was unable to take my eyes off the visual feast that his presence embodied.

When I passed him he said 'its a great invention isn't it?' presumably referring to the dog ball-thrower we were both using, although my first understanding of his question was that he was referring to LSD.

After I returned home, at about 4:00 PM my boyfriend drove the car down a few blocks to the local Asian grocery store with me in the front passenger seat.  I quickly understood how dangerous it would be to drive while under the influence of LSD.  When I looked at roadsigns, they seemed to convey no meaning, they looked so absurd I laughed out loud.  
/n

In the grocery store I was standing in the middle of a rather narrow aisle between rows of well-stocked shelves.  When I looked up and down the aisle, the ground seemed to curve upwards, like I was at the bottom of a deep hole.  I had to leave the shop because the distortion of perspective was becoming too intense.

Out of curiosity, at some stage early in the afternoon I jacked off, but it wasn't especially different from normal, in fact probably less satisfying if anything.

When I was sitting in the lounge-room at about 6:00 PM I looked at the clock on the wall.  For a brief moment, none of the ticks (marking the hours on the clockface) seemed any more meaningful than the others, and I had to make an effort to tell the time.

I retired to bed at about 8:30 PM and noticed that objects around the bedroom were gently breathing or slowly getting bigger then smaller.

The next morning I felt completely normal.

I was subsequently told that the acid was quite strong and surprise was expressed by the man who gave it to me that I took two at once, never having taken it before.  Perhaps if I was not taking fluoxetine the effects would have been a lot stronger.
/n

A final note - I had read elsewhere that LSD is something that some people don't want to repeat for while, not because it was unpleasant, but because it is such a long-lasting distortion of mental functioning.  I certainly felt like I would like to take it again, but not for another few weeks at least.</bodytext></report>
