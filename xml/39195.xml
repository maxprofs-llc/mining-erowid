I was on this stuff for a seizure disorder I was diagnosed with at military school. The 1st time I took it it was through an IV... this med made me feel straight up hammered for the 1st week I was on it. If anyone is going to use this recreationally just do it once. It made me seriously depressed and an asshole for the whole year I was on it. As soon as the doc took me off I had another seizure. He gave me kolonopins and some other shit instead, so I cant complain. Stay away from this drug for regular taking, once or twice is ok.</bodytext></report>
