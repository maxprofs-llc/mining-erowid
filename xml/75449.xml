I inhaled about 4 cases of 24 cartridges per day for 2 days. I have been experiencing tinnitus in my left ear for about 2 weeks now. The tinnitus sounds like crickets outside a window. The volume varries thoughout the day. I also have a lingering hallucination. It appears to be an orange and green disco ball in the center of my vision that multiplies into a pattern at the peak of the experience. Though it is brighter during nitrous use, I can still see it days later. The further I am from use the fainter the pattern, but its almost as if I can still make out the outline.</bodytext></report>
