Ive been taking vicodin a week now for an injury last week and just bought melatonin for enhancing my dreams, anyways I took 2 melatonin tablets and 1 vicodin and just sat there for a while waiting to go to bed. After a while I felt like I had taken lots of vicodin (a lot more than I actually had taken) and felt really good. I laid down and turned off my lights and noticed like a grid of colors(weird as it sounds its true).

It wasnt like tripping just seeing them. After that I closed my eyes and I would just start thinking about something and it would just run on and on until I realized what Im thinking of is stupid. For example I was talking to myself as if I had 2 personalities. After that I must have fallen asleep and I had very vivid dreams. I know Im not just a light weight for vicodin because Ive taken it a lot and this has never happened. My past drug experience has been Weed, DXM, Shrooms, Vicodin, Alcohol, Oxycontin, and I think thats it.</bodytext></report>
