Saturday, noon

The first thing I noticed was I that I felt tired and a little confused, which I attributed to the 4-5ish grams of mushrooms and ecstasy pill I had taken earlier. My girlfriend, A, had done the same (we have 9 grams of shrooms and just split them as best we could). They were good mushrooms. But this ecstasy has a weird come-up. Kinda negatively colored the beginning.

A, and I were out across the street from her house smoking some pot when she started acting weird. She was insisting she was going crazy. I reminded her of the mushrooms (weve both tripped enough times before), but she insisted it was insanity for a little while. So we went back inside to listen to some music, said hi again to Gary the painter, and laid on her bed feeling the drugs start to slither around.

With my eyes closed, I didnt see anything that intricate yet, but I saw colors, and I had some intense thoughts. Lots of What the fuck. and Oh, god, then, but what if. Webs of conspiracy. Dangerous thinking. I opened my eyes and noticed her knife-painted walls starting to melt. We werent even touching much. Strange ecstasy. We got up, I sat and she walked around a little, and I saw the room trip out beautifully. I saw the clock in double at first, and then the pattern on the quilt started to run like a stream. The lights on the ceiling made tracers whenever I moved my eyes. It was fun to look at, but it was a small room, and my head felt like it was about to explode. We went outside, taking with us one more pill (of a better batch) and most of an ounce of great bud, and sat out by the public pool (no one was there).

While we sat there, I learned that the authorities were in possession of some possibly incriminating recordings of mine, concerning drugs, but from a sober perspective I had nothing to worry about at all. Wouldnt even have crossed my mind. But I came up with an extensive theory on how I was going to be in very serious trouble with the law. After sitting around and talking about it for a while with A, I noticed a woman swimming quietly in the pool (maybe it was just that the auditory hallucinations were loud) near us, and decided she was going to go report us for talking about drugs. But I put this all aside and had a cigarette. Im on mushrooms, I decided. Not worth thinking about.

After putting out the cigarette, I started pulling apart the little tobacco and filter remains, examining it very thoroughly. The light on the water seemed to be moving about ten times faster than it normally does, as did the clouds. All the noises were magnified. Construction nearby was a lovely-sounding chorus, overlaid with some pretty amazingly hallucinated-upon bird calls. Everything took on that tinge that you can really only picture if youve seen it before. Everything is much, much richer, all the colors and textures. We sat and talked for a long time, starting to feel the ecstasy. The hour or two peak with it is wonderful.

This is all pretty standard trip stuff. Heres where it gets really neat:

There was a tree in front of us whose leaves started to change colors. And those bird calls. We started noticing birds. Flocks of martins would fly overhead, and each one would have several copies flying around it. All of this going much faster than theyre normally perceived to fly. Earlier, as we had been driving up, a buzzard had flown right in front of the windshield of the car. I saw the buzzard again, and I still cant decide whether or not it was real. I saw it flying crazily, either way.
/n

I noticed to my left a mud-dauber about ten feet away  from that distance it appeared to be about three or four inches, long, curled circularly and zooming around across the grass liquified in wind. I saw a yellow bird that I know doesnt exist in real life land nearby. I saw a black butterfly appear out of the sky, fly at a great speed across the grass, and disappear. Then I saw it again. The forest trees were all melting into one another a few dozen yards from us. There was a large, dead trunk on the edge of the forest, and all of a sudden it began to sprout yellow flowers over its entire body. We decided to go behind a small building to lay in the grass and watch the sky, and did so for a long time. I picked a piece of grass and it turned to gold. We talked for a long time. This was one intense motherfucker of a trip.
/n
/n
We went back to our previous seats, and I looked at the fence and saw a dove-like bird, with huge, red, feathered bulbs on its back, massive eyes and a long beak. I saw a hummingbird fly by and disappear just like the butterfly. An Asian man and his son were at the pool, and they looked beyond strange. There were no mirrors around, thankfully. People look so strange. Briefly, my web of conspiracy resurfaced, and I was sure they were going to go call the police (we did look more or less fucked up). I got it back down, though. I looked down at the deep red-purple, concrete ground and saw it turning yellow in incredibly intricate patterns, flowing all around its surface. Its a huge surface.
/n
/n
The comedown was fast, mostly just feeling tired, still getting plenty of hallucinations (but not peaking) and laying around. A threw up. She always throws up, so no worries. We looked around for the ounce and pill, and they had disappeared. Completely. Our conclusion was that we left it on the table when we went to lay in the grass, and some kids had stopped by and had their day suddenly become really great.

I got a cab home, where I needed to be, still getting weird distortions, auditory and visual. The cab driver was on his cell phone and spoke in an Arabic language the whole way to my house. I decided it was the most beautiful language Ive ever heard. At first I thought I might be hearing Portuguese, but, when nothing made sense, I realized that it was from the Middle East.
/n
/n
I got home, laid in bed and listened to music, then watched a movie. The visual distortions didnt completely end until 8 and a half hours after I first gobbled the mushrooms. I was exhausted from the ecstasy. And it was one of the best trips of my life. I think the stimulants that were undoubtedly in the ecstasy pill made it possible, at the peak, to just sit calmly observing the most radically altered universe I've ever been, except with salvia. But that's another story entirely.</bodytext></report>
