8:30pm  Using a liquid measuring syringe, I measure out 1ml of my vodka/5-meo-amt mixture (50mg 5-meo-amt in 50ml of vodka).  I measured out the 5-meo-amt powder as exactly 50mg on my digital scale (2mg accuracy).

9:15pm to 3:30am  I feel talkative I feel like yakking about whats going on tomorrow, but Im refraining because this is a trip report.  Company comes and goes, various friends of mine, we play magic the gathering, we talk, drink coffee, eat donuts.  I seemed to experience slight lack of concentration, but was quite focused when doing a single specific task, or conversing with one person Im not sure if this is because I read thats what happens in multiple trip reports and I just superimposed that imaginary effect onto myself or it was actually happening.  Nice body buzz, drinking lots of water and urinating frequently (though the coffee likely played a part in that, as it is a diuretic).  Not much is going on, but I like whats going on.  Im just a little cheerier, social interaction makes me quite complacent though, everyone is gone now, and Im still quite complacent, No visuals.  Stretching feels good.  I dont think my friends knew I was on anything, except for the one I told, even then he didnt notice any difference in my behavior.  Im at a +1 (Shulgin Scale), this isnt getting any stronger than it is now.  Tomorrow I think Im going to try 1.5mg and see what happens.  Im considering going skateboarding, I think I could drive actually (not that I would tempt fate by doing so), so I should be able to skateboard, worst case scenario I fall off my skateboard, so off I go (well see if physical activity will increase the effects at all).  Im seriously having trouble resisting typing up stuff that has nothing to do with this trip report, I want to talk about how Im putting Liszt on my mp3 player, and how Ive been looking for more classical music mp3s and how theres a lot of classical music on SACD and DVD-Audio that Id love to hear, and tell you about the benefits of SACDs and DVD-Audio discs etc.

4:15am  Back from skateboarding, sweaty, but not exhausted, I shower.  Effects seem lesser now Im at a +/- (Im not sure if Im affected anymore) Im having company over tomorrow, so I decide to clean up the house.

If I ever try this again, it will be at a minimum of 1.5mg.

5:45am Bedtime, I just ate a bowl of soup and got super tired.  I havent eaten much at all today.
