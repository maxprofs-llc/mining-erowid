I have taken doxepin on a number of occasions, usually in the 10-30mg range. It seems to be a relatively safe tricyclic antidepressant, compared to other TCA's, and wiki states that it has low abuse potential (citing 'polytoxicomania' as one of the only reasons for its abuse).

I have found this to be somewhat true, as I may be a polytoxicomaniac by definition, but in that regard I view this as a very promising substance. It provides a slight sedation and feeling reminiscent of benzodiazepines, and I remember thinking that it would mix well with a benzo. I've yet to try this, so I can't recommend anyone else do so, but I thought I'd share my experience just in case.</bodytext></report>
