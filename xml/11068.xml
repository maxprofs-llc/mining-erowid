There wasn't really much to do after school on Tuesday, so I decided to get some friends together and take some ludes they were up for it. The pills we took were marked 'LEMMON 714'. I got them from some guy that had like 500 of 'em. We each took a shot of 99 Bananas and I took out the pills.

[Erowid note: Quaalude Lemmon 714's were last produced in 1982.  In the 1990's, underground knock-off products were produced and sold bearing the same marking.  These counterfeits when seized and tested by law enforcement agencies were found to contain various benzodiazepines, but no quaaludes.]

We started around 3:20 or so. P took one, then C, followed by yours truly. We were going to wait for the effects to kick in while drinking some beers. I got my supply out, and we drank 2. Nothing really happened, until P and I went outside to smoke a cigarette. The feeling couldn't be compared to anything it was like we were a little drunker. It was like the 2 beers we drank felt like 3. I was feeling something. Like the feeling that was inside of me was ready to be unleashed by more alcohol. We went back inside and just started downing more beers. After about half an hour, P and J went to get some weed (goodness). I stayed back with C and drank more. I think I drank 3 more and took another shot. That is when C and I noticed that something was different we were wasted. I got up for a moment to go put on some music and realized that my legs were going numb. C didn't even want to stand up to find out how it felt.

After about another half an hour, P and J came back with goodness. P broke it up and rolled it into a blunt. Mom doesn't really want me smoking in the house, so we all went out back by the gazebo. Roll, roll, roll your joint, twist it at the end. Take a puff, that's enough. Pass it to a friend. Following that, I was really messed up. I only smoke weed as a side dish to other drugs, and that did it for me. The cigarette after everything really set me on my way. The top of my head started to tingle.

Looking back at what happened, I think that ludes only make you feel drunker. It's nothing special. I admit that I didn't mind the taste of the alcohol that much as I normally do. In addition to that, there might have been some slight euphoria. I was feeling pretty good it made me feel cooler, like I knew what I was doing, and the weed didn't make me that paranoid. When my friends left, I passed out (around 8pm). Next thing I knew my mom woke me up at 1am and told me that I have to go sleep upstairs in my bed since I had school the next day.  Past that, everything is a blur. I can't remember how I got upstairs. I can't remember how I remembered to set the alarm clock to wake me up later that day nothing.

The alarm woke me up at 6:10. I got up and didn't know what the hell was going on. I didn't feel like taking a shower. I was really hungry tho, so I went downstairs and had some snack food. Then I went back upstairs and got ready (skipping the shower part). Throughout the whole day in school I couldn't even keep my balance. I was stumbling like I was still drunk, and felt extremely tired. After 5th period (lunch), I felt a lot better. I finally woke up and was able to function properly.

In conclusion, ludes are fucking great. Smoking weed with helps.

/n   Tests have proven most of the 'Lemmon 714' being around to be fakes. They just do contain powdered benzodiazepine pills that were repressed to look like Quaaludes. In the moment (2001/2002) though there are pills around that come from Canada which are said to contain real methaqualone, they are however still not real Quaaludes but pills produced by underground chemists and styled like Ludes   /n
