Back a long while ago I was a bed-wetter. In the fourth grade I had to go on a field trip and so my parents had me go to the doctor to get Vasopressin in the form of a nasal spray.

It worked well as I remember. Except that is the cool part. I remember so much from that night and the few days after. I remember things that were carved in the wood of the bunk bed. I remember some kid fell out of a top bunk. Some other kid named Robbie started hallucinating little cars driving on his bed they called his parents and sent him home. Turns out he had scarlet fever. I remember everything I did the following day.

Anyways, why do I remember such detail? This drug works, that is why. Btw I am twenty now and do not remember such great detail about most of my childhood.</bodytext></report>
