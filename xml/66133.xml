This is an honest detailed report of my date with that hot piece of ass Datura.

After looking all over the net for locations of Datura in my town and finding nothing, I turned to Ebay and found exactly what I was looking for. It was really cheap too! Today is the day after my 'trip' and I am slowly recovering from Datura's grasp. I tried to keep a detailed log of my experience, but towards the end of the log it becomes quite unreadable.

5:00pm - I Have made the tea mixed with Lipton's tea and am going to gulp it down as fast as possible. Note: It tastes just like Lipton tea but my gag reflexes are trying to prevent ingestion. I find this a little odd considering I like Lipton's tea. I feel a little anxious and scared at the same time.

6:00pm - Physical intoxication (not like alcohol, more like taking 10 hydrocodones at once) accompanied by heavy limbs and a slight blur of vision. My face feels like its heavy and I am noticing that I have to make a better effort to speak so people can hear me clearly. I am starting to feel the need to smoke cigarrettes more often than usual. I'm not exibiting any signs of cotton mouth or disorientation. Decided to watch a movie.

8:00pm -   Mildly disoriented . Forgot to post an entry for 7pm because I became so ingrossed in wandering the house and smoking every 15 minutes. At this point, I can barely read what I am entering here in the log. I feel euphoric and my limbs grow heavier by the hour. I constantly feel as though I have something in my hands which are empty.

8:43pm - No halucinations yet I feel like I'm being watched. Aditory hallucinations have started and are creeping me the fuck out! I am hearing babies crying and other sounds that I can't make out. feeling really disappointed that I'm not visually hallucinating.

8:57pm - Can't pee anymore. I'm seeing flashes of light outside in the dark and the voices have gotten louder. I'm also starting to see lots of bugs but they dissapear when I reach for them. I went to roll a cigarrette then left the paper in the can and decided to have a pre-rolled cigarrette. The next morning I would find that the paper I was going to use for the rolled cigarette was a figment of my imagination.

9:30pm - I am feeling weird tremor-like sensations all over my body. I feel kind of sick to my stomach, but not enough to even classify it as a stomach ache. Going to go have a cigarrette. Waves of confusion wash over me about every five minutes. Feeling lonely and bored as fuck.

This is where the log becomes litterally unreadable. There is a significant time gap between my last recorded cigarrette and the time the clock said when I decided to goto sleep. After my last smoke I came in and the clock read 4:00am which makes me worry about what I was doing in that time gap considering I went out for that cigarrette at 9:30pm. I don't remember anything until 4:00am that morning when I found myself getting ready for bed. I thought I saw some Datura seeds on the floor so I decided to pick them up but it turned out to be so hard I gave up. Note: Never once did I see my cigarette vanish or disintegrate in my hands, nor did my speech become completely inaudiable.

I tried my hardest to fall asleep but I had a very hard time getting comfortable. Each time I was about to sleep my sister who never really did this kept coming into my room and asking me questions. I would answer with a what due to my fan being so loud it was hard to make out word for word what she was saying. I would also wake to find millions of ants crawling all over my body and I would just brush them away and continue to try to sleep. I forgot that I was in my own room and believed that I took my fan into the living room and slept out there.

When I actually got up for the day I felt fine but my eyes were still dialated and anything moving in front of me had tracers. I am starting to have memories of what happened in the time gap but only glimpses that don't make sense.

I didn't enjoy Datura as much as I thought. I was disappointed because I felt trapped in my own world, my everyday life. There were no science fiction themed hallucinations, no crazy off the wall happenings, It was just me alone and bored.

Not even the voices could change that feeling, nor could the Datura-fabricated conversations I had with my sister. I can't envision myself ingesting Datura again, but it would be interesting to me on a scientific level to watch others ingest and observe them from a sober point of view.</bodytext></report>
