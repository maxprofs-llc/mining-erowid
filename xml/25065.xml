I had done research on Morning Glory and I was very intrested from reading different experiences. I dont usually like drugs, but I had trouble finding any negative affects of this drug. So my best friend n his buddie order some untreated seeds online. I showed up at my friends house and we soon after left to go to his friends. My friend will be reffered to as celt1c and his friend will be referred to as super K. We went to super k's basement which was very drafty. He had a pc and a tv with PS2. I chewed up over 200 seeds, and sipped some cherry coke every once in a while to help them go down. They tasted very much like sunflower seeds at first, but the good taste started to get weaker as I ate more and more.

We then played GTA3 and counter strike for 2 hours. My friends told me I'd have to smoke some weed to trigger the LSA. I knew this was probably untrue, but I figured it would help make the trip more worthwhile. I dont like pot, but I saw this as an exception. The second we get out of our chairs, we all felt the insane cramping in out calves and knees. At least we knew it was doing something. We walked to his friend easy e's house. He packed a bubbler and we smoked some weed. As we walked up the stairs and out the back door, it felt as if I had passed out and awoken again. We walked through his yard, I looked at my feet, looked at the trees, at his vine covered metal fence, put my hand on the fence and looked down at my feet again, when I looked back up we were back at his back door walking towards the fence, and this looped at least 5 times.

I kept asking myself what was going on. I didnt understand why I couldnt go forward in time. I started to panic since I couldnt remember what real life was like. I was asking myself is this all there is to life? after some looping I noticed that if I kept intaking new information (looking around, moving) I could move forward in time. As long as I didnt think about it. But I couldnt help it! I would be walking through the grass and my mind would wander and suddenly Im stuck back in the vicious cycle. I was always questioning whether or not I existed. Was I a spirit? I wasnt able to control my actions as much, and I was more spiritual and in my head talking and watching myself walking through the grass. My vision started to strobe. I was seeing every other frame.

I looked around and realized I was straying away from my friends. They sort of laughed at me because I was tripping more than them. The reason I was experiencing a wilder trip than them was probably because I am skinny for my size(I'm 6'4' and weigh 146). Next thing I know we are back at super K's house sitting in the basement. It was like I had awoken from passing out again, I looked around myself and my vision was strobing. I remember I was looking at my pants and my arms, and I got stuck in the cycle. We were listening to Hive. This is the best tripping music. Every note of the song seemed to correspond to my every thought. I grabbed a piece of paper and started to write because I needed to keep my mind occupied to not get stuck in the loop cycle. I kept seeing myself going insane and in a mental institution because I couldnt get out of the cycle. The stuff I wrote filled up the whole paper. I wrote at all sorts of angles. I had to start chewing on the end of the pen and playing with it near my face in order to get a grasp of reality. Having the pen in my mouth gave me a sense of reality. It reminded me that I actually existed in some physical form.

The whole loop cycle was like a vortex. If youve ever pointed a camera at the tv, and seen the image loop on for an eternity, thats what I would see as a transition from the end of a scene back to the beginning. I would see super k sitting at the computer sipping on a taco bell drink, and the suddenly multiply and become smaller as he drifted off into a vortex and spiral away. And suddenly Im back to the second before when Im staring at super k. Since the taco bell drink cup was so vividly colored (blue and white) it caught my attention and I kept staring at it and looping into it. I formed a severe hatred towards taco bell for getting me stuck in the time loop. I took my pen and wanted to write more but I ran out of paper. I wanted to write on the armrest, but realized it was a bad idea. When 'Flat Beat' by Mr Oize came on, I imagined myself writing on the wall to the beat of the music and the puppet from the music video dacing in the background. Instead I wrote on my hand. I wrote on my palm in big letters: 'I AM STUCK. TACO BELL MUST DIE!!'

As far as the looping went, the music playing in the background (Hive) wouldnt loop. It continued as normal while I was reliving the same 7 seconds for minutes. I had to go to the bathroom, and when I got up my leg cramps were back. I walked over to the bathroom and when I closed the door I contemplated whether or not I should lock the door. I must have stood for a few minutes, thinking if I locked it and something bad happened, my friends wouldnt be able to get it. As I looked at the lock my vision zoomed in on the lock and I could see my friends knocking on the door and asking if I was okay. I came to the conclusion that locking the door was a bad idea. As soon as I pulled down my pants I got stuck in the piss cycle. Luckily this only lasted a little bit. I looked at my eyes in the mirror and they were very dilated. When I walked back out I sat in the chair that was in front of the one I was sitting in originally. When I sat down I looked around and felt like I was hit by a surge of energy, as if something passed through my body. I looked around and I thought that my chair had shifted. I looked around amazed.

Listening to the music, a song came on that sounded gloomy and depressing. Hatefilled even (sci-clone by Hive). I stared at the friend that wasnt tripping that had provided the weed. He was simply staring at the computer and smiling. He wasnt moving. I started to form a hatred towards him and his stillness. The hostile thoughts were fueled by the music. Soon he decided he had to go home, and I watched him as he walked up the stairs in strobe vision. It was around this time that 'Ultrasonic Sound' by Hive came on. The music was exhilirating. Super k turned on a full screen visual on the computer, and we all sat in our chairs amazed at it. I clutched at my armrests and looked from screen to friend. They loooked back at me grinning because they were feeling the music like I was.

I clenched my teeth, gripping the wooded armrests and stared off at the visual. I could feel wind blowing from the screen. This wind was cold and it was blowing in our faces. I could see super k's hair swaying in this wind that the intense visual was creating. I dove back into the time warp/loop. But now I was so weak from thinking, that I gave up. I said to myself 'Thats it! I can't take it anymore, I give up, the cycle has me. I will just surrender to it and sit here for the rest of my life watching this intense visual listening to Hive with two other peers'.

Eventually a Bob Marley song came on. Im not a fan of Bob Marley, but I was connecting with the lyrics to the point where I was writing more stuff on my paper, and in the background I saw a Jamaican sunset and an image of Bob Marley smiling. I knew exactly what he was talking about when he sang of his Jamaican village, although I know nothing of Jamaica. I even wrote on my paper: 'Am I Jamaican?'. I asked them to turn off the Marley, and turn back on the trance. Instead they turned on the withdrawal song from Trainspotting. The music that plays when he sees the baby crawling up the wall.

I started to loop again, because I was thinking about how heroin must feel. I was envisioning myself in the movie instead of the main character lying in bed. It freaked me out even more and the paranoia reached the point where I thought I couldnt control my actions anymore and I was simply watching myself continue my life. I thought that if I continued to watch this, that I would see myself getting driven off in an ambulance and my father towering over my in the hospital bed.

I needed to go to the bathroom again. 'I need to take a piss' I say, super k stands up, 'Uh yeah, the bathroom is over there' and point in the direction, 'I know where the bathroom is, Ive been there before it's that idk if Ill make it' I say. I made it over there and took a whizz. When I came back told them we need to go outside because I was too cold and might vomit. We walked outside and sat at a wooded table. Suddenly our surroundings dissapeared and we were sitting at a table in the middle of a completely empty vast area in which the floor was concrete and the desert sun shone brightly. I looked over at super k, who was playing with his thumbs and a small bug scurried near his hands. He seemed to be content. I glanced at celt1c, he was staring off into space and his lazy eye was kicking in.

Suddenly a small green see through bug caught my eye as he crawled up the tables umbrella. I watched it closely, but not physically closely, my vision zoomed in on it. Suddenly another small black bug with a red cross on its back scurried accross the table. It had a head as big as its body and its face was humanlike. I raised my hand high in the air, and lowered it with force as I crushed the insect with my thumb. For a second I felt godlike. That creature's life was in my hands, and I had decided it was unfit to continue its pointless life.

Me and celt1c decided it was time to head back to his house. As we walked I got stuck in a cycle of my and celt1c walking down a neverending desert road with no surroundings. We walked past a playground and I ended up looping that experience at least 5 times. We continued towards his house, when I noticed a can on the ground. I didnt want to go home because everyone was home and my eyes were dilated and I was tripping still. I said to celt1c, 'Lets go home later, everyone is there now' and I kicked the can. The can slid on the ground and produced an extremely loud scratching/squealing noise similar to the noises in The Ring and Requiem For a Dream. We went home and my eyes stayed dilated until around 4am when I went to sleep. I was still getting into the whole time vortex when we were sitting around, but it was much much easier to get out of them.

The next morning I awoke noticing things I never looked at before. Patterns, shapes, etc. I stared at a coca cola box for about 50 minutes noting the curves in the letters and the arrangement of the dots in the designs. The trip was by far the scariest experience in my life, but Im very thankful I did it I would do it again.</bodytext></report>
