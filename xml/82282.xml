Over the last couple of months I have been reading various reports and experiences to find a 'legal high' that is a good enhancement for a night out with the lads. I couldnt really find out what i wanted so I decided to buy samples of each of the above and do my own testing with friends.
/n
/n
All males of various ages and weights (weight did not seem to have any differering effects) each taken along with about 6 pints of beer to start with.
/n
/n
Mephedrone - 80mg sample - nice feelings arrive after 25 mins and last around 5 hours, small amount of dry mouth
/n
150-200mg - more intense but had to stop drinking and went on the water after 90 mins, no trouble sleeping.
/n
/n
Methylone - 150mg same type of feeling as Mephedrone but speedier
/n
had very light sleep after and raging headache in morning.
/n
/n
MDPV - 20mg very small dose required felt really mellow and this was probably the best so far but this was ruined by the impossibility to sleep. this lasted 10 hrs and i would not like to try this one again, other people also said they could not sleep all night and got up and felt rough all day.
/n
/n
Butylone - 100mg again very similar to Mephedrone but my brain felt like it was shrivelling up
/n
/n
What will I be ordering now? Mephedrone!
/n
/n
If I wanted a mild &amp; mellow enhancement to a night out I would use around 80mg-100mg if I wanted a more raging night I'd have 150-200mg and start looking a bit strange with the staring eyes and gurning mouth.</bodytext></report>
