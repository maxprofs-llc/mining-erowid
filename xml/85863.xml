I've been looking for a good opiate substitute, and tried 900 mg neurontin with 30 mg pure dxm in coughgels.  That isn't a whole lot of either drug (both are well within therapeutic levels) but it produces a very nice high, tho the onset is really slow, up to two hours.  It seems to last quite some time...if taken in the evening I seem to still have a 'glow' in the morning from it. I'm going to experiment with upping the dxm and lowering the neurontin (600 mg neurontin and 45 mg dxm), just to see if there's much difference.</bodytext></report>
