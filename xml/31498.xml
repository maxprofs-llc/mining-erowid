This is just a short exposistory on my experiences into the mind expanding realm of enthogens. Its worth noting that going into this experience I was attempting to quit meth so that most likley played a large part in the images and mindset of myself during this experience. It all started on a dark September night with my two best friends A and S, they were preparing to do some MDMA themselves that night they had aquired from a seperate source well I was planning on a very introverted experience through the MDMA and Psilocybin.

The experience started off like any other typical MDMA experience for me with the usual tingles and oversensitivity of my body, at which point I injested the mushrooms. Upon the mushrooms hitting me a strange organic quality came about on everything, eveything I touched and looked at felt as if it was made of the same flesh and blood I was. It pulsed as my heart plused, breathed as I breathed, I felt as if I held merged with the planet and we had become one. In this state of extreme oneness for lack of a better word, S suggested we should continue further into the park and go sit by the drum circle that was going on this night, Me and A deemed this an excelent idea and followed her to the site.

At this point time become completely irrelevent to me. What was normally a long dull walk become a blink of an eye. To me it was if I never had walked there, I was already there as the world was. Upon arriving we layed down by the circle and I was forced to close my eyes by a sudden vast gravitonal pull. What I saw changed my forever. It was if I was inside a sphere lined with geometric patterns containg all varietys of pinks, reds and whites. But most importantly I saw my Anima, my very soul floating inside of this sphere, constantly eating and yet at the same time giving birth to itself. It was in a constant struggle against itself. It appeared as a crystaline beast, spraying all the colours of the universe from its body and yet at the same time vapourizing into a white gas.

It was at this point it made sense, meth was killing me. My own soul was ripping itself apart due to my vast abuse with meth, I was watching it disappear into thin air right in front of me and I could do nothing to stop it. I layed in this trance for who knows have long, but upon leaving it I felt as If I had been witness to some knowledge my unconicouness had been trying to pass onto me for eons and was finally able to due to my state of mind. I felt disgusted and just synthetic all of a sudden in contrast to the sheer organic and oneness I had experienced earlier. If I didn't stop meth now I never would and It would be the death of me as a human.

The rest of my trip was merely one of contemplation on the images my own mind had presented to me as a lesson. I feel that even though I might have learned of this at a later date my mind realized I had to know now and guided me in a way to achive this end. Wether I will stay off meth or not is a matter only time can tell, but I hope I will have the willpower to.</bodytext></report>
