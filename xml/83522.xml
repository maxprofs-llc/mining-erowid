Well I've been smoking Serenity Now for like a half a year because of substance abuse classes that are court ordered. Well its just as good as marijuana but you get a tolerance quick to the stuff. Don't get me wrong I love the stuff, good head and body high and it doesn't show up in a drug test. I wonder how long it will be until it is made illegal.</bodytext></report>
