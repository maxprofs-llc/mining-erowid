Used mixture: 35mg of 4-AcO-DALT and a hint of citric acid, dissolved in saline solution. Set &amp; Setting: Alone in a studio with some low lights and soft trance music. Interested in the substance, emotionally a bit shaken, but well, physically healthy.

(with ~15-20mg IV) The effects are very close to mushrooms, but it's like somebody pushed fast forward - while I was still injecting, the world already washed away in a blurry wave of color and light, hence the inaccurate dosage report. Reached ++ instantly, then went up to +++ for a few minutes. Everything was over within less than an hour but there's a distinct 'shroomy' feeling from start to finish - I could swear I even had the taste in my mouth.

Felt very primitive and animalistic for a while, but no mushroom-like 'earth connection'. Wandered through the hallways, everything appeared like a futuristic ruin/dungeon setting, and I had a strong urge to rip my clothes off, throw stuff around and stare into a fire. Resisted said urges.  This was the first time I iv'd a tryptamine, so maybe that high-speed effect came from the ROA rather than the substance itself - I really should read up on this :)

(with ~15-20mg IV, T+01:30) Slight visual, but pronounced mental effects, started coughing and retching heavily after a minute, was pretty sure that I was about to die, in a relaxed, matter-of-fact kind of way. Made it out of this through some mental exercises. Resdosing was not a good idea -  I'm left with a 'dark' afterglow and a slight headache.

What a peculiar substance. I'd love to try this again in a few weeks, with a higher starting dose and no redosing next time.</bodytext></report>
