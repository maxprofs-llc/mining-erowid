I work for a packaging company recently hired by [brand name deleted] to package their smoking blend. We were told that it was all herbal, and that no protective masks were needed. Since prolonged exposure to JWH I have experienced terrifying symptoms. I have been evaluated by approx. 5 doctors including a neurologist, cardiologist, and psychiatrist. the compound known as JWH-018 / JWH-024 are the only possible connections they can find. I had never been admitted to the hospital before exposure to JWH and whatever else they put in their product... in fact these are my first serious health problems in over 10 years. I have had 2 CT scans and 1 MRI that showed no masses in my brain that would cause these symptoms. I have low blood pressure and am considered low-risk for heart attack or stroke.

When I have smoked weed after these episodes, I have had what felt like a severe allergic reaction with difficulty breathing and blurred vision. Keep in mind that before exposure to JWH I smoked weed with all good reactions.</bodytext></report>
