I have taken E several times in the past two years.  I have enjoyed most of my experiences although they seem to be getting more uncomfortable.  The amount of time that I stay up does not seem to last as long or effect me as much spiritually as in the past and the feeling of complete discontent and lethargy at the moment I fall seems to impact me more.

I am not sure why this is happening. My main problem is the uncontrollable urge to do it again.  I know that I will not enjoy it as much as I want but I can't seem to stop thinking about it.

People say over and over again that it is not addictive but then what is it that I am feeling?  I also have the problem of realizing that all that I had realized during my trip was drug induced and meaningless.  I dont want to feel that way.  My first time, I thought that all I was talking and thinking about was real, just harder for me to say and feel when I was sobber.  Lately when I am high I dont even want to talk because I feel that it is all bull.  I want to do E again I just want the experience to be more worth it.</bodytext></report>
