Within the the first three hours after taking the drug,I had some interesting experiences with my eyes closed, abstract imagery and linguisticly hard to define concepts; It all had a dark and negative feeling to it, heavy is a good word to discribe it.

This are some of the symtoms I experienced:

- The worst headache I have ever experienced.
/n
- Comfusion, like daydream nightmares.

- Heat waves all over my body.

- Nausea and vomit.

- Fever.

I learned an important lesson, everybody is different and so are their reactions to a drug.
