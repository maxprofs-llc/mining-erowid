I have used Darvon many times, the first being the best, so I'll share it with you.

It was early afternoon, around 1:00, when my older brother asked me if I wanted to take some darvon with him. I didn't know what it was so I was sorta cautious about it. He told me it was a pain killer similar to Vicodin. I, being a very big fan of hydrocodone (vicodin), took his offer on the darvon. There was nothing to drink so I had to build up the saliva to get it down. We decided to go walking around town for a while having enjoyable conversations about psychedelics and where the best place in town to trip would be, so we did some exploring looking for such a place.

About an hour and a half later we both got hungry and decided to go to the mall to get some food. I noticed that the darvon wasnt hitting me yet and asked him for more. He told me to wait another hour and if nothing happens he would give me another. I agreed to it and we went and bought some pizza. As I was leaving the line to go find a table my stomach started feeling like its was filling up, but I hadn't eaten anything. I told my brother about it and he said it was normal, and that the darvon would take away my appetite, so I quickly tried to get some food in my stomach. I got up to get some napkins, since I forgot them earlier, and right when I reached for them it hit me.

All of a sudden it was like I was 20 feet tall. I couldn't feel my body anymore, and with every step I took I floated higher and higher. It was one of the most enjoyable feelings I've had on any drug. I sat down at our table and tried to eat my pizza. I noticed that I couldn't concentrate worth shit no matter how hard I wanted to. I wanted to tell my brother how good I was feeling but it was like I forgot how to talk, I couldn't move my mouth. After about an hour of eating my slice of pizza, we decided to go walk, or 'fly' around the mall to see what was new. I felt so good it was unbelievable. Absolutely nothing could've bothered me during my 'flight'.

At one point I even started moving my arms up and down in a bookstore because it made me float higher each time, and I'm sure I looked like a complete dumbass to someone else, but It was so cool and felt so good that I couldn't resist. Everything was so beautiful. I was at peace with everything in the world, similar to a good acid trip.

Anyways, the darvon wore off very quickly, about 2 hours after kicking in, and the comedown wasn't bad at all, no side effects, no after effects, just pure 'ecstacy'. I loved it. But to anyone who wants to start using darvon recreationally, be careful; my brother got hooked on them for a while and almost overdosed many many times, and now has an irregular heartbeat.</bodytext></report>
