I hadnt been using psychoactives for more than eight months when I decided that I was ready for my second mushroom journey. I had one other light experience with the sacred fungi a few months before.  I guess I should start with my first trip. It was a fairly cloudy/cool winterish day. I had been looking for some psilocybin mushrooms for a while and had been very close, but failed.

Finally a friend of a friend had been selling a large amount of mushrooms and my friend had told him about me, and he sold me the rest of his suppily (I think it was one and a half eighths). My friend gave them to me in the morning at school and I couldnt wait. I wasnt sure what I was instore for. At 6th period(we have 8 per day) I consumed the mushrooms, all of them. The next period(40 minutes later) the grain on the teachers desk started to move, like a conveyer belt. Thats all I noticed.

The next period I felt very excited, Im not quite sure what I was excited about. luckily we had a substitute teacher. I was drawing through the whole period and Im not a very good artist, but I noticed my errors and I had much more control when I was DUI(drawing under the influience..heh..) so the sub asked me to pass out papers and I tried so so so hard, but I just couldnt keep my mind on passing them out. Its like I had much more important things to think about(life, death, my faults, god).

On the bus home I noticed my pants shifting like waves in the ocean. Once I was home I was very cold and excited. I put in a cd and listened to 'the pixies - where is my mind' and if youve never heard it, its good. After about an hour and a half being home I started to get VERY depressed. I was crying like crazy. I thought I had an intence trip, boy was I wrong. I guess that they had a very small amount of Psilocybin in them.

Last monday I had planed on staying after school and watching my girlfriends(lets call her C) softball game(it was our one year anniversary) and smoking some cannabis afterward. Well last period my friend had told me that he could get me shrooms on short notice and I asked 'how short?' and he said 'how ever long it takes me to reach into my pocket' he showed me two small(about 2.5' circumference)pieces of chocolate and said that they were each 1/16 oz of 'shroom extract' he said that he boiled the mushrooms down then added them to melted chocolate. I didnt believe him and I told him that Id pay him($20ea) after they worked. He agreed and gave them to me.

I waited for her game to end and we consumed one chocolate each. We decided to walk along the train tracks and smoke a blunt that I had. The marijuana wasnt very good, we both got a little buzzed. We were climbing up a very steep hill covered in leaves when I noticed I felt like I was climbing a mountain and it felt as if it had been hours. Once we got back on the street we decided to go back to the school to take the sports bus home.  We were very giggily and we couldnt controll ourselves. Then it hit me.

I had just woken up for the first time in my life. I had been asleep forever and then I suddenly became aware of reality. I looked at C(who is extremely beautiful) and her eyes began to move, the left one went up and the right one went down, then vice versa. We walked around campus for a while then we ran into some teachers. I got scared and started to panic, but C calmed me down. We sat on the steps and looked at the sky and listened to the birds and the fountain in the pond at the front of our school(its an agricultural school so its very nature-ish).
/n
/n
The sky turned into a rainbow of moving colors and the birds stood out more than anything. We decided to go back into the main building because we were getting cold. When I was talking to C it sounded like nonsense to me, but she understood it.  About two seconds after everything I said it would repeat, except it sounded like it was through a walkie-talkie.

This starteled me and I was convinced that there were aliens at the school. After a while I got used to it and I was curious about seeing the 'aliens'. Every teacher that walked by turned into a 7' tall green and pink alien like creature. And every students ears grew long an pointy and they began to look like fairies.

I opened my Gatorade and began to drink it because I was terribly thirsty and I felt as if I as a frog, but not completely, more like a half human half frog creature, maybe it was the way I was sitting. C's parents came and got her(we had found out that the sports bus wasnt coming till 8pm and it was 6pm)i was worried for her because we were still far from reality. I began to get lonley so I tried to talk to some freshmen, but I couldnt tell them that I was tripping. I ended up telling them that C's dad was a bus driver. Not what I wanted to do at all, and it wasnt even true.

So I decided to call one of my smoking buddies. Lets call her B. I talked to her for a bit then my mom came. She was wearing a pink sweater that was, in relity, faded. But it was glowing like a neon sign. I had 'come down' a little bit and was able to talk pretty normal. My mother and I were in the car having the most wonderful conversations about life and I was having amazing visuals. She decided to stop and take me for ice cream and it tasted incredible. I had almost completely come down when we got home.

I was talking, online, with one of my friends about my problems with life. I think that that journey was the best experience of my life. I realized my faults and Ive tried to fix them. My second trip was MUCH more intence than my first. This weeked Im going to write down a list of things to do and take 1/2 of a piece of the magic chocolate, in the woods with a close friend. I plan on focusing on my CEVs(closed eye visuals) focusing on music, writing down my feelings and my new found knowledge drawing and having a meaningful conversation.

Before my second mushroom experience I had been into all sorts of drugs to get 'fucked up'(weed, alcohol, cocaine, dxm, ktamine, nutmeg, mdma, and nitrous) and now I dont have the desire to do any of that. I want to do mushrooms once a month, not to get fucked up, but to become aware of who I am and what my purpose is. Ive been trying to get my hands on some acid because Ive heard that its like mushrooms but different. Im not sure what that means but Id like to find out.</bodytext></report>
