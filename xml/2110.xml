I had tried whippets and liked what i felt. so i purchased a tank, 10lbs and found a place that would fill it with nitrous only and no sulfur dioxide(which is bad news). we tried balloons but i wasnt impressed..we went to kitchen trash bags...oh my god!! Ever hear the word unconscious with your eyes open? Hahaha gotta love this stuff!! Taking deep breaths..light hyperventalating before taking in the nitrous makes the high hit fast. PLEASE lay on your back and do not ever put the bag over your head because you WILL go out....and could possibley asphixiate.
