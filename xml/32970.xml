One of my friend's had recently bought some 10x and I was eager to try it; I was slightly bored of the soap bar we were smoking recently, but it seemed to be the only thing we could get hold of at that time. It didnt provide enough of a high for me, so I thought this would be a welcome change, oh how wrong I was. I didn't have a terrible experience but it wasnt exactly the most pleasent either, it was nothing like I thought it was going to be like, far from the naiv ideas I had in my head.

We went up to a friend's flat to avoid parental interference and the possible chance of having to talk to a friend's parents while under the effects of the salvia. I was glad because I didn't want the added paranoia of being caught hanging over my head. There were 6 of us including me, I was sat against a radiator on the floor. While some prepared the bong I was reminded of a dream I'd had a few week earlier about being in the same flat and sitting on the floor in the same place with all the same people around me. Various things happened in the dream, the outlines of people were distorted; they looked very much like the outlines of people were either drawn in black marker or made of packets of rolling papers, I had the feeling I should have been somewhere else and I fell through the wall behind me. Shaking off the memories of the dream I prepared to take my hit.

I remember lighting the bong and taking a hit, I watched as it burned away and passed it back. I held the smoke in my lungs for about 30 seconds as I was instructed to do by a friend. He told me that holding it in would make the effects last longer and be better. It suddenly felt as if something was rushing up behind me and then everything suddenly went black for a brief second. By this time I was completely under the hold of salvia, my arms were heavy and the room was on its side. I could see piles of packets of rolling papers around me, I grabbed for them but it they seemed to fall through my fingers like sand. The colours of the room had gone and it was like the room had turned cream without me noticing. It suddenly dawned on me that I was dreaming. I totally forgot about salvia and what effect it might have had on me.

I was dreaming again, and all I wanted to do was wake up. I'd lost all sense of reality, convinced I was dreaming. I looked around me, the people in the room seemed to have taken a 2D flat appearance. The outlines of people were made of packets of rolling papers, I could read 'Rizla' on them. The lines across the floor seemed to open up and stretch. I felt like I couldn't move, it was as if my limbs werent attached to my body, more as if they were attached to the lines around the room, when I moved so did the lines and room. It felt like moving would tear the room apart. Movement was becoming an issue, I started to panic because something in my head was telling me I had to wake up soon.

I tried to recreate my dream by falling through the wall, I only managed to hit my head on the radiator extremely hard. My world went white for a few seconds, then all of a sudden it was like I could see myself through the vision of other people. I was looking at myself through their eyes then suddenly I was in my own body again. It felt like my world was spinning and as I watched the people around me move, their faces seemed to distort into cartoon type faces. Someone passed me a joint to smoke, I remember taking one drag in and it felt like I was eating cardboard. I must have put it in the ashtray in front of me because thats where I found it later.

I tried asking the people around me if I was dreaming, all I wanted was someone to tell me I wasn't then everything would be ok. No one seemed to answer me. They actually did but I didn't seem to hear or notice them in their opinion. I started looking for something around the room to tell me I wasn't dreaming but found nothing. Now I was totally convinced I was dreaming.  I was trying to think of where my sleeping body could be, I somehow came to the conclusion that I might be in a car sleeping and my mother was trying to wake me up.

This spurred my panic even more and I stood up, I said 'I have to leave, I have to wake up' and ran out the room. I stopped but don't remember stopping or remember someone calling my name but I turned round and my friend had followed me. By this time it was starting to wear off slightly and I was in a room that wasn't in my dream so that pushed me slightly back to reality, but not much. He walked towards me and I asked 'Are you real?' and touched his arm, this jarred me back into some kind of reality. I could touch something which had seemed impossible before. When I returned to the room my friends were looking at me rather strangely. I was still under the affect of it and there were brief moments where I thought I was still dreaming but would force the thought out of my brain before I started to panic again.

After, when my friends had told me how I had acted, I found it almost scary the way I had lost control of reality so easily. I was also glad that my friend came after me, running into the street asking random people if I was dreaming would not have been good. This experience didn't put me off it, after I had calmed down I tried it again and found the experience much more pleasant, but not as intense.</bodytext></report>
