I just started using X this past February.  Having loved it, I did it every weekend for a month after my initial try.  I started experiencing 'Terrible Tuesdays': mood swings, lethargy, and depression during the week.  My friends (who have been doing X for about three years on a pretty regular basis) clued me in to the fact that if you take 100 mg of 5-HTP daily before bed, the moodiness and depression stops.

5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) is a serotonin booster that you can buy OTC at Walgreens for about $10 a bottle, and it has other benefits as well.  My appetite has been cut in half, and I've lost 20 lbs.  I sleep like a baby because serotonin is one of the building blocks of melatonin, and there have been absolutely no emotional/mental side effects from X since I've started taking it.  Take two before bed on regular nights, and four on nights when you know you'll be rolling the next day.  You'll thank yourself for it.</bodytext></report>
