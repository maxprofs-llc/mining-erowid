Last Thursday night I thought taking one of my old Seroquel pills would help me sleep. I took it at about 7:34 pm. I felt the sedative effects shortly after 8:00. I fell asleep right away.

I woke up at 10:45 pm, feeling like a total lightheaded zombie. I was so terrified. I felt like someone drugged me then killed me. I could hardly stand up. I went back to bed after eating and drinking some water. I was scared I wouldn't wake up but the medication forced me to sleep. At 6:54 am I woke up still feeling drugged but it wasn't as bad as last night. The whole day I felt like complete shit. I learned my lesson. Next time I think I'll just take good old  benadryl if I have trouble sleeping.</bodytext></report>
