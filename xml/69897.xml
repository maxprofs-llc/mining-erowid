My husband, Eric from here on out, and I moved back to our old hometown three months ago.  Since then we have both been very busy establishing ourselves at our new workplaces, and have not really had time to do any drugging beyond the usual Friday night drinking and smoking.  But two weeks ago we got the urge to get hyped up on coke, something we like to do once every 2 months or so.  The few friends we still have here arent users, and after several days of searching we gave up.  Last night Eric decided to take a ride to one of our old haunts in hopes of spotting someone we knew and scoring (this particular haunt was a drug area).  I stayed home to finish some work.  Forty minutes later Eric returned with a baggie, but it was filled with crack rather than coke.

Now, we have dabbled in crack before, with starkly different reactions, neither of which I wish to repeat.  I found the high of crack to be disappointing.  There was immediate euphoria yes, but it was a hazy, chaotic type of euphoria.  Thoughts and emotions were all jumbled, resulting in an odd mix of exhilaration and uneasiness.  And only minutes afterward the downturn began, characterized by restlessness and confusion that was not enjoyable.  All in all I felt it was a waste of good coke.  I had a similar reaction to smoking methamphetamine after having insufflated and injected the substance.  Though smoked methamphetamine has a much more lucid feel, I see clear parallels in terms of a less enjoyable come-up, shorter peak, and more drastic comedown.

My husband on the other hand enjoyed crack a bit too much.  He ended up going on a bit of a binge that scared me and, after he sobered up, him.  Luckily he realized what was happening and stopped.  That was several years ago, but I was still very apprehensive about the idea of him smoking it again.  So when he returned with the crack I insisted we convert it to powder cocaine.

I scanned my favorite website on psychoactives for a conversion method, but saw none.  Knowing that the basic difference between freebase cocaine and cocaine hydrochloride (standard cocaine) was the pH, I decided to experiment.  I placed the $20 rock in a dipping dish (the kind you put olive oil in for dipping bread) and sliced open a lemon.  I gently squeezed the lemon over the dish adding perhaps a dozen drops of lemon juice to the freebase cocaine.  Next I stirred the lemon juice and the crack, using the back of the spoon to break the rock up, until the crack had completely dissolved.  Now I had a milky white puddle of liquid, which I placed in the microwave and heated for 15 seconds to evaporate the water.

When I took the dish out of the microwave I found a very pale yellow paste surrounded by a white powdery substance.  I stirred again and the paste almost instantly turned white and powdery as well.  I assume the yellowish tinge to the paste was the lemon juice since the resulting powder and the crack were both white.  The powder was still a bit sticky, but with the edge of the spoon I was able to scrap it off onto a larger plate for cutting into lines.  By the time the substance was cut into lines it was identical in appearance to mid-grade street cocaine HCL.  The $20 rock made four lines of what I would consider standard size, approximately 1.5 inches long and 10mm thick.

I took the first line, half up each nostril as is my habit.  It did not burn at all, as usual with mid-grade cocaine.  I tend to notice the burn only with high potency cocaine.  Almost instantly I felt an increase in heart rate and respiration, paired with a sense of mental as well as physical stimulation.  I informed Eric that it felt like cocaine HCL and he did his line.  We then went onto the balcony to share a cigarette, and I continued to feel a strongly physical come-up, which slowly settled to the more steady and balanced high that I expect from cocaine.

When we returned to the living room we were both enjoying the high, just discussing our days but in that effusive coked up type way.  After about half an hour I returned to my paperwork since I needed to get it done.  As I would expect on a coke high I found the work more interesting and was able to focus well without the tunnel vision type focus of amphetamines.  Approximately one hour after doing my first line I did half of my second line.  Erics second line was gone though I didnt notice when he did it.  The come-up from this line was similar to the first, more physical then usual but well within the range of response for me to cocaine.  I noticed after a few minutes that my lips felt numb, making talking even more enjoyable.  This often happens to me on coke but usually the numbness starts with the back of my throat and moves out, this time it was only my lips.

After some chit-chat with my husband I completed my paperwork (I only had about 20 minutes of work left) and then we retired to the bedroom.  I gave Eric a long backrub while we continued to talk of life, and eventually the mood turned toward the erotic. It was a very enjoyable love making session.  The cocaine didnt affect sensation much but I was perhaps less inhibited and found, as I often have on cocaine, that my gag reflex was relaxed so I was able to enjoy fellatio more than usual.  I had three orgasms, one during manual stimulation and two during intercourse.  I rarely have trouble orgasming on cocaine.

After my last orgasm I felt totally, completely, blissfully, done.  Eric on the other hand, was having trouble orgasming.  Usually I would make an effort to help him out, but this time I felt too blissed out to care, which lead to a comical finish of me lying motionlessly and Eric waxing off using my butt crack.  I continued to lie there, enjoying the melting into the sheets after-orgasm glow until Eric feel asleep.  I was too up to fall out right away but remained in a less intense version of that blissful state for an hour and then, finally, fell asleep.

I believe the conversion of freebase cocaine to cocaine HCL was successful.  The appearance, effects, and timing were identical to my experiences with street cocaine.  It is important to note that I have never tried to insufflate freebase, and some of the differences in my experiences with crack compared to cocaine are likely a result of the method of administration.  However, I would expect a distinct difference between insufflating freebase and insufflating cocaine HCL.  Therefore I conclude that all or most of the crack was converted into cocaine HCL.

For those that are wondering, I used the other half of my second line as a wake-up in the morning.</bodytext></report>
