I tried this substance a few diferent times. The first time I felt like I left the room I was in and was in a room that I was spinning in, and almost hooked to a string of other people.

I now think of it as me as one tooth in a full zipper and I felt myself pull away from the tooth zipper next to me which was a person. While the whole time I felt these pulses going thoughout my body.  Then in the back ground I seen my family looking at me telling me ' now cant you see the big picture' like my whole life I havent been seeing reality.

Then I slowly came out of it, while feeling strange tingles throughout my body and then had a very calm and zannax like feeling for the next 20 min.</bodytext></report>
