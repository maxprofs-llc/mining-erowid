* main effects
/n
- Main effects of the 4-meo were dying down, but definitely still kicking strong. Within 15 minutes of the 2c-I, I was already seeing neon colored shapes and faces and cartoon characters appear and animate. Once the peak of the 2c-I hit. 45 minutes or so. When this happened WOW. Its like a normal 2c-I trip with a lot more euphoria, and the pixilated psychedelia turned into a neon esque water/bubble paint stream and melts and drips. I remember lying down and the whole room would wobble in many different directions and when it moved everything in the room would have liquid stream of all kinds of colors melting off the corners. The closet doors were shifting into crazy towns and windows and doors. At one point it looked like all my walls were transperent and I was in a space capsule floating through space.

- 10 out of 10... was the most bizarre trip ever besides the DXM plus DMT and DXM plus salvia trips. Those were a lot shorter though. The intensity that was almost overwhelming lasted around 6 hours.</bodytext></report>
