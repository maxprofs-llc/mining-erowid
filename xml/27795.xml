I sat on my couch in the basement, turned the lights on low, put Tear Garden on winamp on the pc, and sat down for a few mins with the loaded bong near by.  After feeling relaxed enough, I took a big hit from the bong, and set it down behind the couch. I closed my eyes, and forgot where I was.

Before I knew it, I existed outdoors in a universe where the natural colors were red, white, green and pink.  I felt like a child again, I was playing outdoors in what seemed to be a front yard, with abnormal colored grass and sky, with a white fence, with a friendly being that seemed female.

After what seemed like a half hour of playing, a stern male being called me to come inside the building that existed in the yard.  I did not want to leave my new friend, or stop playing.  But after a few times calling to me, I felt the need like it was time for me to go see what the male being wanted.

After coming inside the building, it felt like a grocery store, I felt like I had been here before, (maybe on other salvia experiences???).  The being led me to a counter, he got behind it, and pulled down a device for me to select something out of, I was to choose a REALITY to go back into.

I did not want to choose one, I saw what seemed to be the one I came to this strange place from, I felt that my whole 19 years living in it was rather insignificant, seeing that it was just something my brain was just passing time in.

I was busy feeling very un-important, and looking at the other realities that there were, and before I knew it, I was sitting on the couch again.

Now I remembered the grocery store, I visited it many times in past salvia trips.  I had this strange feeling, like I should have my mom try salvia, like it would be a bonding experience. After I straightened otu a little more, I relized how obsurd that idea was.</bodytext></report>
