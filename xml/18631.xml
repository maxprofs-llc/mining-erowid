I am not pysicist and do not claim to be one however, I believe the thoujon to accumulate in your system and after a while it startes to wear on you.  Wormword is said to be a psycoactive.  When I drank Absinthe I felt great increased energy, 'permasmile', euphoria, and very social.  However i also felt nausia and anxiety.

If you believe Absinthe to be a psycoactive wait untill you quit!!  In my experience, the withdraw from Absinthe from someone who has been drinking for a while is utterly horrible.  Sleeplessness, constant fear, clenching of teeth, hullucinations, and if you ever wanted to know how it feels to be completely insane wait till you start having Absinthe withdraws.

I respect Absinthe more than ever now.  I will never touch it ever again. It is one addiction I do not want to have.  Please listen to my warning.
