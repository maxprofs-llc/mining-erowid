I just woke up from a horrible night.

I had bought 300 HBWR seeds direct from hawaii. First time I took 10, and it was great. What I did not know is that there seems to be a long period of tolerance. A friend of mine tried 2 days after, and nothing happened, except getting sick. I tried 2 weeks later thinking that would be long enough.

I decided to try a different method, and instead of eating the seeds straight, I ground them in the coffee grinder and put it in applesauce and swallowed the gunk. I peeled/scraped the seeds very,very throroughly, not only the bark but the white film that covers the whole seed. I peeled 15 of these.

Very soon after ingestion, a few minutes, I felt the dull uncomfortableness in my stomache. When I ate the seeds straight it took much longer for this part, as opposed to grinding them.

I became more aware of my environment. After quite a few hours I saw visual patterns that were barely there, but they were there. I had a body trip and some slight mind wandering but in overall I didnt trip good. I have never been more sick and I vomited 3 or so times. I could not get comfortable in bed and kept squirming and finally passed out.

For anyone who is interested on what the trip is like, the first time when I took 10, was very visual, lots of patterning. I was very creative and my mind wandered all over the place. There is a body trip which is soemwhat uncomfortable. I was very giddy and something would excited me very easily, and excitment created this wave of chills all over my body. Its a nice trip. =)

HBWR is a nice trip if you dont mind vomiting. But there is tolerance. Remember that HBWR is NOT a cheap alternative to psychedelic drugs, it IS a psychedelic. Treat it with respect.</bodytext></report>
