During Cannabis Cup week in Amsterdam.  Alone.

I ate 160 wet grams then went to my hotel room and lay down.  I used my tai chi training in combination with the sacred medicine.  Profound waves of energy began to course thru me. I used my breath to guide the energy through my body, out through the crown of my head and from the tantien, the place behind the navel.  The energy flowed completely unimpeded.  I entered a realm of white ornate mantels.  Intricate patterns of golden energy washed across my body.

As the energy continued to flow the boundary between my body and the universal force evaporated.  It was not that I left my body, but that I had no body.  More intense bursts of energy flowed through me.  With the tai chi practice I was able to guide it as if my hands and feet and belly were flame throwers shooting energy bolts of colors that can not be explained. I no longer needed to remain attached to my particular place in space so I allowed my self to disappear.  Not only my body but what I had previously identified as my mind.  There was no pain or fear anywhere.  As I let go I encountered what I can only call the elders of consciousness, beings of such great intensity and love as to infuse all of reality with their essence.  They informed me with their love.

When I returned I began to explore the organs of my body.  It was as if they had also evaporated.  My muscles and bones and lungs and all were only the energy that was coursing through me.  I felt as if my entire body had gone through a healing as the organ function had been superseded by pure energy.  I was experiencing the eternal and accessing the realm of perfection.  I was connected to all existence with the power and the wisdom it contained.

The experience was profound.  For more than a year now I am not capable of feeling discord.  It is as if my brain has been re-aligned and what I see is beauty and grace.</bodytext></report>
