My last experience with HBW has stalled me in going further with other psychadelics and I wanted an outlet for it, as an introduction I'm male, 22, a student in the UK.

I'm a novice to psychadelics, I've tried Salvia divinorum twice, last summer, both were the oral method.  Nothing much happeneed, I think I swallowed too much 'juice' and possibly did it too late, when I was too tired.  One thing that did stand out was a feeling of uneasyness during that night when any effects that had happened should have worn off.  I found it hard to relax and get to sleep.  I can remember thinking 'why did I do this? I just want to stop and go to sleep now' it wasn't a trip, just a feeling.

I've tried Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds three times, the first was about two weeks before the trip this report is based on.  I'd done 2 nice and easy exams that day and didn't have another one for a week and a half.  At about 7pm I scraped the coating off 3 seeds, chewed them up really well and swallowed them.  Not a lot happened for about 45mins I think but I gradually felt a little different.  I expected and felt the nausea but I also got that same uneasy feeling that I got with Saliva.  I thought 'maybe this is common with psychadelics and it means they're not for me', I was lying on my bed watching TV at this time,  mostly with my eyes closed, the noise from the TV was kinda irritating.

Then there was a knock on my door (I was living in university flats), my flatmate asked me to the pub,  I felt a little giddy but no more than you do when you're tired or just woken up.  I almost went but didn't know what might happen later so declined.   Thought I'd join him if nothing happened.  Flopped back on my bed and then everything changed! The uneasyness turned into a stoned feeling, I was cold so wrapped up in a blanket and sat up against the wall, it was getting a little darker, this and my fairy lights gave the room a nice warm glow.  Almost closing my eyes so I could see just the light from the TV and fairy lights was nice but I didn't see any real visuals or anything, it was just a nice stoned feeling all night.  I couldn't stop grinning...or drooling.  I was totally happy watching crappy TV. My legs were very stiff when walking though but apart from that there were no negative effects by then.  After 11pm I felt like I'd passed through one phase and it was time to turn the lights off.  Fell asleep prolly around midnight and woke up at 4am, was still feeling some effects but I didn't want them anymore, they were more like the uneasyness from before and I just wanted to go to sleep now.  Managed to sleep fine, but woke up the next morning with a massive hangover.  Even so I really thought it had all been worth it, it hadn't taught me anything but it was a nice experience.

My 2nd experience was a no show, I'd decided not to go out the Saturday of that same week and took 3 seeds again.  But I did them too late, after 10pm and fell asleep before noticing anything happening.

The 3rd -- and last --  was a nightmare but has left me feeling it wasn't all pointless.  I'd had 3 pints of lager that day but I'm not sure if that makes any difference, it most probably maded a difference to my last minute choosing to do the seeds.  This time I took 5 seeds, it was about 8:30pm when I swallowed them, I had the nausea but knew it would pass, got the stoned feeling, it was all happening as expected.  Then a friend came round for a cup of tea,  I wished I'd pretended to be out, I did my best to act normal around her but by this time I couldn't stop grinning, luckily she just thought I was drunk and left after a while.

The stoned feeling stayed but it was a little different than the 1st time, pain became interesting, I was pinching myself a lot just for the feeling.  I can't remember when the sickness came back, maybe 3 three hours after taking the seeds but it did and it was a lot worse than at the start.  I was getting some visuals this time, with my eyes closed there were patterns,  lots of red,  green and blue (maybe this is because I do a video course so 'RGB' comes up a lot) but magenta was there as well, lots of strings of DNA like patterns and lines.  I also had excellent photorealistic flashbacks of memories and scenes, I have a good longterm memory anyway but the scenes were crystal clear now and also completely random, I have no idea why certain memories were coming up.  These were interesting but hard to enjoy because I felt so sick and uneasy and my eyes felt like they were twisted and about to burst.  Once when having my eyes tested I had put drops in my eyes to widen the pupil to help them inside more, it felt like that but my eyes weren't actually as big this time.

I couldn't sleep, I was up all night, I was watching whatever was in the VCR at the time to try and get my mind off it.  Getting up felt awful plus my legs really ached.  I couldn't do anything but lay down though sometimes sitting up and moving relieved some of the sickness.  I tried to make myself sick but I'm the world's worst at being sick, it just doesn't happen, I gave up on that quickly.  All night I was tempted to atempt walking to the hospital, I kept trying to convince myself that it would be over eventually and all I had to do was sit it out but thoughts kept creeping back in saying 'this is real, something is happening what if I'm really doing myself some damage here.'  I kept thinking of a story on erowid where a guy had taken hbw and called an ambulance when he felt sick, they just made him sit through it to teach him a lesson.  If I was going to sit through it I was definitely more comfortable in my own room, I doubt I'd have been able to get to the hospital even if I had decided to go. I convinced myself I'd wait until 8am and go down to the health centre.

At around 6am some relief was coming but only slight, I felt a few bursts of 'okayness' and discovered that masturbation helped the feelings, yes I was ready to try anything at that point and it realy did bring some relief.  It was at this point that I believed it really was going to end and that thought made the nausea easier to deal with.  The last time I noticed on the clock was just after 7am.  I then WOKE UP at around 9am, first of all relieved that I'd actually been to sleep and then found most of the sick feeling had gone.  The relief was amazing!.  I think I was able to sleep for a few more hours after that, off and on.

No after effects the next day, I was glad I hadn't gone to hospital or called anyone as I'm sure there would be many consequences to deal with that day.  Since then it has made me feel differently about experimenting with different substances, I don't feel scared to I've just lost the urge that I had before.  The thought of the seeds makes me feel sick, I didn't mind the taste when I did them but now when I think of it I feel sick and sometimes almost gag. It is still only a month since the trip however, I'm sure this will fade.

When I was going through it I thought maybe I was being taught not to take the seeds for granted.  I hadn't gone into it that way but they led me into a false sense of security when they gave me the stoned feeling.  I didn't up the dose to get 'more fucked up' I wanted to see what was there and thought I was ready,  so I don't know.  The day after I felt better for it, like it wasn't all wasted, maybe it was a journy I needed to be taken through.

So would I recommend them?  Well I've had a good and bad trip so either of them could happen to someone else.  Just make sure you know what could happen and be prepared to deal with whatever comes up.</bodytext></report>
