I was prescribed lyria after many years of fruitless searching medical officials for an effective relief for my anxiety. I had previously been prescribed prozac and olanzapine with no helpful results. I am also on subutex for opiate use, which came about due to my anxiety. I can confidently say that lyrica has offered help rendered effective only by benzodiazapines before, and benzos are only effective for a week or two. Anyway, lyrica has offered me a new lease of life, I am now almost anxiety free, and I was CHRONICLY afflicted by this mental disease. God bless this wonderful drug.</bodytext></report>
