I had just received 100mgs of pure jwh-018 from an online vendor today. The substance is a fine-grain fluffy white powder, it almost looks like waxy baby powder. I placed the powder onto a magazine and divided it up into 5 20mg piles. I chose to take a large dose, as I am in a safe environment, and I want to experience the drug's full effect. The normal dose is 2-5mg smoked.

I have already experienced all of the herbal blends you may find in any tobacco shop, such as the k3 improved blend. I decided to drop the stuff and try out jwh-018 in its pure form. It is very inexpensive ($10 100mg, $35 1g) compared to what you will pay for the $10 1g blends at a retailer. Smoking incense to get a buzz is not very appealing to me, nor can it be healthy.

I began by taking one of the 20mg piles and separating it into two, taking some ash and putting it into my bowl, to keep the powder from sucking through as I smoked. With lighter in hand, I freed my lungs of air, then lit the fluffy white powder and began to inhale. I Held the smoke in for about 20 seconds,(repeated with the other 10mg dose) instantly a slight vibration worked its way down from my head to the rest of my body.

It had felt like I had just smoked 100 blunts of the finest Chronic in 60 seconds. The effects were invigorating, it was an extreme Vicodin-Marijuana like high, with the giddiness of mushrooms. I decided to put on some music to tickle my mind. It's been a while so I chose to play some A Perfect Circle. As every minute passed I only seemed to be peaking more and more. The music was very soothing, it was like I was exploring an artist for the first time again, very intrigued. I had some incense burning as well, my room was lit by the light of my laptop, as I was looking across the room, the smoke was coming to life.

I was amazed! it was forming so many geometrical shapes. I will definitely vouch that this substance has strong hallucinogenic effects at high doses. The extreme hallucinating effects lasted for about 30 minutes of the duration. The come down felt like a moderate Marijuana like high, which lasted roughly the last hour of the experience. Using it in its pure form has to be the best way to dose, with the blends the contents are unknown. I recommend this drug for anyone that is looking for an occasional stress release, or a fun time. Be sure to be in a safe environment while experimenting with this compound.

To sum it all up it was a very enlightening experience, great super stoned buzz, moderate hallucinations at higher doses, no recognizable side effects (Except time dilation), just an all around excellent experience. A good alternative legal high, that is very inexpensive, and easy to obtain from any reputable online vendor. Not something I recommend doing frequently though, because this substance is still untested in humans, and very little is known, as this is still a research chemical.</bodytext></report>
