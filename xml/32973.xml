The first time I did it was actually last Sunday. It was about 9 at night and I had read many trip reports for Dramamine. I was excited because the one experience I had with shrooms was very weak and disappointing, and acid hasnt been seen in my town since forever. Because I didn't know if I had any allergic reactions to the chemical I started off carefully with just two 25mg pills. After a half an hour passed I figured I was safe. So I took 5 more.

Within 30 minutes I was feeling a vague stoned feeling where music kind of goes through me and when I stand up I feel almost a rush. This was the extent of having taken about 7 pills, 175 mg. So I took 5 more, but to no prevail. I was getting a somewhat paranoid feeling after a while so I decided to smoke a bowl of pot. This kind of alleviated the paranoia because I am an experienced pot smoker and it made me realize that this was just a drug. The only 'tripping' I experienced was occasional patterns on the ceiling which is very textured. Occasionally I'd see things go bye me out of the corner of my eyes. Also by this time I felt nauseous.

So finally I said screw it and I took 8 more. I waited an hour, then another half an hour, finally I felt really stoned and massively tired. The experience came to a halt when I decided to sleep it off because it was just wasting my time. The next morning I woke up with a hangover worse than an alcohol-induced hangover. Firstly my mouth was incredibly dry, so I had to drink water asap. My head was pounding so I took advil, my stomach hurt, and my lower back where my kidneys are was incredibly sore. I had to pee a lot during the 'trip' which was scary because bathrooms can get creepy when your on the verge of hallucinating because of the mirrors and small spaces. I felt like my IQ had gone down about 50 points and I still was seeing things out of the corner of my eyes.

The hangover lasted till that night at around 9, and my back, where my kidneys are, was sore until the following Tuesday morning. This is not an experience worth repeating, I thought seeing some exciting hallucinations would be fun, cos I never had an experience like that, but it just resulted in a bad hangover that lasted too long and a sore back for some reason. It wasn't worth it!</bodytext></report>
