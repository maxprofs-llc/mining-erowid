I recently obtained four 25mg librium capsules from a friend. Here's my experience.

/n
t00:00- Three 25mg capsules ingested

t00:15-Feeling of relaxation, chalked off to placebo.
/n
/n
t00:30-More relaxation, my bed feels amazing. Finding it very hard to walk. Not a care in the world. I wanna see how far I can take this so I took a fourth pill equaling 100 mg.
/n
/n
t00:45-Really no effect from the 4th pill. Starting to come down.
/n
/n
t1:00-Normality restored.

Overall this is a great drug for relaxing.</bodytext></report>
