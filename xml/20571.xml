Woke up at 2pm.

/n
/n
(With 4 of my friends)
/n
/n

9:45pm: Setting: Room with candles. 2 big beds on the floor and a kitty cat chilling with us.
/n
/n
Played some Tool on the stereo. We three smoked 5 bowls of regs. only foxy female 100-lbs started tripping, pretty much overwhelmed.
/n
/n
I felt nothing.
/n
/n
10pm: Completely stoned and zoned out. 
/n
/n
Starting to feel jittery and very happy. Not with energy, just in my mood. Everyone (but *only foxy female 100-lbs) is feeling pretty good right now.
/n
/n
Switched music to trance and turned it up. Killed the candles and turned on the blacklight with glow in the dark paint on ceiling.
/n
/n
11pm: I feel like I weigh 5 times more than I do. Im laying sunken on my bed, like a big blob. My body feels excellent. Pretty numb and twitchy. My jaw feels really tired.
/n
/n
Visually blurred out, glowing green paint on ceiling is moving. Visuals of rich texture and bright glow to certain things in the room. 
/n
/n
*Being high as the 5-MeO-DiPT worked into my system was great because it creped up on me nicely while I was stoned.
/n
/n
12am: The foxy is flowing like waves off and on. Everyone is still planted into the bed. Some small talk every once in a while, mostly people checking up each other. Giggles all over the room spreading from one person to another like dropping dominos. 
/n
/n
The trance was very soothing and rideable as we flowed through our frozen dreams. 
/n
/n
Closed eye visuals were incredible. Kaleidoscope of craziness, mostly unimaginable or indescribable.
/n
/n
only foxy female 100-lbs is feeling good now.
/n
/n
Stomach discomfort is beginning to be noticeable.
/n
/n
4am: Coming down nicely. Only a little bit agitated and with some stomach growling.
/n
/n
5am: Finally my mind has stopped spinning and thinking. Sleep.
/n
/n
My overall experience was wonderful. As a psychedelic experience and mind journey I would say I didnt travel that far. The up and down of foxy and the lack of focus, made my thoughts start to develop but never finish. Mentally I ended right were I started. Now I just feel fresh and motivated. During the night I pretty much indulged in my body more than my mind. Focusing on relaxing and feeling things.</bodytext></report>
