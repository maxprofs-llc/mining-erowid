I purchased some Damiana Herb from the spirit shop across the street and it was very cheap. The smoke was very very smooth. The leftover smell much like smoking a shake joint. And the feel is both relaxing and a little mouth watering, but I don't smoke cigarettes normally.

In comparison to pot, its not a replacement, but still a very mellow smoke lots of us are looking for. Price and availability are a plus as well. Overall, I would smoke this again mixed with another relaxant herb maybe like passion flower. And I think some pot mixed in would work really well.</bodytext></report>
