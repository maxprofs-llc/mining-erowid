My brother has been taking add medication for a couple years now and he was prescribed Strattera, so i did a little research and decided to snort one, bad idea, it burns like hell! The effects are similar to cocaine, every couple min. I have the urge to run around and do shit, it has been 30 minutes and my nose is still burning.</bodytext></report>
