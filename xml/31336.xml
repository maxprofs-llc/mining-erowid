My parents perscribed ritalin for me when I was younger, but it gave me stomache aches and made me not hungry.  I tried many other ADD medicines and they all did the same thing so I stopped taking them.  But to make my parents happy, I pretended that I was taking them.  I pocketed them.  My friend was over about a year ago, and I told him how I pocket them and he laughed, and he was talking about how you can snort it and get screwed up.  I snorted the smallest bit of one to make him laugh, but that led to more.  Neither of us had done anything bad, not even a ciggarette back then.  He said he had done it before. He was lieing but I believed him and so we snorted some.  Not even knowing what was safe, he did one thirty mg pill, and I did 4 30 mg's within a half an hour.

At first I was just being a little stupid, but then it kicked in and I was hyper as shit, I would just chase my little brother around.  My friend was really calm, and just watched me.  I wanted to run up the road suddenly, in the middle of winter, saying I wanted to do cartwheels and dumb shit like that.  I even told my little brother what I did, laughing.  He was only 9.  I ran up the road, making people come with me, but they stopped running a while after I did, and I look back, and see them not in back of me, but walking back down the hill.  I started to go back, and became scared of being alone in the dark and cold.  I became paranoid of people coming out of the woods and stuff as if I were a child.  Sadly, one of the scariest moments of my life.

Later, when we were watching a movie trying to go to sleep to it, or I should say my friend was, my arm was shaking.  My friend was asleep not that long after the beginning of the movie, and when the movie ended and the room was dark and I became scared again.  I was up all night laying on my bed, petting my dog to help me from being so damn paranoid.  When morning came my eyes were really really red, and I felt tired but was really awake.  My eyes hurt for the rest of the day until I went to sleep at 4 pm.

This ritalin 'high' led to other things.  I started drinking with friends, then started smoking pot, all of the time, before school every day and in school bathrooms about 2 times a week.  I spent 500 bucks of my confirmation money on it and other stuff.  I have quit pot now, for my parents test me a lot pissed off that I did it (caught me growing it).  I remembered the ritalin high and started doing that again up at the bmx track in my town.  I came back from there once with a mini m and m's container half filled with powder in my pocket, and when my dad saw cigs in my pocket, he pushed me up against the car and searched me.  He found the ritalin, poured it out onto the sidewalk, and called the cops.  My mom took the phone and told the cops to nevermind, luckily.  I convinced my parents I was trying to sell it, and now they act as if it never happened.  I stopped doing ritalin after that for a while.

I started popping different pills recently in school, benzos, antidepressants, whatever people told me would fuck me up, wanting to make it more interesting.  I then started snorting ritalin again.  I do it in class, behind my bookbag when I am coming down.  This has been going on for weeks now. I have old full bottles of genaric ritalin, and many other pretty much full bottles that my mom put in the bathroom closet, stuff from friends, plus the shit my mom gives me in the morning.  I always carry crushed pills wrapped in tin foil with markings of how many mg's are in them, for me and whoever i can find to do it with me.  I do it at home by myself every day.  I snorted some before going on this website today.

I looked up stories of people that do this with ritalin, and find many of them get addicted.  I now know I am addicted, which made me decide to write this and tell people not to get into this if you get addicted to things easily.  My dad is an alcoholic, same with many other family members (uncles and shit).  An addictive personality runs in my blood.  My mom has told me this and warned me many times, but I told her that she was being dumb and to shut up.  I realize that many of the times I snort the ritalin, it isn't even fun for me half the time, it just gives me some strange satisfaction.</bodytext></report>
