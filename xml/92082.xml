Ok, so this is my second my experience with 2C-D (Ive also done 2C-E and 2C-I before). I was going to a concert and by chance a friend who planned to remain sober for the night was driving me into the city. This posed an interesting opportunity to do some drug experimentation. I had dropped a heavy amount of acid just two days earlier but I figured enough time had elapsed to kill any potential cross-tolerance if I tried a 2C. So since I had to work in the morning I picked 2C-D due to its shorter duration. Plus, the first time I tried it I found it extremely fascinating and I have been meaning to come back to it since. Naturally we were running late so I threw 50 mg into a capsule, smoked a bit of weed, downed the capsule and headed out the door around 8:30 PM.

My friend is not as familiar with driving in the hellhole of intestinal labyrinthic streets that is Boston so I actually had to parallel park for him because it was pretty high stress. I was definitely tripping a bit so this was an interesting experience to say the least. /n (I hardly ever get behind a wheel while tripping). Regardless, the band was Taking Back Sunday and so I was not expecting an incredibly violent or overly active crowd, so upon arrival we plopped ourselves into the pit. It was while standing there waiting for TBS to come on stage (we missed all the openers) that I started to fully come up. I started gagging and coughing a bit for no real reason and in fact it wasnt actually that unpleasant but I found the static pit to be unsettling and I decided that I would rather be in the bathroom just in case I got sick. As soon as I left the pit I felt better though. With that one exception the come up was pretty smooth.

This was around T:1:00 that I noticed the typical general change in consciousness as well as mild visuals and stimulation. I was feeling a bit antsy as I walked back to the pit but at exactly that point the band started playing and IMMEDIATELY any discomfort dissipated immediately as the music and lights engulfed me. Dancing was extremely pleasurable but we were in the back and so it wasnt a very tight pit.

There was a banner hanging behind the drummer and the venue was pumping the stage full of smoke so the lights could be visible as beams. Hence I was seeing the hanging fabric through the lens of smoke, which gave the banner a beautiful vibration and enhanced motion a lot. All things considered I had to really look hard to notice visuals in the general sense but I think this was because the venue was so open that it somewhat resembled being outdoors to me. For me visuals are always more intense when indoors. I did notice much more intense colors via lights and venue banners on the balconies. Everything seemed to be of higher saturation and greater contrast. In fact it was quite beautiful.

That said, the bit of 2C energy made me really want to push to the front where a bit of moshing was occurring. Eventually I managed to and it was absolutely wonderful. 2C-D provided enough of an energy rush via the 2C roll and enough of an auditory and visual enhancement that it was perfectly compatible for being pushed around and dancing/jumping all over the place. I had enough energy to go the whole show moshing about as hard as one can at a TBS show. It was extremely fun.

The show ended about five after 11:00 PM and so my friend and I headed out of the venue and walked towards our car. Suddenly now that people and music were not enveloping me I actually began to greatly notice a visual change in my spatial perception. Walking felt great and being in the city was a beautiful experience.

We got in the car and headed home. The drive seemed to take forever because of the time dilation but let me tell you, being driven through a tunnel while tripping is awesome. It feels kind of like launching down the main drop of a roller coaster, or like being a bullet as it travels through a barrel. The tiles of the tunnel pulsated and shot past me.

So we got home around 1:00 AM (we got lost and there was construction and traffic, also known as a normal night in Boston) and I was kind of still tripping but not heavily. I ate some food and then packed a bowl. I smoked most of it and then headed to shower. Suddenly the weed kicked the 2C-D right back into gear and I was full blown tripping again. It always amazes me how weed can do this. I looked at myself in the mirror and noticed more visuals then than I had all evening.

2C-D has completely unique visuals in my opinion. They arent similar to the other 2Cs Ive done, acid, shrooms or any other tryptamine or phenthylamine I have tried. Its hard to explain, but its very subtle and extremely pleasant actually. Its like the line created from high contrast things (like light creating shadows around my muscles) becomes a tool for pulsating. Instead of lines along edges (i.e. the line my arm makes over the wall behind it) moving rapidly like on acid etc the 2C-D seems to gently sway the WHOLE arm as if being viewed through vapor or smoke or even underwater. Its very pleasurable. It also doesnt warp you, in fact I looked pretty much like myself. I even had good self-image, which is something I actually never have while tripping.

So I got in the shower and it was excellent. By this point Im both high and tripping and since showering high is one of my favorite things, tripping only made it more euphoric. For the first time I noticed some fascinating thought spirals and creative linking of thoughts. There was a marked increase in fluidity of thinking and introspection. It was, however, NOT a very heavy mental load. To experience the same equivalence of visuals on acid for example the is far more of a mind fuck. On acid there is clearly and absolutely a change of thought process and things like talking or interacting somehow feel different. For me to feel this way on 2C-D I needed to seek it out, which is why only noticed it in the shower. I actually think I could be incredibly high functioning in day-to-day life at this dose if I could somehow satisfy the roll feeling that accompanies all 2Cs for me.

So I finished the bowl, watched some TV shows on my laptop and went to bed around 2:30. I was definitely still tripping too. The first time I did 2C-D it lasted like 8 hours. It stayed at a low level for a while but it always seems to last a bit longer than the 5 hours that PIHKAL says.

Overall I actually REALLY like 2C-D and plan on using it as my mid-level-intensity (not acoustic, thats for acid but also not a rave, thats for MDMA) concert drug. In fact I think concerts are the right place to use 2Cs and the shorter duration of 2C-D makes it all the more compatible. This drug is nothing but pleasant and beautiful so long as you are active even if youre just running around for a bit. From experience with 2Cs, if you just chill and dont move too much there is a way higher chance of discomfort. Whats more is that you dont necessarily make the connection to be active but once you do, whatever was uncomfortable usually goes away. 2C-D is no different.

I think it has the highest potential to be enjoyable of all the 2Cs Ive done.</bodytext></report>
