Next time you are rolling - try the Kechari Mudra! BAM, instant hit of joyful goodness!

Basically, I take the tip of my tongue, and go up the roof of my mouth, keep going up and up, until I touch the soft palate, then go even behind that, until I start licking my mid-brain area. (Google it for more descriptions, but that's the idea.) Keep it there for at least 30 seconds... and feel an effect within the first 5 seconds.

Whenever I did this during the course of a recent (really high-quality) roll, I immediately started feeling the effects more. While more-or-less peaking (but coming down from the super-peak), it was a nice hit of more-peaking.. kind of like taking a puff from a cigarette. While more-or-less coming down, it brought back a bit of the more-pronounced effects, like visual clarity.

Heck, I can do this while sober, too, though more pronounced effects are likely to be had while on some substance or other.</bodytext></report>
