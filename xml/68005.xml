I am an occasional cocaine user (once a month roughly) and an occasional oxycontin user.  I am not too fond of the 'crash' that comes from cocaine use, so I thought maybe using oxycontin would help assist in the 'coming down'. Over the past several hours I have snorted about a gram of cocaine. I then crushed up and snorted an oxycontin pill which was 30mg about fifteen minutes ago.

I am surprised about how much better I feel than just cocaine alone.  My heart doesn't seem to be beating rapidly, and I feel very calm and relaxed.  I can still feel the effects from the cocaine, as I stopped at the same time as starting the oxycontin.  The 'crash' is not really a crash at all, but more like a whole new high that is beautiful and fulfilling.  I suppose I am a little concerned about what kind of effects that could have on my body negatively, but overall I am really enjoying myself.</bodytext></report>
