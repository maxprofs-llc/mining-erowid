Let me start off by saying that I am the most prone person to bad trips that I know of. I can't take two hits of schwag anymore without thinking I'm going to have a heart attack. Ever since I started having pot induced panic attacks, I have always been intensely aware of my heart rate when on any drug.

I had talked to several people who had tried AMT, and heard nothing but good reports. When my friend (Peter) said his parents would be gone for the weekend, I decided that now was the time to try it out. I bought a gelcap with 50mg of 98.9% pure AMT from another friend of mine, and, since I hadn't heard of anyone as light as me taking the drug, I decided to split it into two doses: one of 10 mg and one of 40mg. Since I had heard that the effects are so long lasting and take so long to kick in, I took the first dose of 10mg at two o'clock between class periods. After school, I met up with my friend and rode with him to his house. I didn't really notice anything at all until about 4:30, when I noticed an inconsistent unsteadiness in my peripheral vision. Untill then, I had just felt kind of excited for no reason. We went to a gas station and met up with some friends at 6:30, which is when I decided to take the remaining 40mg dose.

NOTE: I took this dose with one dose of 5HTP. The dealer I got the AMT from said that it would make me 'have a good trip no matter what'.

At seven o'clock, we were all sitting around at my friend's house watching TV. This is when I had my first actual visual. I went to the miror and noticed that the blinds on the other side of the room were waving ever so slightly. A few minutes later, three more friends of ours (Alberto, Chris, and Jake) called and said that they had just gotten two cases of beer (by throwing money on the counter and speeding off) and that they would be over soon. They had pulled this off a dozen times before and not gotten caught. Everyone else got excited, because until then, I was going to be the only one on any substances. They arrived and everyone, except me, comenced to drink. While they were drinking, I would stare up at the clouds and watch them dance. It was a very windy night and the clouds were being blown very fast. All of the sudden, they changed directions. They started swirling and moving in all these crazy ways. After a few seconds of this, they suddenly blanked the entire sky and stoped moving. But before I had a chance to tell anyone what had happened, they snapped back into focus and repeated the process again. This happened about 8 times before someone else got my attention.

At 8 O'clock is when things started to fall apart around me. I was out in the driveway looking up at the clouds again, when Chris pulled back into the driveway after driving to go get cd's. He said that the gas station that they had gotten the beer from was crawling with cops. We put everyone's car in the back yard in case the cops went looking for any suspicious places, not thinking that there had been cameras that had gotten Chris and Jake's license plates.

At 8:30, I was on on the computer, when I heard Jake say, 'we're caught'. I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. He had just gotten a call on his cell phone from his mom. The sheriff had come to his house and he, Chris, and Alberto had to go meet their parents and the cops at the gas station. Imediately, everyone began to run around like chickens with their heads cut off. We after about 15 minutes of drunken panicking, everyone who was not busted got into Peter's car and we decided to drive to an open all night restaraunt where we hang out a lot. The only problem was that Peter was too drunk to remember where his keys were. The other people in the car began yelling at him. This was more than I could take. I grabbed the more calm of the three and told her to come with me. I had to get away from all of the 'negative vibes' or else I would freak out. We walked across the street to the park and sat and waited to see the car pull out of the driveway. We just sat and talked for about 10 minutes and it was actually very enjoyable in spite of what was going on. When we saw the car pull out of the driveway, we walked back and drove off.

Nothing much went wrong for the rest of the trip. I realized that I could control what I saw. I could talk to people and they would hold still. But if I decided that I wanted them to morph into a dragon, they would do it without question. Peter was about to pass out, so we dropped him off at his house, took all the left over beer, and went to get rid of it. I ended up having to drive around while tripping my face off. I drove around for about 15 minutes before I realized my lights were off. I went back to Peter's house to drop off his car and walk up the street to my house. I sat and had about a two hour long conversation with his little brother and explained what all had happened. He already knew something had happened and I just clarified everything. At about 2 in the morning, I got him to walk me up to my house because the shadows were doing strange things and I didn't want to make the journey by myself. I spent the rest of the trip sitting on my bed and making my curtains dance around the room.

Considering what happened to me, I think it is impossible to have a bad trip on this stuff. At one point, I was the only one with a level head out of the entire group, despite what I was going through. It was by far the best drug I have ever done.</bodytext></report>
