I forget exactly where I heard about the Mucuna Pruriens plant but after a bit of research I found the extract that goes by the name DopaBean.  I purchased a bottle and was excited to try it out.

Over the course of the next week I would have a pill every now again, sometimes with coffee and sometimes without, sometimes with alcohol and sometimes without.  What seemed to be constant was a slight increase in mental agility and alertness.  When combined with caffeine it makes an excellent tool for anything that requires a lot of concentration such as programming.

One night some friends and I were feeling cheeky and we poured 2 pills out and railed a few lines.  It was pretty dry and unpleasant but we all got a little more stoked.  Probably a mild +1.  This could also have been from the excitement of doing something stupid but either way, it was fun.

I probably won't put this in my nose again any time soon but I've ordered two more bottles to help out with work when I need a little bit more than caffeine.</bodytext></report>
