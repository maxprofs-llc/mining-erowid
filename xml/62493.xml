Lately, I have noticed that I have been developing a drinking problem and the thought of causing liver damage became a concern of mine.  I had been drinking heavily for almost a year (5 days a week) with the combination of taking other drugs, mostly of concern is pain killers.  Anyways, I was not feeling like a healthy 21 year old, so I decided to knock off the drinking and buy some Milk Thistle from the internet.

When I began to take this substance, I felt especially good the first day, no aches in my body nor any headaches either.  The only problem I found with this substance was that my feces were runny and burned like hell for the first few days I took it.  It found myself in the bathroom quite a bit with a burning colon.  Now that I have taken all of the pills and quit drinking regularly I feel like a million bucks.</bodytext></report>
