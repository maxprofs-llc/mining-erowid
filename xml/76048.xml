I have a very severe case of insomnia. (2) Ambien 10mg have a very negligible effect on my getting to sleep. There may be a very fleeting feeling that sleep should occur, but it quickly wears off. I wouldn't call it 'sedation,' just a very mild drowsy feeling. In fact, because Ambien's effects are so short-lived, I can drive and do all normal functioning without any impairment. </bodytext></report>
