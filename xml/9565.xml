2C-T-7 has gotten a remarkable amount of bad press lately (not of all it deserved on the basis of available evidence, imho) and I thought I would weigh in with my thoughts on the substance, using as a reference my first (and best) experience with it.  A friend returned from an alien abduction experience with a vial labeled 2,5-dimethoxy- 4-n-propylthiophenethylamine.  Having read Shulgin's comments on this substance in Pihkal, I was eager to try it. (his comments about its 'intrinsic richness and acceptability' piqued my interest)

Six friends and I decided to try it one lazy Saturday afternoon.  We began with 35 milligrams orally.  All but two of us experienced nausea on the way 'up.'  I puked.  At this level we all agreed that the substance in no way lived up to Shulgin's comments on it.  Visuals were occasionally present (mild amount of patterning), and everything looked quite a bit more vivid, but these were the extent of the visual effects.  Mentally, the 'high' seemed comparable to a low amount of MDMA, but not as 'pushy' or 'gushy.'  We all knew that we loved each other, but felt no need to comment on that fact.  We all accepted that we were accepted, and moved on from there.  When it became clear that the effects were not going to build to an uncomfortable level of intensity we went out for a walk to a park, which remains one of my favorite memories of that group of friends.  Everything felt great, but not comparably to 50-100 micrograms of LSD.  Everyone agreed that at this level it was relatively disappointing, though it was enjoyable.

Seven hours into it, five of us decided to ingest some doses intranasally.  Having read comments on the *intense pain* associated with snorting 2C-B, we decided to start out with a five milligram bump (which *was* weighed, quite carefully, on a scale).  We waited a few minutes, and, noting no pain or nausea, decided to go out for another walk.  During the walk everything started becoming much, much more vivid visually, though still with a pronounced lack of any visual 'distortions.'  Also, the body 'high' and mental 'high' became more amphetaminesque.  We were walking quickly, giggling, and talking fast.  It was at this point that we decided to snort our final dose, 15 milligrams each.  (this also weighed carefully)  After we got done we went out into the living room, to talk and wait for 'whatever is going to happen.'  This turned out to be quite a bit.

I remember turning to my friend * and saying, 'You know, this really doesn't hurt at all,' when I suddenly became aware of a increasingly articulated burning sensation on the left side of my face.  From the look on *'s face, I knew he was feeling it too.  My eyes began watering.  Suddenly I felt more nauseous than I ever had in my life (and trust me, I've used a fair amount of DXM) and *ran* to the trashcan and began violently throwing up.  I was soon joined by four of the others (only one of us did not have any nausea this time).  In between horrible sounding pukes, we muttered 'Why do we do this to ourselves?' and other various signs of distress.

About fifteen minutes or so into it the pain began subsiding, and the visual display kicked in.  And MY GOD, it was incredible.  Everything in my visual field began dissolving, with greater and greater rapidity,  into morphing gemoetric shapes, but these were faster, more complex, and more *layered* throughout my visual field than any visual displays I had received with other substances.  THese were not *visions*, not coherent displays with meaning behind them, but simply *visuals*.  (I consider the distinction important)  This felt like the substance was simply proving what it could do to my visual cortex.  I also began to feel more *sped* than I ever had in my life, and I went through a younger, and more foolish period, of using cocaine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate (Ritalin) fairly frequently.  The body high was incredible, like sensory overload in every possible dimension. (this was NOT unpleasant, simply intense) Mentally, I felt much like I had from the 35 miligram oral dose.  I did not note any great increase in the mental effects, other than a tendency for my emotions (WHATEVER they were at the moment) to magnify exponentially.

I stumbled back into my bedroom to lay down next to my fiance (now ex-fiance), who had ONLY taken an oral dose and was now sleeping.  This was just in time, as my entire visual field dissolved into contentless WHITE LIGHT soon after this.  I also began experiencing 'body shakes' of an almost convulsive quality, similar to those described by people taking high oral doses of DOM. I relived several scenes from my childhood, in full color, 3-D and audio, which I found somewhat impressive.  I also was granted a visual representation of the 'strange loops' which make up normal consciousness.  Mentally, I still felt remarkably not high.  (I should note that two friends of mine claim that they developed telepathic communion in this same period, so obviously my reaction isn't the only one possible)

On the way down I spent 30 minutes staring at a clock before I recognized what it was.  I stumbled out to see how everyone else was doing.  All quite satisfied with the results.  THe next day I felt quite washed out physically and mentally, which was alleviated by a cocktail of vitamins and nootropics (though not entirely dispensed with).

Thoughts:
/n
(1) I don't really find 2C-T-7 that interesting.  It seemed to have a notable lack of any introspective or 'spiritual' effects.  It seemed empty.  Fluff.  
/n
(2) The onset of visuals from the last snorted dose makes me quite a bit more interested in smoking nnDMT.
/n
(3) The interesting effects were at the price of severe pain, pain that I don't think I'd care to repeat.  Ever.
/n
(4) As I understand it, snorting may be a fairly risky route. (though I do have some issues with the *multiple* substances Joshua Robbins was on) This substance certainly *felt* as though it could do real damage.
/n
(5) It was interesting, but after two trials with it, I'll stick to other, more spiritually productive substances.  I know a lot of people tend to sneer at DXM use, but DXM, though not as chic as 2C-T-7, has aided me in coming to a number of realizations.  It isn't an issue of 2C-T-7 being a synthetic chemical - it just isn't a very interesting one.</bodytext></report>
