I have been taking Darvon Simple at high doses for the past year.  I obtain them via tijuana pharmacies.  This particiular experience goes like this:  It was a typical Friday night hangin' with the boys.  I popped 6 of the 50 mg pills, this is an extremely high dose, most my friends take two pills and they are flying, but I like to roll hard.

It took about an hour as usual before the effects started to kick in, in that hour I probably had a beer or two.  Once the pills were in full effect I had an overwhelming sense of well being, very sociable and happy in general.  It is similar to vicodin or lortab, which I also am in love with. The feeling was great, no pain whatsoever physical or emotional.  I felt so warm and comfortable it was a beautiful experience.  I stayed up until about 4am.  It was killer.</bodytext></report>
