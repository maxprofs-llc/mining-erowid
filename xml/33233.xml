Well, let me begin by stating that today is the worst day of my entire life.  I consider myself to be an avid smoker in products of the marijuana variety.

The mix of seroquel and marijuana happened to come together by accident.  I have problems of anxiety, and I happened to tell my parents about this who later gave me seroquel.  I didn't think at any point that mixing these two would cause anything serious.  Suffice it to say, I was wrong.

I took the seroquel around 2pm, and began to feel exhausted, by 6pm I was asleep.  By chance my roomate and I happened to be both awake at 415am.  So of course we decided to partake in the festivities of 420 :).  We smoked 2 bowls, and then I felt tired once again and decided it might be a good idea to sleep.  I went to my room, and had the funniest sensation that I couldn't understand.  I had no idea what was going on with anything.  It's not that I had no idea where I was, or who I was, it's that I was completely unaware of any of it.  I sat in front of this very computer, and had a bitter taste in my mouth come on rather suddenly, and an onset of confusion.  The next thing I knew, I was on the floor having a seizure.  I managed to cut my face (minimally, thank god), and cause minor trauma to my back.  I can only remember little bits of the seizure, and my roomate had said it lasted well over 5 minutes.  To sum up the medical side of things, my blood work revealed I have a great nutrition.  I also have no family history of seizures.

I re-iterate, this has been single-handedly the worst day of my life, and I have no intention of repeating it.  According to the doctor, I should wait a minimum of 3 weeks before I smoke anything, and I may have a seizure again at any time, without warning, until the seroquel is completely out of my system.

Given this information, I can't see how anybody would want to mix these two.</bodytext></report>
