The stuff was soaking in rum for about 3 days. The experience from drinking one glass of the beverage combined with water was mildly hallucinogenic for about one hour. Afterwards I was very awake and could not get any sleep, so I took another glass of the same drink and found sleep immediately after drinking it.</bodytext></report>
