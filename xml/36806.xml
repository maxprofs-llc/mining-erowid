I am a very curious person to say the least.  I am a rational, pre-med student at an Ivy League university, with no belief in spiritual or divine realms.  I bought a beginner's package of Salvia from a reputable site to just try it out and see what happens.  This is not to say that I don't have respect for the effects!  Quite the contrary, I am a very spiritual person with atheist beliefs.  I thought Salvia might be an interesting experience given the historical and cultural lore surrounding the wonderful herb.

My first experience with Salvia came on a quiet summer night.  I was alone in my room at 1 a.m. when I decided to venture into the Salvia world.  I turned the lights down low, lit a few tea light candles and packed a tobacco pipe about 3/4 full with leaves and sprinkled some 10x extract on for good measure.  My first series of inhalations produced only minor effects that were probably a result of smoking something really fast.  However, when I re-packed the pipe and went for round 2, I could never have expected what would be in store for me.

Like so many others, I felt instantly boxed in. The best way to describe it is like I was wearing a suit of lead armor.  I could move but a severe gravitational force made me realize my efforts were futile.  I did not see the spirals or flashes of color that have been described here before.

I placed my pipe down and buried my face into my pillow to releave the force of gravity.  Immediately I was lost in another realm.  I saw how everything worked.  It sounds so cliche and nonsensical, but I was privy to knowledge of how reality functioned.  It would be like if right this very second someone lifted the curtains and revealed the stage crew of life.

I went on several 'trips' to unfamiliar and completely new surroundings.  It reminded me of the movie 'It's a Wonderful Life' where the main character observes the world but cannot be seen or heard.  I watched a Brooklyn family pack for their summer vacation.  I met two invisible beings, but not human or even alien in shape.  I could not see them but I knew they were there with me.  They became my tour guides throughout the trip.  I remember floating through my bedroom door and hovering over my own body and watching myself trip on Salvia.  This was definitely the highlight of any Salvia trip I have been on!  It was so fascinating and emotional to see myself.  I cannot adequately explain the beauty of an out-of-body experience, it is something to be desired.

The second most inspiring event took place after the out-of-body experience.  I was laying on my side with my face buried in my pillow when I lost the distinction between the fabric and my skin.  I felt like I was a part of the pillow and my arteries, veins, capillaries etc were all connected to the cotton fibers of the pillow case.  All of a sudden, the pillow morphed into a beautiful old oak tree with amazing knotty roots.  I became one of the roots and felt very warm and connected to the 'everything'.

I have smoked Salvia several times after this experience and have always seen similar effects.  I notice that there are elvish type creatures in my trips.  They remind me of the elves that some people experience when taking Ayahuasca vine...maybe they are related in some respect?

The length of my trip from start to finish was nearly 15 minutes.  I reach climax very early on and sober up very quickly.  For me, there is no down time on the trip, I go from max to min with little in between.  I feel completely sober about 20min after the trip ends.  There is a def. afterglow that must feel like prozac x10!  Some of this sounds like stupid rambling and may come across as false or immature, but Salvia is one eye-opening and powerful plant.  I smoke infrequently, not because I don't enjoy it, but because it cheapens the ritual aspect.  Lady Salvia is a beautiful creature!</bodytext></report>
