Leaving you was just so fucking hard
/n
I cried and I begged, I lied and fell apart
/n
Yet no one trusted me
/n
Only I could see
/n
That you were what I needed
/n
No matter how much I pleaded
/n
I want your touch on my lips and in me
/n
I've never had such fill me like you did
/n
I have to hold my chest and my heart
/n
When you are going through me
/n
Now alone I fell apart
/n
You were my serenity
/n
No one understands our love as a whole
/n
That without you I have no control
/n
And you without me are craved by many
/n
But they just don't see 
/n
That you are mine
/n
And without you, in my eyes there is no shine
/n
Now I just wanna die
/n
Without you by my side
/n
I cannot lie
/n
I feel no pride
/n
I can't go on
/n
I lament your consumption
/n
I mourn because I can't return
/n
My heart and my mind still yearn
/n
Everyone has their presumptions
/n
It is all true
/n
I am addicted to you</bodytext></report>
