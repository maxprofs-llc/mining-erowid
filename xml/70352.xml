I took 5 mg. methadone daily for pain management.  It worked beautifully, but then I had to get off of it, which was sheer hell.

I know it looks like a low dose, but when you're detoxing, it doesn't really matter.  I had massive leg spasms that kept me from sleeping, my whole body was wracked with flu-like pain, I was mentally foggy, and I had really worrisome diarrhea.  Most of the symptoms started subsiding at around 3 weeks after the last dose, although I am still experiencing difficulties with diarrhea close to three months after the last dose.

I've taken myself off of many drugs that I was either addicted to or dependent upon, and I will say that methodone was a beast to conquer.</bodytext></report>
