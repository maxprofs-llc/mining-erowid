I recently ordered some nitrate poppers at an online site since they are legal in the US. I eagerly waited the five days it took for them to come in the mail and then I got the package and immediately opened it up. Inside there was a bottle of Rush liquid incense and 2 small plastic cases of ampules which are small little glass tubes wrapped tight in paper and the idea is to snap the glass and smell the fumes that come out of it - same idea with the bottle only you just open the bottle instead of snapping it.

Anyways I broke one of the ampules and started inhaling, I'm not sure what I was really expecting but I immediately got a head buzzing sensation and it kept coming on stronger and stronger until I felt like I was on some heavy acid and speed of some kind and my head was full of pressure. I cracked up laughing cause this was a very funny feeling to be experiencing right before I went to work. I noticed my heartrate increase greatly and I thought it was about to explode. Then my head got hot inside for a minute and I had absolutely no sence of control of my body so standing up was no option at first.

After that feeling went away and I was just mildly buzzed from it, I stood up and tried inhaling the little brown bottle. Pretty much the same thing happened with slight differences only. I was standing and I cracked up again and fell to the couch. I decided I wanted to save the ampules and take the bottle to work with me. I did the nitrate about every hour that day at work, it was easy being all I had to do was smell the fumes and try not to fall over haha!

At the end of the day though I wondered how many brain cells I had killed and decided that this drug was a once in a while kinda thing.</bodytext></report>
