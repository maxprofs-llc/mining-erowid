I acquired a bottle of Soma's for muscle spasms I was having in my lower back and in my neck. The results are fantastic for genuine muscle tension, it really works if I need it. However, for me the effect wasn't as euphoric as the many other drugs I have a taste for on a recreational level.

I've had the bottle for several months but have only taken them a few times.  I know if I had a bottle of benzos like Valium or Xanax or opiates like OxyContin or Vicodin I wouldn't be able to stop myself.  I've only taken Soma when I needed it. I've never taken a large dose of them, though I know people who have, and from what I've heard and read, taking a large dose is not a good idea.

I must say, however, that one tablet with a glass of wine and herb provides a sublime high that I can't quite put my finger on.  I was by myself in my apartment, doing some cleaning, sending some e-mails, etc. and I felt good but not high.  When my roommate got home and I started trying to have a conversation, then I knew I was high.  I was saying some pretty outlandish things, and laughing my ass off.

All in all, quite enjoyable.</bodytext></report>
