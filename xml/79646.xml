I have had 20 mg of 2C-B in my possession for a while, and was saving it for the right time.  A 5 day camping trip in the Turtle Flambeau Flowage sounded like the perfect opportunity to take it.  We would be miles deep in the northern wilderness.

Two good friends J and C would also be on this trip.  We had picked out a day we would all trip.  J was eating an eighth of mushrooms. I had 20 mg of 2c-b, and C had 25 mg of 2c-b.  We were out fishing around 10 in the morning when J consumed his mushrooms.  He tripped the next few hours. We came in from fishing and attempted to make something to eat before me and C tripped.  It was a little after 1:00pm when we took our 2c-b capsules.

T+0:30: Everything seems to be getting a little brighter, but my stomach is also feeling a little upset.
/n
/n
T+0:45: The textures are starting to really pop out and Im starting to notice things I usually wouldnt notice. Talking to C, I notice a fuzzy glow around him when he would talk. I also have mild tracers when someone would get up.
/n
/n
T+1:00: I look up at the clouds and they swirl around and looked like a bunch of evil faces that were melting.  They all were grinning at me.  Even if I looked away, I would look back and they would still be there super clear.
/n
/n
T+1:15: I now start noticing patterns within all the textures that are coming out at me.  I would see all these faces in the bark of the trees, in the horizon of tree tops, even in the end of a cigarette.  J starts chopping away at a healthy tree, fairly tall.  The patterns are squirming around and seem all panicky.
/n
/n
T+1:30:  C and I decide to go into the water and walk around.  The sky is bright blue, the trees bright green, and the water crystal clear.  Everything is picture perfect.  We  see some minnows swimming around and try to catch them.  The colors in the water would change rapidly with the excitement of trying to catch these fish.  I look at my arms and feel like a young child again.

T+1:45: We go into our screen tent and sit down at a table that has flowery table cloth.  I feel clear headed. I actually feel very sober.  The visuals are all easy to ignore.
/n
/n
T+2:00:  We smoke some weed.  This is when the trip kicks into gear!  I start to notice patterns on everything!  I stare at the table cloth and look close and there are patterns all over it. Little puzzle pieces everywhere.  And the puzzle pieces turn into detailed faces right before my eyes! The table cloth is cover in tiny little detailed faces!
/n

T+2:15: The pipe is handed to me again with a fresh bowl.  When it was handed to me I came back for a second and felt sober once again. As long as I talked to someone and ignored the visuals I could be sober.  
/n
/n
T+2:20: I found myself staring at my hands.  The lines on my hands swirled all over creating patterns.  This is when things got very bizarre. Staring into the patterns in my hands I could make up anything I wanted to see.  Anything I thought about formed into the pattern in my hands and came out at me.  A pyramid with a big eyeball on top came popping out at me. 
/n
/n
T+2:30: Im still staring at my hand and it fades in color and wrinkles up and gets old right before my eyes.  I look closer, and see that my hand is made up of a bunch of geometric shapes.  Each shape on my hand has a clean red glass surface and each surface has a moving image in it and is so clear. There are dozens and dozens of these little moving images and it is absolutely mind blowing.  I feel like a little blimp floating around examining my hand. C or J must have said something cause I snap out of it and feel sober again.  I feel stupid because they are just staring at me.  C was upset because he barely tripped. He had taken 25 mg before and tripped really hard and was expecting that again, or at least to be tripping as hard as me.( because I had only taken 20mg.)
/n
/n
T+2:45: I panicked a little bit with the thought that C wasnt tripping at all and I am.  He had a higher dose than me. Whats wrong? How come Im tripping so hard and hes not? I put those thoughts behind me and just enjoyed the trip and the crazy visuals.
/n
/n
T+3:00: I figure out that 2C-B is a creative tool. It is very easy to control. I learned to concentrate on the patterns and have the things I want to see come out of them.  Everything seems really fun and easy to handle now. I grab a blank piece of paper, there are geometric patterns crawling all over it.  I grab a pen and start to trace what I see.  The drawing did absolutely no justice.  It turned out to be a bunch of waving shapes and scribbles.
/n
/n
T+3:15: I am staring at the table cloth now and the blue pattern is flowing all around the flowers and I am getting lost into it.  Staring at the flowers they begin to pop out at me and surround my vision and wrap around me. I close my eyes and open them.  J and C are staring at me again and once again I feel stupid.
/n
/n
T+3:30: I get out of the tent and walk around. J has a bunch of dirt on his feet and it swirled around his ankle creating a bracelet of tribal patterns.
/n
/n
T+4:00: The patterns start to die off but everything I look at still looks like faces.
/n
/n
T+4:30: I feel back to baseline and we all go fishing.

The rest of that night and the rest of the camping trip I kept analyzing the trip and everything I saw and it gave me a wonderful feeling.  I feel very enlightened from the trip. The visuals I saw were absolutely mind blowing. I didnt think your mind could create such intricate, detailed patterns.</bodytext></report>
