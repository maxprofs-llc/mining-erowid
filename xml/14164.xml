I occasionally have a major insomnia problem. I tossed and turned for 2 hours, until I got pissed. I remembered some combinatrion off of this section for getting some sleep.

T+1: 3:30 AM As soon as I hit the pillow, I was in between wake and dreaming yet aware. The body buzz was comparible to a high dose of heroin...I kept reaching semi-awake with all of the laughter I found from within. I was laughing my ass off in a hypnogagic state and had no control over it. I was too nodded out.

My dreams were so vivid I Cannot believe they were only dreams. I traveled a lot. All 6 senses were intact. I could predict what people were thinking. In one instance I was in an orgy with two females that had colored hair. As soon as we were finished I felt a bigger presence. I saw a shadow from behind us, and turned around. A very tall man with a weird high-tech outfit who claimed to be the devil commanded me to leave. I told him to go to hell, and he said this wAS hell. I laughed as he made flies cover me. Next he grew in size and was almost transparent in the scenery like he was superimposed. The whole realm blew up as I awoke.</bodytext></report>
