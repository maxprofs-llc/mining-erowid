Pill:  at first tastes a bit sour, then more like a walnut.  Not a super strong taste.  No noticeable change in color of tongue or urine.

Ok it's been a few minutes now and it hasn't fully dissolved yet.  I'm taking this opportunity to look up miracle fruit on Wikipedia.

Ok its been like 10 minutes.  I hope the patience pays off.

Ok done

Orange:  I'm picking this first because it's the least strong in terms of sourness and I don't want to mess up my taste buds for later.  Kinda like how you start wine tasting with a white.  Although it would be cool to jump straight to hot sauce and see how great it is, but I don't want to climax prematurely here.

Ok the orange tastes more or less the same, but just really really good.  Like almost artificially good like an orange fruit snack.  If I didn't have more to taste I'd eat this whole orange (and I just had dinner so I'm not hungry).   The aftertaste is just of orange.  That was yummy.  Time to move on.

Lime:  Ok I'm laughing hysterically now.  I am a believer.  Before I tasted it the juice got into a little crack in my lip and burnt and I thought, uh oh this is gonna be bad.  Its burning bad so I know this is a normal lime.  It tastes amazing though.  Again, like a fruit snack.  I'm giggling.

Lemon:  I just ate the whole thing.  My stomach burns haha.  Wikipedia said it doesn't change the chemistry of the food, so the acid is still there.  I'm also burping and I never burp.
/n
/n
Onion:  Ok time for the big guns.  Wow my stomach burnssssss.  Ok it smells like onion, but it has no taste.  It's like unflavored yogurt.  So definitely a remarkable change, but it's not sweet like the other things have been.  I would suggest this for when you are going to eat somewhere and you know it's going to be bad.

Sugar Cube:  Not much flavor.  Could have been overpowered by the onion.  Should have eaten that first but I forgot.  I'm licking the lemon juice off my lips and its yummy.

Jose Cuervo Especial:  I don't really like tequila.  It tastes different.  I still don't like it.  It tastes more earthy, wooden, or maybe fried chicken.

70 something % dark chocolate:  tastes the same.  Maybe it's wearing off.  Nope it's not I just went back to the lime and it still tastes like getting a paycheck.
/n
/n
Peri-peri African pepper sauce: not much change.  Maybe a little less spicy.  
/n

E&amp;J Very Special Old Pale Superior Reserve (Sounds fancy but it was $8 and came with a flask!): I don't drink enough brandy to know what this is supposed to taste like normally.  I can say for sure that this is better than the tequila was.

Water: no change
/n
/n
Honey: no change
/n

What little lemon is left still tastes about 75% as good as before, so that's a good way to make sure it hasn't worn off.

Uggggghhh stomach ache.

When it comes to super acidic things, just because you can, doesn't mean you should.  Stop after  of a lemon or something.</bodytext></report>
