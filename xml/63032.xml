So after almost being evicted by my parents for smoking weed again, even though I'm a vocal legal weed proponent (doesn't phase them), I decided that I would attempt to find another, more legal way to satisfy my need to get messed up on occasion. My best friend then read about this stuff called kava, a plant in the pepper family grown and traditionally consumed in the pacific islands.

The active ingredients in kava are numerous, and all fall under the group known as alkaloids, more specifically, kavalactones. Anyone who knows anything about brain chemistry also knows that MAOIs (like those found in passion flower) amplify the effect of a wide variety of alkaloids to a great degree. Note however: mixing MAOIs with ANY NUMBER OF THINGS can be dangerous, so be very mindful of your decisions and what it is you eat. So I decided after some reading that mixing these two legal plants for an intoxicating effect was not the worst of the legal inebriations I have dreamt up.

At about 11:15 pm, I brewed up a strong pot of coffee (2 1/2 scoops) to counter the double sedative effects of passion flower and kava. In retrospect, this was dumb: caffeine reacts very badly with MAOIs in high concentrations, and even in low concentrations can leave a nasty headache. I won't do it again, and I didn't learn about this interaction until after I consumed both. But nevertheless, I downed the coffee, and within minutes was wired as expected. I then sat down and began to read up on kava brewing recipes while munching the passion flowers. Very strong generic plant taste, nasty but not intolerable. This being my second night in a row to have kava in my system, I expected good things since kava has a reverse tolerance. After the last passion flower, I was feeling relaxed and clear-headed, while still energetic from the caffeine.

I mixed up some kava drink with ~2 1/2 tbsp kava powder, strained, in 12 oz. of water, along with oz. of lemon juice, 2 oz of pure cane syrup, and a few ice cubes. After profuse stirring, I began to drink. The flavor was tolerable at first, and kava's aroma is quite inviting. Near the end of the glass, there tended to be a vomit-like aftertaste, so I took to closing my nostrils while consuming. This allowed much speedier consumption.

Within 20 minutes of starting the glass, I was as drunk in the body as 4 or 5 beers would do me (pretty good past-driving buzz), but I was still thinking clearly. It was hard for me to tell I was drunk until I stood up, and almost fell over onto my bed. I then called my best friend and proceded to talk with him for 30 minutes about the possibilities of kava. He and I are nerdy science geeks that popular high school kids like, cuz we dream up great ways of getting wasted. We talked about purifying kava, extracting kava, etc.

I then felt the urge to drink more, as my buzz was beginning to wear off. I then mixed a replica of my earlier beverage, and downed it more quickly. Once again, the feelings came about 15 to 20 minutes later in full force, leaving me thoroughly drunk (8 to 9 beers), and I was starting to notice I had very limited control of my body. It became difficult to stand up, and it was more pleasurable to sit anyways.

I wanted badly to masturbate, so I indulged. It ended in the most amazing orgasm I have ever had - better than any I've had in actual sex! After this, the effects began to subside, though my head continued to feel heavy until I went to sleep at about 3:30 am. Something I found remarkably fun was to throw my head around at a medium speed in a big swooping circle to cause random dizziness. I do not recommend doing this standing - you may fall down.

I awoke the next morning at 6:00 with a surprisingly light headache, and overall in a good, relaxed mood. Kava's wonderful reasonless happiness after-effect is much like weed, but the mental clarity never leaves. I was very chill and calm, almost drowsy, but very sociable and nice to people.

I highly recommend kava consumption to people that enjoy drunkeness but do not like hangovers and clouded judgement, and to people that enjoy a baseline calm happiness the next day. I do not, however, recommend the consumption of any MAOI-containing substance unless you know what you are doing. Pulling a caffeine mistake like I did with more passion flower could have been a hospital visit, and would definitely not been fun.

Paying extra for better/fresher kava is worth the money. And allow yourself 3 uses 3 days in a row before making a conclusion about the plant. My first night was rather boring. I simply relaxed.</bodytext></report>
