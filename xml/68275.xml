I am writing this experience report on the relatively new drug Oxymorphone (Opana)
/n
I recently recieved a green hexagon shaped tablet with only 20 on one side. I was eagerly anticipating getting home and snorting it in my area I pay a dollar a milligram for these babies 20 bucks for twenty milligrams, some of you may disagree, I think it's worth it!

So I get home and put on some music, take my coat off, fix a drink, blow my nose and get ready to do this little fucker!

I break out a slab of glass and cut a straw in half. I put the pill in my mouth and suck on it for a little bit and then spit it out into a paper towel the pill is quite slippery so wipe the rest of the coating off. I take the cellophane off of my cigarettes and place it on top of the pill, take my ID out of my wallet and put it on top of that and take my lighter and crush that baby up! I divide the powder in half (one for each nostril-so none gets left out!) and get the straw well up into my nose and bam call me dirt devil!

I take a sip of pop the drainage taste a little strange, but what the hell! I start feeling the effects about 10 minutes later and it lasted for about 4 hours! delicious!</bodytext></report>
