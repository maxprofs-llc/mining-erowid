hi I am a 22 year old male who has much expierence with this drug, as well as most any drug with the exception of some of the new designer drugs. Anyhow I'll just give a brief description of effects if snorted.

t0:00- chop up about 3-7mg a pretty decent dose, sniff, the smell I find is similar to a permanent marker, but its burns slightly but subsides fast.
/n
/n
t0:10- first effects are felt, slight increase in pulse &amp; heart rate, feeling a nice mild rush thats going to build for a while
/n

T0:10+- stimulation increases but not much physical, good for concentration, mood lift, social, good to party with as well maybe for a rave due to the length.
/n
/n
T10:00+ still feeling effects mild now but pesistant and the sketch will last for a while. I've known people who were awake for days following a normal dose and others who do to much repeatedly tend to become delirious and potential dangerous.
/n
/n
T-???- continued use of the substance causes paranoia, delusional thoughts and possible hallucinations. please take caution, start small, be smart. please forgive spelling mistakes</bodytext></report>
