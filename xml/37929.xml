I wanted to give a little information on methadone as I haven't seen all that much posted as far as experiences. I've been addicted to opiates for a little over 4 years and have used every thing under the sun. My main drug of choice was oc's and heroin. I used methadone in my time off and on but it's not the best recreational opiate. It's effects are very slow, not like other opiates. It usually takes at least an hour to feel anything, about 1 and 1/2 hours to get the full effect of euphoria. Other pills taken orally usually hit me in about 25-30minutes so this can cause problems because people will dose, and then redose thinking it wasn't enough, getting them really sick. It absorbs in the body very slowly no matter how you take it and the most effective is to swallow it.

It wasn't until I stopped using opiates recreationally that I started using methadone full time. In order to help me stop using street drugs and abuse prescription pills I entered a methadone clinic. They made me withdraw (which really sucks if you haven't had the chance) then based on my history they worked me up to your daily dose.

One of the interesting things about methadone is that it blocks the effects of other opiates. So if I take methadone and percocet together I am pretty much waisting the percocet as it fills the receptors opiates bond to. The good thing for an addict like me is if I take enough of it, I can't get high off of other opiates. It allows me to fuction in life and not have to worry about scoring dope and feeling cravings all the time. It doesn't have the euphoria associated with it other people get. This is because I take it every day and have developed a tolerance. When I first started at the clinic I had a mild buzz, but that was because they make me withdraw before I could start, so that there are no drug interactions they won't know about. I do get a mild glow an hour or two after I take it but nothing like other opiates.

It has worked great for me and I advise it for anyone who has struggled with opiate addiction in the past. It is a 1000x times better than going through the living hell that is addiction. Don't listen to people who say that you are just trading one addiction for another. Opiate addicts have a chemical imbalance in the brain which methadone fixs. You wouldn't tell a diabetic to not take insolin would you?

In closing I wouldn't really recommend methadone for recreational use as it has a slow onset and lasts for a very long time. For the first time user it might be a little intense. I remember when my girlfriend only took 10mg and she was still high the next day and threw up at school.</bodytext></report>
