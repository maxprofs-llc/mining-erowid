It started off with a trip to my friends University. He called me up and asked if I'd like to come for a visit, and to try some mushrooms. There was no way I could turn down an old friend.:)

A week later I'm on the bus to my friends university with another friend, also going for the shrooms and to visit. I'd read a lot about mushrooms and I was very prepared. To get my mind into the right frame before taking mushrooms, I decided to read a childhood book I had always cherished, Sideways Stories from Wayside High. The book always made me feel good, and reminded me of my public elementary school days, a time I adore to this day. I read the book on the way up to the University.

Upon arrival, I settled my luggage into my friends dorm room and then headed next door to pick up the mushrooms. I met some of his friends and we chatted for a bit, then we all ate the shrooms. We stayed in his neighbours room for a bit, but I began to get uncomfortable with the hosts dominant behaviour (he forbid anybody to speak, as it might ruin his high) and so I left. I got some fresh air and began to feel a little dizzy. I was a little frightened as I did not expect the facial twitches which came a little after the dizziness. I walked back to my friends dorm and he was a little upset because I had left without telling him, and he had been searching the halls for me. I said to him, 'Let's just go relax in your dorm, watch the tube and enjoy the trip' and he replied 'that's all I've wanted to do from the start'.

At his dorm we settled in front of the TV and began to watch the tube. We watched Teletoon, an all animation channel. It was playing Aqua Teen Hunger Force, which is very surreal even when not on mushrooms. As we watched, I began to feel like a child again. I started giggling at everything that happened, with the wide mouthed expression that a child would have when he's being amused by a game of peek-a-boo. Now I'm a big guy, so I can only imagine what this must have looked like to my friends, but they were off in their own worlds.

The friend that had come down with me brought cookies with him, which he shared with us and they tasted oh so good. I was still in the child like state of mind, so when I was eating the cookies, I was getting crumbs all over me and I didn't care. I had five cookies in both hands and chocolate residue all over my face. I would take a bite of my cookie, giggle at the tv and pay no attention to the mess I had made on my t-shirt. I didn't care, I was 6 again and I was enjoying the things the way I did when I was six -- carefree!

I was even friendlier. I noticed that my friend did not have a cookie. He was lying near to me, with his back against my friends bed. Without saying a thing, I put a cookie on his stomach and then turned my attention back to Aqua Teen Hunger Force. There was a rapping spider on it, and went by the name of MC Pee Pants, which the name alone, made me giggle outrageously. A humour I'm not often prone to.

After about 3 hours, I began to come down. I did have some minor hallucinations during the intensity of the high, I saw toonies(Canadian two dollar coins) everywhere, red and green tracers, and a sinking feeling when I was lying down.

My overall mood for the high was childish, which I attribute to the state of mind I cultivated before dosing. I began to reconnect with my childhood before dosing, by reading Sideways Stories From Wayside High, and the shrooms seemed to make this connection more powerful. It felt good to revisit a simpler time, when I could eat cookies and make a mess, watch tv and giggle without a care. It felt good to be a kid again.</bodytext></report>
