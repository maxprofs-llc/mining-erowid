My partner and I recently had the opportunity to do 5 MeO DiPT a couple of times, relatively close together (a week apart), and use 1,4 BD one of the times, then GBL, the other, to mellow out the trip.

We both enjoy our foxy experiences, but have come to realize that GBL or GHB plays a vital role. Without this anxiolytic, the journey is an irritating teeth grinding one. With it, we have a great time.

So, in comparison, 1,4 BD + foxy gave us experientially similar trips to what we had experienced in the past using GBL or GHB with foxy, but we both got nasty headaches by the 6-7 hour, and feelings of toxicity and hangover the next day. The week after, when we repeated the night with GBL instead of 1,4 BD, neither of us had any hangover or noticeable body load other than that usually attributable to 5 MeO DiPT, not sleeping and having sex all night.

We will never do 1,4 BD again, and that experience prompted me to throw the remainder of the chemical out.</bodytext></report>
