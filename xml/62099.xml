At 22, I am enjoying myself, getting through college, and liking boys.  One of my excellent stress relievers is to enjoy a substance, and while under the influence, make love.  It makes sex more spiritual.  This experience with mushrooms and sex is worth telling.

Finding mushrooms was not difficult.  I asked a guy that was selling regular gourmet mushrooms at a farmers market that I have known for awhile.  He came up with 2.5 grams of dried shrooms, and said that they were a variety called oasis.

So, I invited my man over on a Saturday afternoon.  He called me about 45 minutes before he arrived and about 10 minutes before he arrived, I ingested 1.00 grams of dried shrooms.  The mushrooms were chopped finely, and taken on a slice of rye bread with honey.  My intention was to enhance my environment, and not take a mind bending trip, so I think my dosage was lower than one might want to take.  I told my man that I had taken some shrooms, and wanted to feel him while the shrooms had me.

About 30 minutes after ingestion, my sense of smell became much more intense.  Take for instance, if I smell a pizza.  Well this was like, smelling the ingredients of a pizza, instead of smelling just the pizza.  My man was with me, lying on the bed, with his shirt off.  I was taking in his essence.  This made me incredibly amorous.

As we made love, the oneness became overwhelming,  I truly have never been so close to someone.  Every sensation was amplified.  He began at my feet, and enveloped me.  I became part of him, like I was inside of him.  This was incredible, and the culmination of this was long lasting.

The amplification, of sexual contact caused by low doses of mushrooms is beyond compare.</bodytext></report>
