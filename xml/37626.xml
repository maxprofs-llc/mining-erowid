I've only tried nutmeg twice in my life. The first time I took it I did not have the patience to wait for it to take full effect. Instead I smoked an 1/8 of skunk with some mates and was completely munted by lunch time.

The second time I took it I was far more patient as I had no weed. Over the last couple of years I've experimented with a few different drugs, mostly hallucinogens, so I felt that I would be fairly well prepared for nutmeg. I hadn't eaten for about 16 hours before taking the stuff. As I was all by myself I decided to only eat 1/2 at first, saving the other half for a couple of hours later. I had read reports of intense nutmeg experiences and I didn't want to completely freak out all by myself so I was cautious.

I had learnt my lesson about trying to mask the taste of this stuff by mixing it with ice cream from my previous experience. Instead, I decided to make little parcels out of cigarette papers. This only took about 10 minutes in total and is by far the best way (that I've heard of at least) to take it.

After an hour or two I began to feel different. I wasn't sure what had changed, but I knew something was out of place. It wasn't long before this feeling grew and I began to recognise this sensation. It was like being stoned except I had a little more clarity and I hadn't been completely drained of my energy either.

At this point I decided to take a walk. I live on campus at one of England's largest campus universities. This meant that everything I needed was within a very short walking distance. I borrowed a film from the library (I had opted for The Matrix over A Clockwork Orange, which was a bad idea is over the rest of that day I developed a strong desire to watch the latter) and bought a selection of nice ale and red wine. On the way back I really began to notice how beautiful nature was. My uni's right out in the countryside, I was surrounded by trees. This wasn't trippy at all, I simply noticed the greenery around me more than I usually did. However, I did have one (suspected) audio hallucination on the walk back. I heard some bizarre noise on the way back. I can't describe it exactly but it seemed to rise above all the other noise.

When I got back to my room I began to feel that this had been a waste of time. That the stories I had heard about how good nutmeg was were written by the same people who promote all that 'natural high' crap that costs a small fortune and has no effect at all. So I decided to take the rest of my nutmeg, in parcels again. This time I had eaten something, a few bowls of cereal and a packet of cookies (the first dose of nutmeg had given me the munchies). I spent a few hours just hanging around, waiting for something to happen. I looked at my face in the mirror and noticed that my eyes were really bloodshot. It was only when I stood up to do this that I realised how my mind had changed, it was as if the sudden increase of heart rate had provoked the drug into showing just what it was capable of at this stage.

I now felt really stoned. This was a feeling that continued to grow over the day. I had some minor closed eye visuals (the same kind that can be achieved on weed) when I played a recording of someone reading 'The Kubla Khan' by Coleridge. This was really cool, I would definitely recommend listening to any kind of trippy poetry/music/recordings when on hallucinogenic drugs. The nutmeg seemed to peak approximately 12 hours after I took my first does. By this time I was too tired to stay awake and see what else would happen, so I chose to crash whilst watching a DVD of 'Spaced'.

When I woke up the next day I felt fine, until I got out of bed. I felt a little woozy at first but this cleared in less than a minute. I looked in the mirror and my eyes were still red. I was still feeling really stoned and continued to for the next day and a half. It's now almost a week later and, as with my first time on nutmeg, there are some lingering side effects. Firstly, half of my left eye is still bloodshot. This has prompted people to ask whether I'm stoned. However, as this is only in one eye I think I can pass it off as some kind of medical problem. Secondly, I have pins and needles in my right hand (only half of it though, the half where my ring and little fingers are). These symptoms are nothing to worry about as far as I'm concerned as they should go within the next two or three weeks. Having spoken to med students about this I am convinced that these side effects have occurred only because I have circulatory problems, I doubt that they would occur in most people using nutmeg.

In total, the nutmeg had affected me for about 60hours. However, it hadn't been the exciting adventure I thought it would be. I felt really stoned for a couple of days and would have definitely enjoyed it more with others. I think that nutmeg is best used as either and alternative to weed because it's ridiculously cheap and last a hell of a lot longer than ganj, or as a bed for other drugs (i.e. you take your nutmeg early in the morning and by tea time your dropping a few tabs of acid or a big bowl of fresh mushrooms).</bodytext></report>
