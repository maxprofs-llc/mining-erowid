First a little background on me: 
/n
/n
I'm 21 years old, and I've spent the last 6 years as a pretty regular marijuana smoker. I smoke just about every day. I work as a graphic designer, and a joint in the late afternoon is priceless for recharging my creative juice!
/n
/n
Up until this year I had never tried any other recreational drug beyond pot. While I consider myself a risk-taker and adventurous, I'm protective of my mind. I have a very non-addictive personality and it's easy for me to turn down a session or a drink when I'm busy or not in the mood. It was a combination of this fact, and moving into my own apartment that has given me the confidence to experiment with other drugs. In the last 5 months I've shroomed, dropped acid, and taken Vicodin. They were all great experiences, and Vicadin has become something my buddies and I enjoy taking occasionally before smoking weed.

Now to my experience with Oxycontin:
/n
/n
A relative of mine was given a prescription for Oxycontin in 20 mg pills following surgery. My positive reactions to Vicodin made me curious to try Oxycontin just once. Still, I debated it with myself for almost a month before finally tucking three of the tiny pink pills into my pocket while last visiting my family.
/n
/n
I think it is extremely important to research any drug you are curious to try, and so I gathered as much dosage and reactionary info as I could on oxycontin. I read plenty of negative and cautionary information, but felt that since the prescription was non-refillable, this would be my only opportunity to obtain the powerful opioid. I think if I had a permanent connection to the drug, I probably never would have tried it. 
/n
/n
I knew I had the choice to either snort it, inject it, or chew it. Swallowing a whole pill does not deliver the drug quickly enough through your system. The thought of snorting it crossed my mind for a second, but I decided that it would feel too much like I was doing cocaine, and that's a line I will never venture across. Oxycontin will be the furthest I ever climb up the opiate tree.
/n
/n
So at about noon on a beautiful Sunday - back in the comfort of my apartment - I turned on a movie, set the three pills on a ceramic plate, and crushed them into a fine powder. I took a drink of water to wet my mouth, and then licked the powder off the plate. I know it sounds like a bit of a strange way to ingest a drug, but I had a bad experience as a kid when I stupidly chewed a Tylonol. Licking the plate tasted just as bad, but i didn't have to deal with picking chunks of dissolving Oxycontin out from between my teeth. It was actually a very easy way to take the drug, and I certainly recommend it over chewing. I drank the rest of the water and sat back to watch tv.
/n
/n
Within twenty minutes I was feeling different. It was similar to the onset of Vicodin, and that fact definitely eased my mind. My body felt loose and heavy, and I started losing concentration on the movie. After ten more minutes I got up to refill my water. I knew right away that I was walking funny. It felt as though my mind had turned over control of walking to my legs, and the rest of my body was following them. I grabbed some water, and by the time I reached the couch again, my head was spinning. It wasn't a bad spinning, but it was a very unique feeling. I'd opened the windows earlier to get some fresh air into the stuffy apartment, and I was suddenly very cold. I grabbed a blanket, and curled up to watch the movie.
/n
/n
My body felt very heavy like most painkiller/muscle relaxers will do, but there was an added sensitivity to touch. This was first evident when I reached down to scratch my thigh. I chill ran up my spine as soon my fingertips touched my leg. It wasn't a sexual or introspective moment, just more of an general excitement or surprise.
/n
/n
Then the itching started. First it was my balls. I thought I just needed to shower. (Haha!) Then it moved up my body to my stomach. Strangely, I welcomed each place that needed to be itched, and thought of it almost like a game. The combination of itching, and the resulting goosebumps and chills when I would itch was a great, euphoric feeling. I must've spent almost 45 minutes just laying there staring blankly at the t.v. and itching my stomach, arms, legs and back. 
/n
/n
There were two phone calls, and I had to focus pretty strongly on talking intelligently. But it wasn't a drunk-sort-of stupidity, nor stupidity at all. I think my speech may have been a little slurred at worst, and I had trouble maintaining a consistent attitude. It was as though my reactions were turned up a notch. My buddy said something that normally would've mildly annoyed me. Instead I went off on him for a minute, and when I realized what I was doing, I apologized and that turned into me feeling really terrible. I knew I had to get off the phone.
/n
/n
After this, I started to get a mild nauseous feeling. It came on first as I went to sit back down after taking a leak in the bathroom. I sat there for maybe a minute, nauseated and on the brink of vomiting. But I didn't. And I knew I wasn't going to. But all the sensations were there. 
/n
/n
All of these feelings of euphoria, intense relaxation, difficulty concentrating, and itching continued for nearly two hours. The nausea came on and off, and looking back I think it was because I'd eaten almost nothing the entire morning. I tried at one point to sit at the computer and talk to a college friend online, but it was difficult and annoying and in less than 2 minutes I signed off without saying goodbye.
/n
/n
At about 2 PM I laid back down on the couch. It was then that I realized I was sweating. I'd gone from being relatively cold to needing to undress i was so warm. I stripped down to boxers and sat lazily on the couch trying to figure out the point of the movie. I was enjoying the 'high' very much, but also confused at the wide gamut of sensations. I was euphoric and relaxed, but also nauseated and itchy; once cold, then suddenly hot.
/n
/n
Around 3 PM I dozed off for a little bit, and I was almost completely aware of the moment I went from being awake to sleeping. It was an interesting sensation.
/n
/n
It is now almost 5 hours later, and it felt like 10 minutes ago it was noon. I'm still in an altered state, though I'm much closer to sober than not. I'm at the point I need to take a nap, and I'm contemplating whether or not I enjoyed the experience.
/n
/n
I have no problem never taking Oxycontin again, because the feelings I had during my trip were just amplified and mutated sensations I get from taking Vicodin, but Oxycontin is several times more dangerous. Maybe snorting or injecting Oxycontin, or taking it in a larger dose, would change these sensations, but I'm just fine with the method and amount of the drug I took.

Oxycontin is an extremely volatile opiate, and highly addictive when abused. If you have access to the drug, please start with only a small dose. I'm a regular guy, just slightly above-average sized: in very good shape and 6-foot tall. 60 milligrams was a pretty good amount for me, and I don't believe that taking more would have made it more enjoyable, just stronger. If you've never taken pharms before, especially a strong painkiller, be careful.

If you trust yourself to be mature and careful, Oxycontin can be a unique experience. If not, at least you will have found places to itch you never even knew existed!</bodytext></report>
