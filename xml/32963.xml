It was a Sunday evening; me and two buddies, call them J and M, had 7 hours to blow. It was around midnight when all of us decided to take some DXM for fun.

All of us consider ourselves to be fairly experienced with drugs. We've tried just about everything except heroin. I could say at this point I'm at an experimental stage with drugs. I enjoy trying new substances as many new substances as possible, with an affinity towards hard trips that both alter the mind, and the visual. Maybe I'm searching for the perfect drug, or maybe I don't want to limit myself to just one type of experience. It's probably both reasons. This evening I unknowingly would have one of the most beautiful and enjoyable trips of my life.

Tonight I would be taking DXM and DPT together. I've taken DXM many times, usually around the 450mg oral dosage. We use a jeweler's scale to measure doses, with an accuracy of +/- 2mg. I've taken DPT two previous times. The first time I insufflated 25 mg, received no visuals, and felt a slight tripping effect. The next time, I insufflated 75mg and received major visuals, however my friend who took DPT with me had a horrible bad trip, so I spent most of my trip trying to coach him through his bad trip and not have one myself. It is worth noting that I received some crazy visuals on this trip, although it is difficult to describe the trip because I was unable to focus on positive aspects of the drug while coaching my friend through his bad trip.

At midnight, each of us would place the measured DXM dosages into a small square of toilet paper, wrap it up, and swallow the wad of drug and paper. Living in Chicago, the weather is usually very cold, but this evening was very mild and windy, so we decided to spend our trip outside. We walked over to a field of grass with blankets and laid out on the grass. Each of us had a very positive mindset, ready to have a blast this night.

Much of the night was spent talking about different subjects (life and death, religion, other drugs and experiences). Other times it was very quiet, where we spent hours meditating or thinking silently. I can't say this trip was rather profound; for me it was a typical DXM trip, long and enjoyable, but nothing too crazy. After around 3 hours of laying out in the grass field, me and M went exploring different public buildings. Normal things such as elevators and doors seemed quite strange. As we pressed the '3' button on the elevator and the doors closed, we looked at each other as if to say 'what have we done'. Negative feelings washed over me and I imagined the elevator stopping and leaving us locked inside, until a janitor came to discover us tripping our balls off while locked inside. The ride up to the 3rd floor seemed a bit long, but eventually the doors opened and we walked around. It was around 3:30am, and nobody was to be seen in the building. We walked back to meet and J, and returned home.

Thus far, I had enjoyed my DXM trip, but I felt it was time to take this trip to a new level. I decided we should walk to the beach and watch the sunrise after snorting DPT. M measured out 50mg doses of DPT powder into tin foil, which he twisted into little 'holders'. It was around 5:30 or so when we arrived at the beach, still dark. The major effects of the DXM had begun to wear off, but I could still feel the after effects of the trip. We unwrapped the tin foil holders and snorted the 50mg of DPT. For a moment I was worried, thinking that some of the DPT had blown off in the wind.

We waited with anticipation. The come up on DPT has a very distinct feeling to it. I can feel it in my body, but I am not exactly tripping or seeing anything. About 10-20 minutes after snorting, M says 'I'm tripping my balls off'. Shortly after I looked down at concrete we sat on. It began to flow like liquid into the sand, and I laid back to enjoy one of the best trips of my life. The motion of the concrete was similar to the motion of brownie batter being mixed with an electric mixer, though at a much slower rate. All of the little pebbles and discolorations of the concrete moved in waves. Sometimes the concrete would rise up towards my body, in the shape of a jelly blob trying to communicate with me. I knew this was not real, and so it did not frighten me. The thought of my eyes being able to see the impossible was amazing.

I knew the drug was forcing my brain to change the way it functions visually, but to see reality like this through my  own eyes, in a way that totally defies physics and everyday freak occurrences is quite amazing.

The sun began to peek over the horizon behind the clouds. Seagulls would fly overhead, leaving long rainbow colored trails behind them. I focused on the clouds, as the wind quickly blew them across my field of vision. My balance was off, and even though I was laying on my back, I felt as though I was sitting up and looking forward. As the clouds blew forward, they appeared to trickle down like gobs milky liquid on a sheet of glass, being pulled down by gravity. If I focused on the outline of a cloud, I would see the outline 3 more times around the cloud, each distinctly red green and blue in color. The visual effects came in waves of time. Other times if I looked at an empty space in the sky, a kaleidoscopic fractal of colors would grow outward from my point of focus and slowly work its way to my peripheral vision. Once my I moved my eyes to another area in the sky, the pattern would disappear and begin growing again at my new point of focus.

At one point I looked over to the trees on my right. The trees were dark, tall, and had many many small branches at the top. They were also planted in layers, so that some trees were far and some near. As the wind blew, the branches would shift from left to right, and the near trees would obscure the branches of other trees behind. This sort of motion deceived my eyes, and it appeared as if the branches were splitting off and growing higher at a rapid rate. It sort of reminded me of those time elapse videos of growing plants.

The clouds then began to take on a heavenly quality, slowly drifting through the sky. Not only did they appear heavenly, I felt I was in the presence a heavenly being. The spectacle that lay before me was trying to communicate by displaying its awesome beauty. At times the clouds took on the quality of a snow flake. It was as if each cloud was radial symmetrical. They took on a sort of crystalline quality, both in shape and shimmer. They would slowly melt into different snowflakes, while sliding over top of each other in what seemed to be infinite layers. I'm not a religious person, but if I could imagine what heaven looks like, this would be it. I felt completely in awe of what I was seeing and how there could be such beauty in the randomness of nature. The outside world was nonexistent to me. It was only me and the clouds above. The only thing that would bring me back to reality was the seagulls that would occasionally cross my vision above.

The sounds I heard reminded me of the oscillating buzz sound I get while doing nitrous. It wasn't as pronounced, but the sound was definitely altered. The experience was mostly visual, however DPT has a way of shooting me into another dimension. Though my mind knows where it is, and though I am seeing familiar objects in a new way, I truly feel like I am in a completely different world. This might be scary for some, but I enjoyed it immensely. Everyone should try DPT at least once, with a trip sitter or experienced DPT user.

After this experience, I will never look at the sky the same way again, because each time I will be reminded of this amazing trip I had.</bodytext></report>
