I must say, along with the others that have posted here on this unique substance, that it is, unlike any other. I have shroomed, fried, baked, tweaked and just about everything else and NOTHING can compare to this.

I started, early in the morning, outside in a lawn chair facing my neighboring apartments, there was a small hill that seperated us. I had heard to use a water pipe with a butane torch lighter. Luckily I had bought this equipment and a small bowl of 10x Salvia was loaded and ready. Clearing my lungs I then torched and sucked in the smoke (it was somewhat harsh, yet reminded me of a pot hit) and felt the choke of the bulk of it coming in and just held it for about 30 seconds then I slowly blew it out.

It was a couple seconds (5-10, maybe?) afterwards that my vision before me began to intensify and then there was a crackle like noise associated with the edges of any object in sight. It was like the universe was behind everything in my vision but only noticeable around the edges of every object, the edges were like a bright green/purple/yellow pixelated constantly changing assortment.  At the same time my body was being twisted counterclockwise slowly, it is similar to when I am really drunk and I get the spins. I began to hear a woman whispering some sort of chant/song like 'Why don't you come with me? Why don't you come with me?' and a sort of drum like thrump at the end of each sentence. There were things taking shape from the scenery and were approving her invitation to me.

At that moment I stood up and very haphazardly turned to open my back sliding door and slip through. This was very difficult because my body was rubbery and kind of like how on acid if I put my hand in my pocket it feels a mile deep. I managed to make it to the computer and around the monitor was a beautiful aura of shifting colors with that crackle like noise. I have a train background on my desktop where it is coming at me and to the right. Looking at this, under the influence of Salvia, it was VERY vivid and 3 dimensional. I was startled by the depth and realism as if I could just walk right in. During this time, I felt a 'presence' behind me that was watching everything through my eyes and occasionally it would 'merge' with me and the effects would intensify (sounds of chanting, colors brighten, ect). Then, I began to feel reality slowly settle in. It was noticed as everything stabilizing and 'hardening' like the furniture desk I was at. And, after a few more moments I just felt a little light headed and surprised at how strange this had all been.

Prior to this I had tried leaves with minimal effect (body change notice, head feeling a little light) and the water pipe WITHOUT hitting it hard. I found that you must apply the torch on the Salvia and inhale as hard as you can, try not to cough and then clear it as fast as possible. Hold it in until you think your going to die, then blow it out sloooowly. By the time the last wisp of smoke has left you it will kick in.

This was a very enjoyable experience, and I look forward to 'Why don't you come with me' again. :)</bodytext></report>
