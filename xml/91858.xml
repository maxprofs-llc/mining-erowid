Hello.
/n
/n
I'm 36, male, 220 lb 
/n
I've been taking 10,000 to 12,000 mg of Neurontin per day for almost two years.
/n
/n
My therapist and psychiatrist and do not condone this because I'm a recovering addict--clean for two years now. Although it's not addictive, I've been severely weening off for three days now, and I'm in intense pain and feel sick with the flu. So this morning I took my usual amount, and my chronic neck pain went away and I feel productive and 'awake' again.
/n
I don't get high from it. I'd like to get feedback before I take further action.</bodytext></report>
