After two cups of Guayaki Yerba Mate tea I went into atrial flutter after some stress and exertion while climbing a flight of stairs.

Spent 14 hours in the emergency room and three and a half days in hospital, including an electrophysiology study during which they ablated my heart to alter the current path.  They cardio converted me during the procedure.  During the episode my heart rate was 120 to 130 bpm.

I had some susceptibility, having had 3 atrial fibrillation episodes in the last 7 years, 2 from alcohol and exertion and one from hoodia.  If someone has any susceptibility to this, I would recommend they avoid Yerba Mate.</bodytext></report>
