I had had a very troublesome year with severe depression and was not responding to various SSRI's and SNRI's. I ended up with some GBL and took a dose of around 2ml. My depression instantly lifted, as well as all of my anxiety and I was able to function normally. Once it's effects had worn away, I re-dosed.

I found myself in a pattern of frequent dosing, at the worst point I was re-dosing every 2 hours or less. I had developed a massive tolerance for the substance. After several months I was collapsing more and injuring myself after taking it. I was unable to hold down more than 2 hours sleep at a time as my body would wake me up to re-dose. Also I have read about a possible 'dopamine rebound,' that being that when you take GHB/GBL dopamine levels are supressed and rebound after a few hours...making you more alert and anxious. I can say that I most certainly would feel these effects.

I was literally a mess, I couldn't function properly anymore, nobody wanted to be around me and I couldn't go anywhere without taking GBL with me.

I decided to cut down my use in an attempt to stop, taking a lesser dose less often. I went to bed and woke up a few hours later not knowing where I was, who I was or what was going on. I was in such a state of confusion and my whole body was shaking violently. I began vomiting everywhere. After a few moments I some how instinctively had a shot of GBL and all of these withdrawal symptoms evaporated.

I knew then that I needed medical help to stop my GBL intake. I sought help and found it nearly impossible and none of the doctors seemed to know what it was. I spent two days educating different groups of doctors and being passed from one place to the next.

Eventually an addiction specialist contacted a GHB/GBL specialist in London, whereupon he was immediately advised on the correct course of action.

I was prescribed up to 80mg of diazepam a day, but was allowed to take up to 125mg if needed for the first 3/4 days. Diazepam however works on the GABAa subset of receptors, and not the GABAb subset (GBL/GHB work on GABAb receptors) and so Baclofen (an agonist at the GABAb receptor) was also presribed to be taken 3-4 times daily. My withdrawal symptoms went and I was able to go without GBL. I continued on baclofen and 30mg valium a day for about 3 weeks and then stopped.

After being addicted to GBL you feel hollow and anxious for about a month or so afterwards. You don't feel right AT ALL...but it really does eventually go away and you DO return to normal. It is important not to take anymore GBL/GHB in this time as addiction becomes likely all over again. Diazepam certainly helps with the anxiety, but doesn't take it away.

If you are suffering from an addiction to GBL/GHB then please try to advise your doctor on the above treatment method as diazepam alone will not work.

Be careful, and good luck.</bodytext></report>
