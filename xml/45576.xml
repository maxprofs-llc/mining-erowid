I had never messed with Saliva but I had it figured for a mild buzz like sensation; may be with some early shroom like visuals. I guess because it is legal and I could have it sent to my door led me to false conclusions. From what I had read I knew it would come on strong and I would not peak for a long period of time. The site I bought it from warned me that 20x extract was going to be pretty strong stuff, so I went easy on it packing about .5 of a gram into the end of a Black and Mild. I lit the end of my Black and took three good tokes keeping the fire on it the whole time. Before I could put my cigar down I was gone. And man, I mean gone.

I don't remember the first twenty or so seconds of it, but what I do remember is seeing my room from the inside of my mouth. At this point I experienced some form of ego displacement, I wasn't myself. I was trapped inside my body but I couldnt do anything on my own. I felt like this guy has got me by the strings and I just have to follow orders. I asked my self over and over again, how did I lose controll? And more importantly who is in controll now? This is still my apartment I see my hand, but I ain't behind the wheel.  Finally I snapped out of it. I found myself leaning way over the chair I was sitting in, my body was tense. I was trying to escape. I stood up and took a look around, 'shit' I said.

It took a few minutes to get over it and by that time the mini-trip was over. Anyway, it ain't kids stuff, it sent me for a loop and I have tried pretty much everything under the sun.</bodytext></report>
