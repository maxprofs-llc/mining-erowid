I recently extracted the N,N-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT from an ounce of phalaris grass (Phalaris arundinacea var. picta, commonly known as 'tricolor ribbon grass' and sold in most garden centres). My parents had unknowingly bought the grass as an ornamental for the garden, little did they know what I'd be doing with it. I had made the grass into an acidic tea, basified the solution and then extracted the alkaloids with three small portions of diethyl ether. This was my second attempt at smoking the extract - my first trial had been a very small amount, producing threshold effects, so I knew the stuff worked. I had been interested in trying DMT for a long time, but I didn't know anyone who had even tried it, let alone having any for sale. Hence, the phalaris extract. I have experimented with many drugs - weed, mushrooms, H.B. woodrose, MDMA, MDA, MDE, meth, opium, ether, salvia, lotus, passionflower, coleus, calamus, nutmeg, absinthe, codeine, dextroamphetamine, methyl phenidate, about a dozen 'herbal highs' and of course caffeine, so I was confident I could deal with whatever DMT threw at me.

I put a small chunk of high quality weed in my bowl, and sprinkled some tan coloured crystals on top. I didn't weigh it or anything (don't we all wish we had a scale that accurate), but it was half my powder, equivalent to half an ounce of phalaris grass. I settled myself comfortably in a chair, put on some Tool and lit the bowl. The DMT melted and seemed to flow down into the weed. It must have reached the bottom of my bowl, because my last toke had a strong synthetic taste to it.  After that last toke, I was tripping quite hard. Everything in my room seemed to be expanding upwards, and it looked gleaming and alien. There was a high frequency buzzing energy in my body, and as I closed my eyes there was a loud noise as if someone had just plugged in an amplifier, accompanied by a brilliant blue flash in my vision. I heard a deep, electrical buzzing somewhere in the depths of my mind, whilst seeing a glowing blue donut shape surrounded my complicated structures of lines.

Then, out of the blackness, there emerged this little elf like creature (and at some level my mind went 'wow, DMT elves!').  The elf was spinning a three dimensional diamond shape in his hands. The diamond was filled with many more diamond shapes inside. He looked at me inquisitively for a moment, then walked through a wall of blackness and vanished. As the effects started to fade about 10 minutes after smoking, I noticed they were coming in waves. The peak of a wave felt very weird, alien, and although I was able to walk around all right I felt very disconnected from my body, like I was floating everywhere. My heart was also pounding, and I had to keep reminding myself that I would come down soon. I had no concept of time, the duration of the experience seemed timeless, like I would be in it forever. After about 20 minutes I was left in a state of stimulated euphoria, and all thoughts seemed to have been driven out of my mind.

This comedown reminded me a lot of LSA. I think the latter stages of this high would be great for meditating. I hadn't been expecting to get this level of effects from the amount of phalaris extract I used, especially since I had used a commercial strain of phalaris. The marijuana seemed to synnergize with the DMT substantially, and made the experience far more bizarre than my previous experiment. I highly recommend phalaris as an easy to obtain source of DMT.</bodytext></report>
