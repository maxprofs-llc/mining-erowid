I am at home today, thankful to be alive. Around 3pm yesterday I had dosed small amounts of GBL without any food, and went for a bike ride. I had already been sick for awhile and was kind of dehydrated. I dosed another gram or two and went to my backdoor porch to smoke a cigarette.  (~6grams in 3 hours)

I was enjoying the cool calming alcohol like buzz just chilling. The last thing I remember was trying to go back inside.

I woke up sometime in the morning strapped down to a hospital bed with a catheter in my D*** and a tube down my throat. Aparantly my parents had found me smashing my body rather loudly into the floor. I was stopped breathing, so they did CPR while the ambulance came to get me.  I spent all day at the hospital yesterday. I am covered in horrible bruises from the seizures (my left knee cap, head, eyes, lips, elbows - nothing escaped when I was seizing)

I am thankful to be alive, and I would have died if no one was around. I would have been a statistic, a little too much GBL and you may stop breathing and seize.</bodytext></report>
