There is not a whole lot of information around about this chemical, and having sampled several grams of it I'd like to summarize my experiences with it.

First of all, it is very strong, and it's quite easy to become uncomfortably stoned by eyeballing doses. Even with quite a lot of experience with marijuana, other drugs, and other cannabinoid RCs (JWH series) and a general propensity for not getting strong negative effects from them even in large doses, there have been multiple times where I have misjudged a dose of AM-2201 and been thrust into a physically uncomfortable state with massive confusion reminiscent of high doses of psychedelics as well as depersonalization. This has always resolved on its own, usually leaving me feeling physically drained, but compared to other cannabinoids, including pure JWH-018 it is very easy to overdo it with AM-2201.

That said, when taken in moderation it can provide a pretty decent cannabinoid high. Duration is relatively long compared to most of the synthetics, although I've found it leaves me more burnt out afterwards, and is somewhat stupefying. Feelings of couch lock are common but compared to THC or some of the other RC cannabinoids it doesn't seem to stimulate hunger to a very large degree. I consider it the best of the new cannabinoids that are readily available and not covered by the ban, but it definitely requires caution, and ideally a milligram scale.</bodytext></report>
