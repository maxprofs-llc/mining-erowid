In the following report, I will do my best to explain the most intense trip of my life.  First, a little background on myself.  I am 18 years old, 510, and approx. 150 lbs.  I am a high school student in good health.  I consider myself an experienced tripper and substance user.  I have only tripped LSD 2 times, but Ive tripped mushrooms over 50 times.  I have had 3, 4th plateau DXM trips and over 100 others.

About 2 weeks ago, a friend of mine got some 2c-t-7.  He told me about his trip off the substance (10 mg) and said it reminded him of a long, fun mushroom trip.  I researched the chemical and came to the conclusion that I must try it.  I hadnt taken a psychedelic in over 6 months but knew I could handle this substance.  So, I bought 2 10mg capsules and took them on my friends birthday.  The trip was amazing, however the whole night I was sitting in a car driving around which limited the trip.  I had to try it again in a more trip friendly environment.

About 2 weeks later, my parents went out of town for 2 nights, 3 days.  This was the perfect opportunity to experiment with this chemical again.  I live on the 15th and 16th floor of a building in downtown Denver, CO.  A two-story penthouse with 2 stories of glass windows looking back at the city.  A very fun place to trip.  It was Monday night at 6:15 pm when I took my 30 mg dose of 2c-t-7.  (Note: I later found out that I actually took 60 mg, not 30)

8:30 pm:  The visuals become very intense.  Vibrant, swirling patterns of color and geometric shapes overwhelm my senses.  Everything I look at is crawling and shifting.  Unlike mushrooms, my entire field of vision is moving at once.  It seems like everything in the world is moving together to form certain patterns.  It is very difficult to describe the nature of the visuals because they are so unique.

9:30 pm:  Visuals are even stronger.  If someone were to walk into my house right now, I wouldnt be able to see them or even tell that they were there.  I cant see my own hand in front of my face.  My entire field of vision is filled with fierce tracers and bursts of color.  There is a plastic, dream like feel to the world.  I was struggling with the occasional thought of a trip that I couldnt handle and feelings of nausea.  I didnt throw up and kept my trip under control for the most part.  I listen to some awesome trance music (which is my passion in life) and am utterly amazed.  My hallucinations are greatly influenced by whatever song I am listening to.  For example, everytime I heard this one song, the same weird alien face would encircle my computer screen and dance around.

10:00 pm:  I lose track of all time so this is an approximate time.  This is when shit starts to get real weird.  I look down onto my living room from the second story and on the white couch I see my parents, in their robes, sitting there.  It looks as if they are partly see-though and outlined in Christmas lights.  For some reason, this sight didnt seem too strange to me.  I remember saying, hello? and Mom?.  I went back into my den and everywhere Id go my parents would be there.  It got to the point where everything in my vision would form my parents.  Its hard to explain.

After this, I totally lost touch with reality.  I started to hear cop sirens and my phone ringing over and over.  The aural hallucinations were so vivid it was frightening.  My parents were still accompanying me everywhere I went.  I went to my neighbors, who I party with, and asked him repeatedly if he saw my parents or the cops.  He was very freaked out by my erratic behavior.  I went into the elevator and went into this crazy time loop.  Ill try to explain the experience the best I can, however it might be difficult to understand.  While I was standing in the elevator, I came to the conclusion that my entire life had been that one day.  I totally forgot that I had a life previous to that day.  My parents came into the elevator and just stared at me shaking their head.  I fell to the ground a few times and they said things like how could you do this to us.  It was like they were expecting me to do something, something that required little effort, something that I was having trouble with.  I then got this strange feeling that I was living out a normal day backwards and in slow motion.  I would think about a problem, for example my health.  I would think that I was dying and that I needed water badly, then on my way to get water remember that my parents were coming up the elevator and that I needed to solve that problem.  Id go back to the elevator, see my parents and then remember that I had to solve the problem of the cops coming to my house (they werent)  I'd talk to the hallucination of my parents trying to act normal.  This continued for at least 3 hours.  I went through the craziest mind trip.  I cant even remember most of it nor explain most of it.  At one point I was convinced that I was in the hospital and that my house, everything that I was seeing wasnt real, that it was all in my head.  I literally thought that I was laying in a hospital bed with needles in me and that I was tripping so hard that I invented myself this little world.  The thing was that I didnt know I was tripping.   I didnt know that I was human, I didnt know anything.  I didnt know that I had a life before the trip and I didnt know that I would have a life after the trip.

Eventually I came back to reality enough to realize that I would live.  I continued to trip until around 10:30 the next morning when my parents called from the town they were in asking me how my night was.  This is not a light, party drug.  A week later, my friend told me that he weighed out one of those pills and said that it was 20 mg, not 10 in one of those.  Turns out I took 60 mg, not 30.  I didnt come to any life-altering amazing conclusions.  I learned nothing about the world.  There was no euphoria, no happiness, no creative thinking.  I couldnt keep a hold of a thought long enough to express it.  I would not recommend this high of a dose to anyone.  The good thing was that I somehow kept my shit together enough to not harm myself in any way.  I can easily see someone hurting themselves on this drug however and recommend extreme caution.</bodytext></report>
