I started taking drugs just before I started going to University, and although I only managed to get hold of some weed and some mushrooms I really enjoyed the experiences. When I started living somewhere with decent dealers and a head shop down the road I decided to be a little more adventurous. I tried out LSD, MDMA, NOS and Salvia. Then one day I went in and asked the guy behind the counter if there was anything he had in that I could afford. He replied that something called MXE was selling really well and made everything a bit wobbly. I bought a pill, looked it up and took it at 10am the next morning.

Within 20 minutes things were definitely starting to change: edges seemed clearer; speaking was slightly inhibited and music seemed much more accessible. Feeling that discretion was the better part of valour, I left part of my sandwich on the plate and went up to my room with my sitter.

The next 3 hours were a wonderful transdimensional whirl during which I had a profound sense of being disconnected from the moment  as if I had taken a step back and could view my life so far at will. It was an enjoyable sensation that peaked after decided to fill up a MONSTER of a bowl about 2 hours in.

The weed moved the experience onward to a different level. For the next 90 minutes I lay comfortably in my bed and enjoyed the adventures I could have just by shutting my eyes. The effects lingered comfortably for another few hours (though I had a slight headache at one point) before dissipating entirely.

Overall, I really enjoyed high I got off MXE, and intend to give it another go at a club or party sometime to see how the synesthesia develops.

P.S Im quite aware that as I forgot to weigh the pill I cannot provide an accurate measurement. Sorry!</bodytext></report>
