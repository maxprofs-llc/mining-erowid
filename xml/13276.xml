For 3 days I repeatedly used opiates.  The pills were acquired from the depths of the medicine cabinet; leftovers from past operations and sleeping problems of my family members. I wasn't doing anything all week but hanging out around my parent's house, which is mindnumbingly dull, so the finding the pills was a joyous event.

In the afternoon I took 3 hydrocodones and 2 oxycontins.  after about 20 minutes I started feeling pretty good, and while waiting for the pills to take full affect,  I crushed a oxycontin and snorted through a cut straw and took two more hydrocodone pills and one more oxycontin.

The oxy-snuff hit me in seconds. My nose became numb and started running, and I had an extremely bad bitter taste in the back of my mouth. My head seemed to float up from my body, my hands were shaking and fidgeting like a speedfreak's, and every movement I made felt fluid and wonderful, like I was dancing in warm water. I felt happy, talkative, and hyper.  impulsively, I called up old friends from high school and college and ranted to whoever answered the phone (or their answering machine). My words sounded fast and highpitched. I couldn't control what I was saying... that is, I couldn't think before I spoke, I just thought outloud, and made some embarrassing revelations.

Eventually I decided I had frightened enough people and jumped into my bed. I took an ambien (just for the hell of it- I was definitately fucked up) now that the numerous pills had digested, I felt euphoric and inspired. I wrote pages and pages in my journal about my state of mind, by this time I was very tired (but knew it was I bad idea to go to sleep).  the entry is barely legible, but here are samples:

There is much more of this mood-swing nonsense, but it gets irritating very quickly.  this state of mind lasted from three days, in which and slowly increased the dosage of narcotics. Whenever I would start to come down, I would feel lethargic and panicked, and I would itch all over my body.  it was an itching that was UNBEARABLE: it was behind my eyes, deep in my ears, on every inch of my skin, EVERYWHERE.  The itching was all I could think about, and it would not go away. I scratched my skin raw trying.  I was also painfully constipated during and after the experience.  I was miserable, and it prompted me to take more and get high again so I wouldn't feel so bad.

I had very little experience with the recreational consumption of painkillers, and in retrospect I see that the dose I took was very dangerous. I was able to function somewhat during the experience, but I was constantly dizzy and I laughed at everything, especially at times when it inappropriate: like when I heard my cousin was in a mental ward at the hospital.

Overall I had fun, maybe a bit too much, because I really want (almost crave) to do it again, and that makes me worry.</bodytext></report>
