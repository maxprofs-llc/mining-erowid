I am a Utah Punk Rocker named Mark T. I have done a large amount of salvia in the past, and had had a bad confrontation with my shadow. Today I did another large dose, and this is how is went down.

It loaded to be 2 big bowls in a water bong, and I got em down in 1 hitter bowls. With my eyes open, I saw nothing, but felt confused and in complete disoray. I closed my eye only to meet a full in closed eye hullicination. The fuzzy light of my closed eyes manipulated and duplicated, I was in complete darkness in another deminsion and in a cell of a firey square as it was all around. A fire being came and grabbed my and threw me down, forced me back into this dimension, I open my eyes and still see darkness, and my sitter outlined in fire. I told him that my lungs hurt. I was sprirling in a bad trip. Trying to get out of my trip but that pain was a firey chain connected to my soul, squeezing and confining it. I was completely out the top of my head connected with the cosmic consiosness, thats all there was. I felt disturbed thinking that everything was an illusion, that I was a slave to the darkness and everyone was a boring dream.

I realized that this was my shadow again. So I pushed it away, I denied the lies that it put in me. I told myself the concept of reality, while physically forcing the firey chain around my soul off, reaching towards the lady that it was that forced me down. After reality hit I was hit with feeling of boredom and disconnection with the family that I was with that I was so close to in the past. Then the darkness came flashing back and I was confined back into my firey cell. I finally told the shadow that what I felt towards them was not boredom, but a strong bond and longing towards.

The lady came back and took my hand, she pulled off the pain in my lungs and took the chain from me and carried me back into reality. I reassured myself of where I was and grasped back the concept that I was not really alone, I could feel the aura of the others upstairs and there I went, I came down and back into my body that somehow I became disassociated with and back to reality that I had so been longing. And most of all, I had defeated my long troubling shadow. Before I had a trip where my shadow took over my body and suppressed my in the painfull was as now. Before it threw me back as I could feel the dark cloud overtake me, then I came to.

I don't think that I will do anymore salvia, because I feel that I have done what I had been wanting to.</bodytext></report>
