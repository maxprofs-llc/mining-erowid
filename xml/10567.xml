I used to work as a chemist for a specialty compressed gas corporation. Before we could afford a compressor we had to just vent transfers of highly expensive rare gases such as krypton and xenon from filling manifolds to the outside air. (1 cylinder containing 50cu foot of xenon ~1400 liters currently sells for ~$20,000).

Having been curious about the vocal distortive effects of helium, I decided to vent a xenon manifold into my lungs. What a head-rush, the large size of a xenon atom apparently displaces oxygen quite readily. (I was standing by an emergency oxygen supply in case I felt I was going to pass out). The buzzed feeling only lasted for ~5min following a single deep breath of Xe. The buzz was only 1/4 the fun however. If one sings tenor, prepare to sing contra-bass; I found myself singing 'were so sorry Uncle Albert, but we havent done a bloody thing all day' about 2 octaves down from my normal register to a coworker. We laughed our asses off.

It's almost worth smashing a strobelight or other xenon filled apparatus to try it again.

NOTE: There are other nontoxic gases which provide this vocal effect: carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoroethane, perfluoropropane &amp; sulfur hexafluoride; they are about 1000% cheaper. (I would be sure to have an emergency O2 supply nearby,or better yet prepare a mixture of at least 17 vol% O2 with a balance of any of the aforementioned gases; I also find O2/N2O mixes are also great fun and safer than pure nitrous.)  /n
