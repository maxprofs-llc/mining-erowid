I already knew it was going to be a great night my parents were out of town.  I had a fat sack of herb a gram of that white girl and a lot of alcohol.  A friend of a friend came over and was like 'Thanks for having me over I got these pharmies if you want them.'  Of course I cant deny free pills.  So he brought down a huge bottle of 200mg. Seroquel.  I was very interested because I have never taken them.  He could not stress the fact enough to only take a quarter of the 200mg. pill.  I put it in my pocket and continued to party.

It got really late or really early (5a.m.).  I needed to go to sleep but I was geeked out.  So me and my partner in crime decide we want to pass out.  I split the Seroquel into 4ths and me and my friend took about 50mg. each.  I was skeptical at first but after about 30-45 min. I was slurring my words and felt like my feet had weights attached to them.  I continued to drink and do more lines.  I usually rely on cocaine to bring me out of what ever slump I am in.   Oh no not this time! I would do a line and the seroquel start to release me but 10 min later I was in the same spot.  Fucked up!!</bodytext></report>
