I am a twenty year old male sophmore in college, and I've tried many drugs over the past year and a half.  After trying at least all of the major drugs during this time at least once, I have recently began trying combinations of drugs.  I began the new year with a resolution to try to build and maintain a well stocked and diverse drug hoarde.  However, after only a month later, I realized that doing this and maintaining my pet mushroom growing project was prohibitively expensive.

So instead I decided to just hoarde enough for a mind blowing evening.  After procurring a tablet of ectasy, red, with Voltzwagon marquis, a tablet of adderall, a gram of some nice cannabis, about a dozen poppy bulbs, and about a gram of my home grown fungi. I kept my eyes open for an oppurtunity to present itself so that I could consume the aforementioned substances.  The problem with having a hoarde of drugs is the constant temptation to say 'fudge it' and take them for the sake of taking them.

The oppurtunity happened to be a Dieselboy show at a local club.  I enjoy dieselboy (drum and bass) and was pumped to attend a show.  I have only been to two other concerts/shows, the Green Day/Blink 182 show and Iced Earth.  Needless to say punk and heavy metal shows are nothing like the show I went to, which was basically the best excuse for a rave my crappy little city had to offer.  On the way to the show I popped the E, adderall, and shrooms, which I washed down about a half hour before the show started.  Next a joint was smoked prior to entering the club with 4 of my best freinds.

We entered the club blatantly high.  The show had already started and we made our way through the throngs of people on the dance floor.  My freinds went ahead of me, and the first waves of paranoia due to being in a somewhat unfamiliar place with lights, noise, and confusion took me aback at first.  I spent the first five minutes or so standing back near the entrance, observing the scene, and looking for my freinds who had already dispersed through the crowd.  I slowly made my way to the opposite end of the club, and caught up with my freinds.  We staked out a spot near the edge of the crowd, and just chilled for a little while as we got our bearing and bobed our heads to the music.

I slowly began dancing, and the ice started to melt.  Soon my one freind J, busted a lil break dancing move.  To my suprise, the area we were dancing in became the circle where the really good breakers began to do their stuff.  The breakers were amazing and I couldn't help but smile, clap, and say 'Oh shit!' to the better moves.  By now the drugs were starting to kick in and I felt a nice body buzz and positive synergy from them. 
/n

At that time my freind J picked a quarter up off of the floor that one of the breakers had kicked out of the circle.  He picked it up and palmed it to me, and I slyly put it in my pocket.  The next thing I know a plain clothes security dude came up from behind me and started digging through my pockets.  I knew better than to have drugs in my front pockets and he didn't find anything on me.  After explaining that the object was a quarter and emptying out my front pockets, he left saying 'That was a really shady move dude.'  This killed my buzz for the next ten minutes, but what can I say, shady people like us do shady things.

The first 45 minutes after entering the club (About 1:15 minutes after dosing) I hit my first peak of the night.  I really began to dance in earnest, and had found myself next to two members of the opposite sex that I joined with.  I desired to talk to them but the music was to loud to carry on any sort of conversation.  I felt many of my inhibitions fall away, yet I still didn't have the courage to take them aside to talk to them.  So I continued to dance with them anyways, which I couldn't stop doing, I didn't even think about stopping to take a break most of the night.  
/n

The body buzz was excellent, and I felt like I had more energy than I've had in almost two years, that being my high school football and sports days, when I was active, before I started dabbling with drugs.  Ironically high school sports burned me out more than the drugs, after high school I vowed not to join any team sports in college, not because I didn't play, just the fact that I played too much and was sick of the demands it put on my life.  Anyways I began to see purple trails underneath moving lights and objects, and my heart was racing, due to the amphetamines.

About an hour and a half hours into the show, the weed buzz had all but wore off, and the mushrooms effects began to show through.  The body load started to detract from the 'X'perience.  I began to feel heavier and started to slow down.  At about this time the two females were joined by a third younger girl.  This third girl became my guardian angel.  She payed me more attention than the other two did, and began feeding me ice cubes and water, which I had neglected to drink because I didn't want to stop dancing to get some.
/n

Needless to say I started dragging and feeling like it was the fourth quarter of a long and hard fought football game.  Her timing couldn't have been better, because I was starting to recognize the signs of overexertion anyways.  I also had the pleasure of getting cold water sprayed into my face by her spitting it at me.  This felt wonderful the first couple times she did so, and was the closest thing to the hyper sensitivity I felt since when I rolled for the first time last year.  This E-pill, only being my second was speedy and gave me a nice rush and good feelings, but I did not get some of the sensations that I did when I rolled last year.  I gave the girl a piece of gum, and my freind R showed up.  From that point on he kept me well hydrated as I danced the night away.

About 2:30 hours into the show I really did start to feel run down and low on energy.  So I decided to pop the caffeine pill I had hidden in my cargo pants pocket.  I continued to dance, and about a half hour after the pill I got my second wind, and managed to finish dancing to the dieselboy set with a strong finish, and a nice amount of energy.  My freinds and I left the show after the dieselboy set, although another DJ was still going for another hour. Because they weren't as into the show or messed up as I was, and they were semi-anxious to leave the show.  I would have liked to have stayed longer, but I felt that the caffeine probably wouldn't last much longer, my freinds wouldn't want to, and the show would be wrapping up soon anyways.  So we headed out once more to our homes, wherever they are, smoking a joint on the ride there.
/n

The joint and exhaustion caught up with me, and I was soon sound asleep after arriving at my place.  However, three hours later I was awakened by the phone.  I managed to get another hour of sleep, but then woke up for good for the rest of the day.  The weird thing was that even though I was tired and worn out from the night before, I still had a reserve of energy from god knows where.  It sort of felt like the energy you get prior to crashing for a very long time.
/n

I also believe I've had my first actual flashback the next day as well.  I couldn't get the music from the other night out of my head for most of the day, and when I was sitting in the cafeteria for breakfast, I closed my eyes, and I was transported back into the club!  This was the first time this had ever happened to me, so I was so shocked that I recoiled in suprise and worry. The experience didn't last very long, only about a second or two.  I would say I felt unnerved, but it was pretty cool and I wished it would have lasted longer.  
/n

That day I also smoked the weed leftover from the other night twice that day, and about dinner time I began to have a pounding headache set in, from last nights noise, the weed comedown, and probably the aftermath of taking mind altering substances.  I decided to remedy this by brewing some poppy tea from 8 bulbs to ease the pain.  However, three hours later I still had the headache, even though I was feeling medicated.  So I took two generic tylenols and a centrum. An hour later the headache was gone.  I don't know whether to attribute this to the vitamins or the tylenol, but in either case the pain was gone.  I then crashed around 11pm, and didn't wake up till three o clock the next day.

Conclusions:
/n
One of the best times of my life.  I've tripped harder, I've felt better body buzzes, but I've never felt so alive as that night.  I would definiteally recommend taking another stimulant with E if you plan on dancing the night away, HOWEVER!!!  I have used amphetamines like Adderall before and know how much to safely take.  I think that if I'm doing E and plan on dancing I will NOT to take mushrooms, lsd, or other psychedelics.  They may make things more interesting visually, but the body load got annoying and can make dancing difficult and unenjoyable.</bodytext></report>
