I was prescribed lexapro, abilify, and klonopin by my psychiatrist. After years of being on the medications I stopped getting any soothing effects. I've always had a thing for snorting pills so I decided to take my average 2mg dose of abilify and up it to 6mg (which is still a very low dose.) Almost immediately after snorting I begin to feel a buzzing sensation in my body and working its way downward. It gave me a slight aroused sensation, and it was like my mind was moving very fast. Overall it is a pleasant buzz, but be careful with the dosage. I may try again in gradual upgrades.</bodytext></report>
