I consider myself an experienced Opiate user. Having taken almost every Prescription based drug in hopes of a Euphoric experience. Never having a bad experience, the thought of my shiny new Tylenol 3 prescription made me orgasmic. I recieved this prescription due to a pretty severe toothache. Seconds after leaving the dentists office I had 12 T3's in my possesion. I decided that I would wait until I got home before I took this new endeavor on.

Like all my other Opiate experiences I usually wait until late at night, 10:30 or so. Mainly because there are less distractions and enjoyability is increased.

Time ticked away and eventually so did 10:30. Gulp. 6 Pills downed.

180MG codeine is now settling in my stomache. My virgin stomache now has enough codeine in it to hopefully give me a -very- intense trip, I could never have been farther from the truth.

A new sort of feeling is coming over my body. Not like the Hydrocodone feelings I am used to. This is more subtle, almost like Marijuana. I do things, like turn my head, and wonder if I actually did it. Slowly my body becomes warm and cozy, a smile creeps on my face and I am happy.

I am lying in my bed with my now sleeping girlfriend. I am listening to her breath and I suddenly realize that she is breathing normal compared to me. I am taking very short breaths. Then I remember reading about OD symptoms and that is one of them. Yet, I did not take enough of to justify an OD. The thought doesnt help, panic sets in. I think I am od'ing.

The shallow breathing is now being forced. I have to force the Oxygen into my lungs. I am in the midst of a severe panic attack. I don't know what to do. I wake my girlfriend up and explain it to her. She convinces me that I am not od'ing that I am manifesting the symptoms. She could be right. I decide to go outside.

I have been walking around outside for awhile now, everything seems ok. When I don't think about my breathing I am ok. I decide to try and enjoy this experience. I go back inside and lay back down with my Angel. I lay there for quite some time, falling in and out of sleep. Then I get up to go to the bathroom. When I begin to open the door to the bathroom I realize I am trying very hard to turn the handle. Pushing the door open seems impossible. Fatigue. OD symptom #2. Panic attack #2. I hate codeine now.

12:20.

After walking around some more outside I realize that I am not really fatigued, just a bit tired. I decide to let myself go to sleep so I head back in the house and lay down once more. Drifting in and out of consciousness, my thoughts are flooded with the most obscene images. The second I close my eyes I have visions of a strange old lady with two crayons in her hand, screaming. I can't take this, eyes open.

12:44.
/n
After 20 minutes of fighting sleep I can't control it anymore. I fight off the strange thoughts and let myself drift off into happy sober land. Severe pain in my stomache. My lungs. My chest. OD symptom #3. Codeine is the devil. I lay there with my new OD symptoms and realize that i will never partake of the codeine again. Sleeping.

I wake up, look at the clock, realize that the drug has already peaked and I have not died. I lived. I experienced. Goodnight.</bodytext></report>
