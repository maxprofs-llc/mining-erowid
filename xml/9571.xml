i made the ether by purchasing starter fluid and spraying it into a glass. i then added water and drained off the bottom layer with a turkey baster. i poured a tiny bit on a  rag and than began huffing. i was immediatly reminded of the time i tried amyl nitrate in europe. i huffed about 4 rags and had the strangest trip of my life. the vegetables in the garden would all buzz a different tone and sounded like they were talking. i tripped on other stuff but i cant remember any of it. i had no hallucinations and than i started to feel sick to my stomach. i went to bed and didnt sleep but lied down and felt better 45 minutes later. worth trying again for the crazy trips in my head. ill definitly have some gravol on hand for the nausea though.</bodytext></report>
