With this report, I hope to dispel any confusion about the effects of smoking magic mushrooms.  Smoking the mushrooms plain, in a regular pipe will not really produce any effects worth noting, and the flavor of the smoke is very unenjoyable.  However, filling a bong bowl with half weed, and half dried mushrooms can result in a very enjoyable experience.  The addition of weed, and the water involved, gets rid of the gross taste, and only leaves you with a nice earthy and distinctly mushroom flavor.  And the resulting inebriation, is a lot more extreme than smoking them plain, or in a pipe.

After about 4 hits each, me and my friend felt so intoxicated that there wasn't really a huge desire to smoke any more.  Visually it is no where near as intense as ingesting them, but the body high is nice and you feel significantly more jacked up than you would from just weed.  I hope this helps, and more people try this because it is definitely worth it.</bodytext></report>
