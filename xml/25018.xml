Well it all started 1 week ago, I was walking around with some friends in a subway/mall and one of them stopped to go to the bathroom at a fast-food restaurant. While they were waiting I walked to a nearby pharmacy to buy a bag of candy. While I was walking around the isle's I saw boxes of No-Doz, Vivarian and some other caffeine supplements. I was tired and bored so I said what the hell and bought the cheapest ones ('Stay Awake' brand) 36 tablets (200MG each) for $4 bucks.

I took 2 and in 30 minutes I was wide awake. I felt great but it came with a price, I was staring off people in the train, pushing and shoving people out of my way, acting like a A*hole lol.. My cousin (M) came by a few hours later, since I was going on vacation to florida the next day, me and him agreed to go for a all nighter. It was about 1 oclock and I started feeling tired and sleepy so I went and got my 'Stay Awake' tablets and showed them to my cousin.

I convinced him to try it, he took 1 tablet and I took 2. We sat back, turned on the TV (this was in the complete darkness. After about 30 minutes (1:30AM) we started getting peppy, I felt like talking a lot of bullshit and moving around for no reason. (M) heard a noise so we quickly turned off the TV (If we made too much noise we would wake up our mom and she would probably send us to separate rooms). So we started talking about telepathy, I said that if we concentrate on an object long enough we can cause it to move, disintegrate, burst into flames ect. We both agreed to imagine ourselves pressing the ON button on the cable box to turn it on.

After staring at it for 5 minutes I started to see what I can only explain as a vortex of energy surrounding my vision flowing to the cable box. A few minutes after the only thing I could see was the vortex and the energy flowing to the button of the cable box, everything else was a blur. 30 minutes later (about 2:15AM) (M) called my name, I got so scared I jumped off seat. I told him I had to piss but he didn't let me go (he didnt want me to wake up my mom) so I went to the kitchen filled 2 8oz cups full of piss and threw them out the window.

He laughed for a while then told me that what we were doing sucked and that he was falling asleep. So me and (M) took another tablet, (M) was up to 400MG and I was 1000MG. After about 20 minutes I started to see glitch like hallucinations (semi-translucent squares and triagles popping un in my vision) and when I would close my eyes I would see this glowing red square and little particles flowing out of it.

I stared at that for what seemed like 10 minutes (which was actually about 2 hours). I started getting sleepy again so I took 2 more tablets (M) refused and said that he was fine with the dosage he took. (I was up to 1600MG total, 4:30AM)

After 20 minutes the Glitches became more bold and pronounced and when I would stare at the walls I would see little sparkles of light and wavy smoke come out of them. When I closed my eyes saw myself in different places then I had a hallucination about myself peeping at a bunch of naked girls in a shower, it was as clear as High Definition TV, it felt like I was really there, I even felt the humidity of the steamy shower. Then I heard a mumbled blur of my name so I opened my eyes, (M) was lying out on the other side of the couch so it couldn't of been him. 
/n

I was scared so I tapped (M) and he told me he was still awake, we started looking at the shadows coming from the window which formed this man-like pig. I looked to the left where the TV was and started thinking about things that happened earlier that day and thats when it happened, imagine a light 1000 times brighter than the sun floating a few inches in front of the TV and a smaller super bright light right next appearing for a few seconds and then disappearing into nothing. I was left speechless, I asked (M) if he saw it too and he said that he saw a light in the corner of his eye (I was sitting at the left of the couch and he was at the right, he was staring at the shadows to the right and I was looking straight ahead to the TV).
/n

It was 5:08AM when this happened, I turned on the light since it was still dark and looked around the room multiple times to look for what caused it. I found nothing. How could we both have seen the same thing? was it a demon, an angel or a vision of God himself. Who knows.  I probably will never know.

I walked to the bathroom scared shitless, when I was sitting on the toilet, I stared at the carpet and saw little sparkles coming out of every thread, then wavy smoke rising from it and a feeling of falling and being sucked into the floor. It was a great experience but the after effects sucked. Me and (M) felt like shit and nauseous the next day and I was dragging ass all the way to the airport.

It's a week later and I still see wavy smoke coming out of objects if I stare at them. Freaky shit. I have a profound respect for this substance now, dont know if Ill try it again.</bodytext></report>
