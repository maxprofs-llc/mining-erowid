I've been drinking 4-6 cups of strong coffee since I've been 12. I was totally unaffected by caffeine, have no problems to fall asleep even when I have taken 3 strong cups in the hours before.

A few weeks ago I decided to quit just to see what happens. Quitting was no problem, I didn't have any problems to start going in the morning or fall asleep during the day.

However, I have noticed that recently I do react strongly to caffeine, which is really useful. When doing something, such as a long car drive for 8 hours uninterrupted, that I might have problems with to stay awake, I can now take just 1 cup of coffee and not get sleepy anymore.

Summary: if I want to benefit from caffeine, I just take it when I need it.</bodytext></report>
