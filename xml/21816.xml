I suppose I should start with my history, to help bring you into my mind. My most extensive psychoactive substance experience has been with marijuana, for a little over 4 years now. I have consumed alcohol, but extremely infrequently, perhaps 10 times in my entire life. This past two years I have delved into the world of magic and an important part of that world seemed to be psychedelics and hallucinogens. The true hallucinogens (Mandrake, Datura, Nightshade, Henbane, etc.) interested me greatly but I wisely decided to begin with psychedelics (LSD, Peyotyl, Oliliuqui, Mushrooms, etc.) to expand my mind so that I would be prepared to truly hallucinate.

I began with a few Salvia sessions, one intense but short Calea dream night, and a very light but absolutely wonderful mushroom trip at the end of summer. After that I had no access to anything illegal besides marijuana for 6 months, so I looked into the legal drugs. Nutmeg was readily available, and I experimented extensively upon myself and others with that incredibly powerful substance. After that came a few DXM trips, never more than a 4 ounce bottle of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough. And finally, after discovering that Morning Glory seeds were similar to LSD and also available at any store, I decided to give them a try as well. It took quite a while to remember to look for them, but once I did, it was a simple $10 purchase away.

My first experiment was ill-informed - I ate 1.5 grams of Flying Saucer seeds whole, but mixed with applesauce for some reason. I think I chewed at least most of them a little bit, but they had almost no effect, or at least no noticeable one other than a bit of nausea.
/n

My second experiment was only half as ill-informed - I ground 9 grams of Pearly Gates seeds up in a coffee grinder, then put them in cold water mixed with some pure lemon juice, and let them sit in the refrigerator for an hour or so. I left the seed mush in, and it settled into three layers: one light greenish, one darker green/yellow with small chunks, and one greyish with most of the seed chunks. At 3:00 pm, I started to drink it. I made it through the first layer and a little bit of the second before the taste made me feel nauseous. The mix of lemon juice and the seeds was awful to say the least.

After this I had a sickening feeling in my stomach which did not go away for the rest of the night. This was accompanied by a 'body high' that was more like a body low, I felt like I had sea-sickness, even though I've never really had sea-sickness, I assume this is what it feels like. I have vomited perhaps 4 times in my whole life, always from extreme sickness. Within 45 minutes of drinking the morning glory seed water I barely made it to the toilet in time to puke up everything I've ever eaten in my whole life, and then some. Miserable feeling. And the 'trip' wasn't a trip, it was mostly just a body feeling. I decided that next time I would do the ritual fasting, eat ginger, and smoke a small amount of marijuana as precautions against the intense nausea.

My third, and I believe successful trip, went as follows - On Thursday I thoroughly washed 9 grams of Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds with Dawn dishwashing liquid in a collander, and then rinsed those 9 grams extremely thoroughly but being careful not to let the seeds soak at all. I then set them on a paper towel under the stove fan to dry. After 30 minutes or so they were dry, and I ground them up in a coffee-bean grinder. After collecting 99% of the powder, I transferred it to a large cup which I had filled with applesauce. I stirred it in thoroughly so that it was well mixed, and then I left it in my refrigerator. This was at approximately noon. From then on I did not eat anything that day, I stayed up late, and went to sleep rather tired. 
/n
/n
At 11:30 am on Friday, I awoke, and rather spontaneously decided to consume the applesauce at noon. I took a shower and cleansed myself, got dressed in comfortable clothes, and went downstairs. I drank the applesauce infusion of Morning Glory seeds at noon, as I had decided 30 minutes before. I was alone, and would be until 4:00 pm or so, at which point I would be with my family for the rest of the evening. This was not the best setting to be in while tripping, and my mindset was reasonable, although not the best either, but like I said it was a spontaneous decision and nothing drastic had happened during my last to experiments.
/n
/n
So at noon I ate a small amount of raw dried ginger root (gross stuff) and then ate the applesauce, which 98% masked the seed taste (very good, it's not a nauseating taste to me). Sometime within the next hour I noticed a was a bit giggly at the computer, and I was thinking a bit oddly, which isn't unusual for me, but it was noticeable. Approximately 1:00pm I felt disoriented and kind of like 'What what the fuck is going on?' but not really in that much of a bad way. I stumbled out to the garage to smoke a small quantity of marijuana (really small, like a quarter of a bowl), still mostly in control of my thoughts and actions.

I wandered back inside, after getting semi-lost walking around my house because all of the doors were locked except for the original one I had exited from. I stepped in mud, and got kind of confused as to how to deal with this unpleasant mini-crisis. I ended up brushing most of it off in the grass in my front yard and stumbling back into the house. I felt somewhat in a fog, and I had nausea, but it was minor, thanks to the weed mostly. 
/n

I was bored, but in a kind of depressed way. I craved social interaction and knew that there was none to be had. I wanted to be with someone else who was tripping, but no one was. I couldn't even tell anyone I was tripping. But nobody would be there to tell for 4 hours anyway. For most of those 4 hours I felt slightly nauseous, but it was minimal and I felt no need or desire to puke, especially if I lay down in one spot for a while.
/n
/n
I decided watching a movie would be good for keeping me entertained while I lay down and wait for the nausea to dissipate. I put Not Another Teen Movie in, lay down on the couch, and watched it. It took about an hour longer than it should have because I would rewind it every scene at some point because I wanted to check if things I had seen in the background were real (they were) and during the musical number I rewound it and watched it ten times, maybe more, because one part was absolutely hilarious and one part was beautiful.
/n
/n
By the time the movie was done my family was almost home. I was feeling extremely spaced out and foggy, and I spent an hour laying on the couch looking at the wall and ceilings, which now had patterns on them, not particularly 'trippy' patterns, but very obvious, noticeable, realistic patterns, which changed over the course of the day, depending on what I was thinking about. Also, the sun shining through the window made a tiny rainbow on the wall (prism effect) which was incredibly cool and interesting to me. 
/n
/n
Things got a bit harder to deal with when I had to interact with people. When my family finally got home around 4, my mind was fully transformed into the brain of someone who is clinically insane. I felt like my thought had been changed from mostly linear to mostly random. I could follow conversations somewhat, but my insights and comments were 'random' and 'off-the-wall' to everyone else. They made sense, but the path I followed to get to my conclusions was completely erratic.
/n
/n
The jokes I made were funny, but only to me, because half of the joke was something I was thinking about at the time. I solved this problem of sounding like an insane person whenever I opened my mouth by not talking as much as possible. The simplest comments, like 'Thank you,' were odd and awkward-sounding to me, so I tried to avoid people. Most of the time I felt like I was watching the world from about ten feet behind my eyes, and I could 'reconnect' when I needed to but I was still a bit distanced from typical reality.
/n
/n
The whole time I felt alone and was somewhat depressed that I didn't have anyone to share this experience. I thought a lot about the fact that I didn't have any huge passion in life or definite direction to go. Normally this is liberating to me, but the Morning Glory seeds liberated my mind so much that it wanted and needed something solid to anchor it. I had nothing, no solid goal, no driving purpose. And when I was lost in the land of infinity that my Friday night had become, this was scary and depressing. It is definitely a daytime drug, unlike shrooms. I have never actually used a sitter, but I have tripped with people and I enjoy it immensely, being a very social person.

By about 8:00 pm I was ready to go to sleep just to escape the madness. Literally I had gone crazy, but not extremely crazy, and I knew it. I didn't want to be crazy alone, and it was unpleasant as hell to know that until I was done being crazy, I was alone. Truly alone, because the thing that binds us together as a society is the fact that generally, we think alike. We assume at least some of the same things, and act usually in the same way in response to stimuli.
/n
/n
Well I was off in another world, thinking much differently from anyone around me, with all the oddities of behavior that this entails. I wanted to go to sleep and wake up sane again, with some kind of self-certainty about my life path. Once in bed, I noticed something which was absent (aside from the wall/ceiling patterns) during the light part of the trip. In mostly darkness, things began to have colors that I knew weren't their real colors.
/n
/n
It was subtle, but my walls were blueish and greenish and a poster I have of a black and white fingerprint began pulsing and swirling, in a subtle manner as well. The colors swirled a bit too, and the ceiling patterns gained some colors at this point as well. I believe I began to notice the colors because of the minimal light, and the colors were by no means bright or vibrant. As a matter of fact, they reminded me of the voices I 'heard' while under the influence of Salvia Divinorum: I didn't really 'hear' the voices, I just knew in my mind that the voices existed, and what they were saying. In this same manner I 'knew' that there were colors, and my eyes tried to catch up and show me these colors, but it wasn't a vibrant or intense knowledge, so the colors were subtle. Interesting nonetheless though, since I have yet to try LSD or have enough mushrooms to truly alter the colors and perspective much, and the morning glory seeds did this, albeit only minorly.

I woke up at 3 in the morning, which was the first time I knew I had fallen asleep. My thoughts had slipped into hypnagogia, and my hypnagogia into dreams, so I woke up at 3 rather surprised that I had been asleep. I checked my eyes in the mirror, they weren't dilated any more but I still felt a bit off baseline, kind of an after-effect. I went back to sleep and woke up the next morning feeling better, but with the knowledge burned into my head that this was a trip that I should take with friends and during the day next time.
/n

The best way to describe what I felt like during the whole trip was 'insane', not minorly so, but severely insane. I was crazy. I had taken a trip into a world of madness from which I could not escape. The world appeared so simple and yet so unfathomably complex to me. I was crazy, and I knew it. Morning Glory seeds are not a toy, I got the feeling during the trip that the spirit contained in the seed experience is an old and harsh one. It was definitely male, with two sides. He is hell on my stomach and body. The mental voyage is fantastic. It is not hard to gain entrance into the world of Oliliuqui. It simply requires intelligence.</bodytext></report>
