   When I received the gram of AMT in the mail, I was surprised to find that a gram is much smaller than you think it would be- when the average starter dose would be one fiftieth of the small package. It was almost two inches long, half an inch wide, and only a few millimeters tall.

   Obviously, measuring the dose by eye would be difficult, especially when too much probably would ruin the first trip. However, I carried on, unable to measure well. Squares of graph paper were too big, but I ended up measuring the clear package with a ruler. Then, I drew the rectangle on a paper that represented the 1/50th of the gram (which is 20mg). Obviously, my measurement could have been off by 5 or 10mg, and it was not until after a few more AMT experiences (and reading about other's on erowid) until I knew my first dose was a bit under 20mg.

   I took a quarter of this small portion, and insufflated (nose) it. The burn took me aback, which was worse than half a crushed MDMA pill. It lasted longer than I expected, and I was extremely glad I did not try to take the full amount that way. I could tell from walking around that there was an immediate, yet light effect. I thought it was similar to half a shot of hard alcohol.

   I mixed the remainder of the dose in juice, and drank it. The smell of AMT made me expect a chemical taste worse than alcohol, so I chased the mix with more juice. I decided to work on my setting (I was already alone, expecting no one, and the day was well into the night), so I found a blanket, made a glass of water, and started watching a humorous show.

   Most people's experiences mentioned nausea, which was a side effect I only got from alcohol, but I expected it anyway. It was a good hour later before I noticed any effect. Things just at the edge of my vision caught my eye, as though something had just moved. I had this effect from the come-up of my experience with mushrooms. I stared at the chair across the room, and expected it to move in some fashion. I suddenly realized that it was much closer than it should be- yet, it was still up against the wall. When I blinked, it was 'back' where it belonged, but if I stared at it, it would appear to come closer, without moving away from the wall. I knew the effect was due from how eyes can judge the distance of something, with how 'crossed' they are; but, it was still neat.

   Then the nausea set in. It was not the sort where you feel like you need to throw up, but it was close enough that I thought it could turn that way easily. I realized that I had just ate a bunch of cookies before taking the AMT. Luckily, I only had a stomachache throughout the trip, rather than nausea. I theorize that this side effect is caused by the chemical similarity of AMT to serotonin, and that serotonin is needed for digesting.

   Half an hour later, I noticed colors were brighter, and sure enough, my pupils were very dilated. Straight edges, such as corners of walls, wavered and shifted. If I watched the ceiling, it would slowly move around, detached from the walls. I could see patterns in the bumps and ridges, and every time I blinked, they would be different. Seeing the patterns was similar to seeing shapes or animals in clouds. The area in the center of my vision was always a pattern like that of an asterisk (*). Wherever I looked, I could see the asterisk made of bumps or grooves- even in the carpet or wood furniture.

   One very noticeable effect was my thinking. It was simply hyperactive. As an example: As I was watching a movie, one of the actors said a line. Next, I'd start thinking about how many ways the actor could say that line, and how many times the actors had to re-act the scene before it was satisfactory. I wouldn't even be done with that thought before I started wondering about how the scriptwriter or author imagined how the scene would look- what the actors would look like, etc. Then, I was suddenly thinking about the entire movie making process, and how someone with just a script starts this process by talking with a producer- and how exciting it would be if I was an author and it was being made into a movie. Then, another actor said a line, and I realized I had all these thoughts within just a couple minutes.

   After a couple movies, my high was still going strong. I vacated to my room when I heard my roommate?s alarm go off. I attempted to sleep, but my restless thoughts kept me awake. The oddest thing was that I was seeing my thoughts, like how a person sees a dream (that is, not with the eyes, but with the mind). I wasn't quite in control of my thoughts, and I watched it like a television. Remembering, none of it made sense. Random scenes or sounds would flash through my thoughts.

   I watched two more movies, and I tried to sleep again. Luckily, I was tired enough from having stayed up for 36 hours, that I just passed out. Throughout the next day, I was feeling off. I had missed a couple meals, but I did not feel hungry. I knew from my physical weakness that I had to eat something. I shoved some crackers and cereal down on what felt like a full stomach.

   Comparisons:

   MDMA: Many experiences compare the first hour of the high to MDMA, but it felt more like a rush of energy and euphoria. Somewhat similar to a small dose of methamphetamine.

   Mushrooms: I knew both psilocybin and AMT were chemically similar, and it wasn't until after another mushroom experience before I could tell the similarities. Unfortunately, it's hard to describe the differences. I guess AMT's hallucinations are more flat, whereas mushrooms are more 3D.

   Conclusion:
/n
   The only problem I have with AMT is that the high lasts so long, and it suppresses appetite so that I do not eat enough. I have passed out once, almost twice. Do keep that in mind.</bodytext></report>
