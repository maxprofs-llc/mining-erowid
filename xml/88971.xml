Ok so this has happened to me 3 times now. My friends and I rip a bowl out of a really nice bong and we are just chilling, they are all high but I'm tripping like crazy. I start hallucinating the same thing, where everything I see is a flickering rough outline of its shape in all different colors with a black backdrop.

This is the third time this has happened and it really freaks me out. Every time I blink I hear the sound of an old television turning off. In the most recent one I thought that my lips were made of peanut butter and when I rubbed them I thought I was rolling the dough up into little balls. It sounds cool but its more scary. At first I thought it was laced, but none of my friends are hallucinating or anything.</bodytext></report>
