I hit the pipe hard, taking as much as I can until I start to 'weed cough'. I hold it for 20 seconds, and then hit it again just as hard. Starting to feel 'something', a mild tingling feeling. I set the pipe and lighter down, put my head back and close my eyes. The tingling feeling lasts 15 seconds then, nothing. I open my eyes and look around. Nothing, nothing happened. I relay my experience to my friend sitting across from me on the couch. He is my 'sitter' for the evening, and he will also be taking a written record of my experience.

Disappointed with my results with the 5x, I pull the 20x from my pocket. I fill the bowl plump full. I take a monster toke. I hold this one for maybe 10 seconds, exhale, and then I suck-down another. Again, I set the pipe and lighter down, put my head back and close my eyes. Something is definitely happening. The familiar tingling sensation is back, but more intense. I start to get the feeling that I am falling backward into complete darkness. After a few seconds, BAMB! What I can only describe as the 'warp-speed' effect. Like that scene in Star Wars where the Millennium Falcon makes the jump to light speed.

** Commentary ** -- At this point in my experience, I am aware that I exist, but I don't understand my relationship between where I am at that given point in time, and where I am in the physical world. In other words, I am completely unaware that I am actually sitting in a chair at a friend's house, and not traveling at the speed of light.

Moments later, my 'warp-speed' travel comes to an instantaneous stop. Now I find my self as a child standing in the middle of the kitchen in the house I grew up in. I look up, and I immediately recognize my mother with my sister standing next to her. While I am a child in this vision, both my mother and sister appear to be the same age as they are in the real world.

My mother and sister tower over me as I look at them. They both have a goldish/white light emitting from them. The background is a brilliantly bright and warm white light, yet comfortable to the eyes. I stand in awe at the site of these two giant angelic women. They smile down at me. I get the feeling there are others looking down at me. I can't see there faces, but I know they are there.

I look behind me and notice the kitchen floor is starting to swirl, morphing into what looks like a black hole. Suddenly my legs begin to melt into the floor. I am stuck, and I am being drawn into the black hole. I franticly try to break free of the floor, but it's useless. I am both melting and being drawn into a black hole. Now I feel very frightened. I look at my mother and sister, and they are both still there smiling down at me. I reach for them with my arms begging for help, but they do nothing. My cries for help quickly turn to screams of fear, as the black hole engulfs my body. I look up at them again. My mother and sister now appear sad, and they are waving goodbye to me. I get the feeling that they want to help me, but they can't. I am completely terrified... am I going to hell?

Eyes open, I see light. I can barely move. Where am I? What happened? I can't talk. I am dreaming? I think I am dreaming. No wait, something happened. I know him, he's my friend. I can kind of move my arms now. I am starting to speak. I did something, I smoked some Salvia. Ooooo my god.

After 15-20 of utter confusion I put all the peaces back together. Everything was becoming clear again. WOW!!! That was a fucking wacky experience. I sit there for a few minutes just going over what happened in my head, and then started to recall my experience with my friend.

My thoughts were heavy with that experience for the rest of that night. Weeks later, and I still think about it several times a day. Something's not quite right; I don't quite know how to explain it. My experience or vision has left me with a dreadful feeling that I have done something terribly wrong and I need to fix it.  I guess my journey has just begun...</bodytext></report>
