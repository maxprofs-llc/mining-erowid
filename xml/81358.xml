This is for people worrying about cocaine and a DT.  I had to get a background check/drug test for my job.  Failure would've ruined my life so I was anxious.  For cocaine I was 84 hours clean and passed.  I had to get a background check through the company Hireright and the whole process took 8 days.  This is just for reference for those worrying about not receiving results.  I worried my rear off thinking the long wait was bad.
