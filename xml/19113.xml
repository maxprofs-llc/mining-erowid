I've read plenty of other people writing things to warn about opiates. Well this story of what has happened to me will make a person really think twice before popping pills.
/n
/n
I'm 19 years old now, and my health is that of a 65 year old.
/n
I have numerous health problems and have ignored the most major one of them all (Diabetes).
/n
/n
I started smoking pot and drinking when I was 12 years old. It was available, and my Mom never objected since my older sister was doing it. Soon after that, I started smoking crack at the age of 14. (The neighbohood I lived in had a RICH supply of dealers.)
/n
/n
I stopped smoking crack with intervention from Social Services, and eventually (with their help) graduated high school at the age of 17. Now mind you I have never stopped smoking pot...I don't think I can remember a time when I haven't smoked weed. But anyways....
/n
/n
After Graduating, I moved out of the house and started dabbling in every drug you can imagine (except for heroin!). I have a very addicitng personality and am Schitzophrenic, so that just added to matters. After winning the battle of a Methamphetamine and Exstacy addiction, I then started the vicodin addiction. I kicked that one relatively quick, since I had no Health Insurance and the pills are so expensive!
/n
/n
As I had said before, I have a lot of health problems. So in July of 2002 I found out I had a condition where my stomach and intestines had pulled and twisted into themselves...Well that required surgery right away. WHile they were in there, they also found an inflammed appendix, so The Surgeon removed that as well.
/n
/n
While in the hospital, I was being given Darvocet, Vicodin, and IV Morphine for pain control. (You can imagine how quick that Opiate addiction came back...and it came back HARD!)
/n
/n
After being released from the hospital, I got a bottle of 60 Vicodin from the Surgeon. After those were gone, he refused to give me any more. Well by that time, I had gotten on a Health Assistance program that gave me a free doctor, free prescriptions, and FREE ER visits!
/n
/n
I then started going to the ER almost every other night complaining of pain where I had my surgery done. Why? For the Demeral, Morphine, and 10 day script of vicodin, of course!!!!
/n
/n
Well...After about 1 month of that, they got suspicious....But I had already by then gotten in to see that free Doctor. I quickly obtained prescriptions for Klonopin and Darvocet. I ended up selling the Klonopins and traded the Bottle of 60 Darvocet-N-100's for a bottle of Percodan...
/n
Once I got ahold of the Percodan (Oxycodone) about 3 months ago, it has been even MORE downhill from there.
/n
/n
I went from taking over 8 vicodin per day to taking over 10 percodans a day! 
/n
/n
Today, I've decided to take a break from the Oxycodone and go for the Hydrocodone. I took 4 Vicodin 5/500's about 1 an hour ago, so I'm sorry if these typings are just rants.
/n
/n
I wish I could stop....I've tried....and tried....and tried......
/n
But I can't.....I've even tried going to Church!!
/n
/n
So here is my summary:
/n
/n
If was not not addicted to any kind of Opiate, I would STRONGLY TRY (not even for FUN!) popping a pill.
/n
/n
I would tell the Doctors at the hospital I don't want any Narcotic pain relievers!  They make mefeel good for a little while....But the long term effects just destroyed my life!
/n
/n
I'm 19 years old and have a Majpor in Computer Science, but I cannot work or even walk up the steps without losing all my strength because of my health problems and my drug addiction...
/n
/n
I'll bet if I kicked this addicitiction, I would increase my chances of living to see 50 years old...
/n
/n
Don't be like me. . .
