After quite a bit of searching for some Foxy, I managed to get in contact with a chemist from Japan.  He offered to sell me small quantities at an exorbitant price, at which point I refused and told him that I would be forced (by budget constraints) to look elsewhere.  He was determined to gain my business, and so he sent me two vials containing 10mg 5-MeO-DIPT each for free.

By the time the vials reached me yesterday, I had located another source to buy in bulk from, but decided to go ahead and try some of his stuff anyway, for which I plan to pay him, considering his generosity.
/n

My first thought was that this substance could be dangerous to buy and cut in bulk.  The 10mg looked to be a miniscule amount - about the size of the lead tip of a dull pencil.  Be careful if you plan on cutting from a large amount, because the dosage to effect curve seems like it could potentially be pretty steep.

Everything hereafter is text that I wrote during the actual trip.  All added comments are in [brackets].

T (7:18) -  Ingestion of 10mg 5-MeO-DIPT.  Approximately 2 hours previous, ingestion of a full meal.  Consumption of large quantities of water all day.  Taste is not unbearable, but certainly not pleasant.  Unpleasant aftertaste lingering a good while.
/n
/n
T + 13 minutes (7:31) -  First effects noticeable.  Feels like when I first begin to get tipsy, combined with the beginnings of a 200mg caffeine rush.
/n
/n
T + 15 minutes (7:33) -  Flexing of jaw muscles.  Typical tryptamine feeling is starting to set in.
/n
/n
T + 17 minutes (7:35) -  Vision becoming altered - I'm not sure how exactly.  It seems as if there's the slightest vibration in whatever I look at.  The coming up phase is happening very rapidly.  Everything on the television seems to have an added dimension - a 'deeper' visual quality.  Feeling significantly speeded up.
/n
/n
T + 23 minutes (7:41) -  Less than settling disorientation setting in.  Mild nausea.  Feels very synthetic.  You can tell this was manufactured - not a 'natural' drug feel.  Mild nausea now moving to moderate nausea.  The come up is taking some conscious calming of my mind and body.  Slight tremors in my hands.  No...constant shaking [not badly, but noticeably].  Muscles tense involuntarily.  Jaw is about to explode (doesn't feel bad, I can just tell it needs to move).
/n
/n
T + 33 minutes (7:51) -  Feel a bit cracked out.  Muscle tension is uncomfortable.  Backrub [by my girlfriend, who was my sitter] feels very good.
/n
/n
T + 35 minutes (7:53) -  Hands are sweating.  Every movement feels as though I have to adjust to it halfway through.  I'm constantly 'getting my bearings' while moving.  Feels as though my breathing has become shallow - taking deep breaths feels very good.
/n
/n
T + 40 minutes (7:58) -  Leveling out a bit.  Feeling more pleasantly high as my body adjusts.  I want to try taking this in combo with a muscle-relaxer.  [I am not a chemist, nor am I a 'psychonaut'; this was a note to myself.  There might be some sort of contraindication to taking a muscle relaxer with Foxy.  This is something that I will study before engaging in, and I encourage the same thing for anyone else.]  A fan would be great right now!  Cool air feels good.  My body feels good, but complacent.  Don't want to stand up or move around yet - my tummy isn't quite sure about this yet.
/n
/n
T + 47 minutes (8:05) -  Definitely feels like MDMA now, except for the tummy discomfort.  [Note: This statement was in reference to my mental state.  Don't take this expecting a substitute for MDMA.  While sensitivity to tactile sensation is increased, touch is not orgasmic like ecstacy.]
/n
/n
T + 49 minutes (8:07) -  Pupils feel dialated - let me go check.  [My pupils were dialated, but I forgot to record it for some reason.]  Tryptamine feel now.  I could be on morning glory or hawaiian baby woodrose and not be able to tell a difference.
/n
/n
T + 54 minutes (8:12) - Drinking mylanta.  Body immediately goes from warm to cool.
/n
/n
From what I've experienced thus far, I don't think I would like this in a club/rave atmosphere, but maybe physical movement would actually help.  [I tested this hypothesis by getting up and dancing a bit.  It was certainly not unpleasant, like I thought it would be.  Lying down I felt complacent, like I didn't want to move at all, but once I engaged in physical activity, it was no problem.]
/n
/n
I desire the presence of someone else who is in the same mental state I am.  I don't know why exactly, but I think it might put me more at ease.
/n
/n
WISH I HAD GUM! [Gum is definitely something you will want to have handy.  I have never ground my teeth on MDMA like most people do, so I didn't think I would need any.  But Foxy caused some hardcore tension.  I might even go so far as to buy a teething ring next time.]
/n
/n
Moving is more fun that sitting still now, so I don't notice all the muscle tension and twitching.  This experience is LSA plus one caffeine pill to me.  Repetetive motion feels good and makes me psychologically comfortable.
/n
/n
Now I don't want to move again.  Not a bit.  [I went back and forth like this for most of the first 2 hours.]
/n
/n
Porn looks pretty, but causes no actual arousal - no desire for sex or physical reaction to stimuli (no hard on).
/n
/n
T + 1 hour 51 minutes (9:09) -  Feels like an LSA trip, but I'm more prone to be active again.  My girlfriend and I just had sex, and I was much more...interested in different aspects of it.  Her body looked very beautiful.  [Orgasm was not enhanced at all, but I was in a totally different state of mind than when I usually engage in intercourse.  Hard to explain, but definitely pleasant.  I also seemed to be able to go a bit longer than usual.]
/n
/n
Chewing on this pen feels so good.
/n
/n
T + 2 hours 32 minutes (9:50) -  Since 9:00 the trip has been really cool.  Emotional openness was especially noted in a conversation I just had with my girfriend.  I'm eating now, so we'll see how that goes.  [At the time I wrote this, I had left the house and gone to Subway.  I felt perfectly comfortable in a public setting and acted completely normal.]
/n
/n
T + 3 hours 12 minutes (10:30) -  Coming down a bit?  I only suggest this because I'm experiencing a stiffness in my neck as if the drug wasn't allowing the muscles there to flex (it felt earlier as if they were flexing constantly).  This could just be...  [At this point I lost interest in writing this thought down and set my notepad down.]
/n
/n
T + 4 hours 42 minutes (12:00) -  Pupils still very much dialated.  Smoked two bowls of high-quality grass.  Suddenly things are a bit more trippy (who'd have thought?).  :)  I don't feel the type of sinus congestion that I usually do after smoking pot.  [The congestion came on later than usual.]
/n
/n
Wow.  This is nuts.  This is what meth-laced pot would feel like.  Open-eye visuals.  I hear running water....is that in my head?  It's SO clear and vivid.  [This turned out to be my paused DVD player spinning a disk - it sounded very different than it normally would.]  Can't focus my eyes very well without straining.  CEVs are amazing.  This is a trip in the literal sense.  Now it feels like meth-acid.  [After this point I closed my eyes and was engulfed by electric patterns, muscle flexing, intense concept changes - very much like a substantial dose of LSD.]
/n
/n
T + 6 hours 27 minutes (2:45) -  Pupils still dialated.  Definitely coming down now.  I want to sleep.  Shoulder and neck muscles are sore.
