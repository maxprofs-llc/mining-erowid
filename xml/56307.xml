So I've done mushrooms before, but in a different way, I smoked them with a few of my friends not knowing till after I did that, that it was a real bad idea. I didn't really have that bad of an affect, especially since I smoked weed along with the mush and ended up burning out real fast. Last night I decided with my friend that we would eat all the much we bought. We bought 8 grams and went to my room to begin eating them.

We put on a movie and waited for the trip to begin, we ate them at about 9:15, and the magic started to begin around 10:00. I was staring at my light and it started beaming off rainbow lines, I looked over to my friend and started laughing so hard, and I couldnt stop. Everything around me was so funny, even my friends face, her pupils were enlarged to the max, and I wanted to take a picture of it so bad, but couldn't focus on anything but laughing.

We decided to go on the computer to talk to people and tell them what we were doing. I signed on to msn, and went on webcam for one of my friends and the computer screen expanded sideways and all I could see was my face melting, and my body turn to liquid. I felt like my body was evaporating and that there was nothing I could do, or anyone else either. I turned off the computer and started to call people so I could get out of my house and experience the outdoors. No one would stay on the phone with me for longer than 5 minutes, everyone was hanging up, I felt as if the world hated me, and that the house was capturing me and telling me to stay inside and not socialize. I became depressed and scared and didn't know what to do.

We ended up deciding to go out for a walk for some air (not a good idea). There were so many people out walking, and I somehow felt bigger and stronger than everyone else. The houses looked like doll houses and I felt giant, and that I didn't fit in. I saw a man walking by me and he had the face of a zombie, a scary zombie with a black hollow face. I was so scared, I couldn't continue the walk, I had to turn around and get home.

We stayed in my room most of the night, where the trip became horrifying, I was laying on my bed paralyzed, I couldn't move, and no one could help me. I was melting into the sheets, and I couldn't breathe. I just wanted it all to end, I kept closing me eyes, but every time I did voices would talk to me and I'd see scary pictures, such as people puking everywhere, and people slitting each other throats. I couldn't take it anymore, and there was nothing I could do to make it stop. My friend told me water will help calm me down, and so the next thing I know I'm standing in my shower. I had no idea why or what I was supposed to be doing, so I started shampooing and conditioning my hair. I kept talking to the shower cap as if it were my friend.

The hot temperature of the water was so friendly to me, I didn't want to leave the bathroom, but I realized my friend was all alone and I didn't want to be alone anymore. I got out and didn't even bother drying myself off with a towel, I felt so free! I walked into my room and threw on clothes even though I was drenched, and I layed down beside my friend, and molded to my bed. I couldn't even think straight, everything I said made no sense but she understood me so well. She was the only thing I had, I felt as though my life was in her hands.

The room started changing shape around me and I felt as if everything was shrinking and I was getting bigger and bigger. I kept trying to make everything end by sleeping, my body was exhausted but my mind was so alive, and I wanted to keep talking. I couldn't stop moving my legs, every time I'd stop moving I thought I was going to collapse and be taken away into a black hole that was in the corner of my room, it was calling me into it, and I was paranoid that I'd never be the same way I was ever again.

I had to pee so bad, but my room was the only place I could be, I was paralyzed, and the washroom was the enemy and I felt as if it would keep me in there and never let me out if I went into it. My friend made me get up to go pee, and I came back into the room and felt so much better, my trip was a completely different situation now. Everything in my room had a meaning, and was special to me in every way. I just wanted to smile and enjoy my life. My room was the place I was meant to be, I felt so safe, and nothing outside of my room never existed, it was all a memory. I looked at the clock and realized the clock wasn't moving, the hands weren't moving at all, I had accomplished so many things in all of 3 minutes, I was living for the moment. Everything I had done before I was happy never happened.

I was starting to come back to normal, things were starting to wear off, and as it did I felt so much better about myself, my life had meaning and I felt as if I should share with people and make them happy to. I still couldn't fall asleep, my mind was still wired and wanted to keep looking at everything in the room changing shapes and sizes.

I finally ended up coming off the trip, which I was so happy about. My body was tired, and so was I now. I leaned over to my friend and the both of us both just couldn't believe what had happened to us.</bodytext></report>
