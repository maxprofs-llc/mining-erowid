I take Adderall for ADD/mild autism, and unfortunately for me, my brain needs a much higher dose than my kid-sized stature can handle.

As soon as I start 'coming down' from the Adderall, I take a bunch of Vitamin C tablets, probably 4-10 (1000mg).  I usually was looking at about 2 to 6 hours each day (yuck) of dealing with the wearing off effects, but I haven't had to deal with it at all since I figured out this nifty little trick.</bodytext></report>
