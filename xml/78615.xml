I was pretty much out of any drugs so I turned to what's around me, this has led me so far, to inhalants, DXM, and nitrous. And that day I came across a bunch of whipped creams in the fridge. Now, my first experience before this was disassociation from my body, numbness in my lips, and overwhelming euphoria. The day I did three cans went WAY far beyond this.

After I had inhaled the cans I was overtaken by not feeling, physically. The euphoria had surpassed euphoria, the chemicals in my brain had to be scrambling through the neurons beyond nature's intent. The house plants gave way to jungle, the darkness to space. I ran through this chaos, climbing this thing, like an animal. At the time I experienced a feeling indescribable, like I wasn't me, like my body was being a host to this insane alien world. I sat and stared into oblivion, there were two, dancing, shimmering. As I came back, rather abruptly and unwillingly, the two gave way to small lights on the DVD player, and I was laying in my bed.</bodytext></report>
