Having never experienced this specific Salvia before. I smoked twice after the first bowl had little effect. Soon perception altered in a most unfamiliar way. One moment on the couch in my workshop and the next in etherical space with many other being, uncountable thousands.Asort of circus or surfing a sea of energy.

Soon I become aware differently, with will, power. I stood in both realms knowing the room I was in and aware of the world that appeared  to be above me and to the right. I chose to fully enter and experienced on a level of awareness that permiated my entire being. I was in part and the whole at once. After what felt to be 3 min. there was a fade I could see the room materializing beneath me and slightly to the left. Back in the room. little effect remained.</bodytext></report>
