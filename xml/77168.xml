After trying many herbal things I decided to give another a go. The capsules contain Guarana, Mucuna and Coffee extract. Stimulants generally don't have much effect on me so I did not feel particulary energised. I have tried guarana in high doses on it's own and felt nothing.

After having two caps (recomended daily dose is 3) I had a pleasant floaty feeling almost comparable to that of a mild cannibis high. Considering the capsules were rather inexpensive, I'm quite happy. I will definitly be trying to obtain Mucuna on it's own without the guarana as I don't like taking high doses of caffeine since it does nothing for me.</bodytext></report>
