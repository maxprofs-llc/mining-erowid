About 3 weeks earlier my brother and my friend TJ had a catapulting experience after ingesting the substance 2CE.  Because I purchased it and didnt taste any, I was pretty pissed about it, but when they visited me at home at the 5th hour of their trip, I was actually excited.  The way they explained their psychedelic frames of minds completely fascinated me, and they just told me 'Wait til you try it, its almost unexplainable.' So I got ahold of some 2C-E and weighed it out between two of my friends:  3 Neuronauts searching for nothing, everything, something.  Whatever we could reach beyond the confines of our own rational, thinking brains.  A Psychedelic Journey.

What TJ and my bro ate before was about 12 mg a piece. This time TJ wanted a full-on retinal performance and space/time destruction, and my other friend Atom was looking for the same.  But owning a larger body, Atom is always the first to come down and his trips are less involved, and knowing the recommended dose for a 'common' trip is about 12 mg, he ingested about 16.  TJ did the same.  I decided to try it out with the same amount TJ had the first time, because our trips seem to be similar, so I ate 12 mg.  Keep in mind that we have experimented with several potentially dangerous substances such as DXM, Dramamine, Psilocybin, MDMA, and LSD and are sure of our susceptibility to altered states of consciousness and are all familiar with research done by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, in particular The Psychedelic Experience base on the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which can be very useful at times.

So after the zero hour, we drive to our 'trip room' that serves as a place of comfort for complete EGO-Loss.  A basement bedroom where there is little chance of external distractions unless we choose there to be.  (for myself, this trip was completely engulfing, so the time frames are probably a little skewed, but I will do my best) It was about 30-45 minutes when my vision was being manipulated by the drug.  It was difficult to focus on objects (internally and externally) and directing my attention on something would have maybe made me ill.  But as we are always prepared, we put in a TRIP-MIX that suited us all, and I decided to close my eyes and groove to the pleasant sounds of Radiohead, Syd Barret, Yes, and others!  My sense of musical vibrations was enhanced tremendously.

I had no inclination to open my eyes and go about my normal behavior, because I could feel myself dissolving into my body.  A really nice feeling.  But when I tried to maintain my 'normal' game-playing self, the ecstasy diminished.  So I let the music guide me.  This experience showed me that floating into a trip with the help of music makes it much more enjoyable and lets the mind merge into the psych/physiological changes.

The rest of trip is like a colorful blur, where my body felt as if it WAS an itch, and the moment right before a climax, and a sneeze, and every incredible moment that a body that go through.  It was as if my linear mind was opened up to experience the infinite workings of itself.  I could feel everything, and it was sometimes disturbing; at one moment I could feel complete bliss and then feel as if I was going to die.  But being able to control my mind states, I was able to drift out of this harmful thought and involve myself in any other thing.  It also felt as if my entire body was vibrating at a tremendous speed, and it could have been because my body WAS shaking, or the shaking was a result of the realization.

Memories, feelings, thoughts and much more whirled through me and past me in miniscule amounts of time.  Quite exhilarating.  When I smoked a cigarette outside in the car (keep in mind we didn't drive, I don't think we could've accomplished that) I could feel the steps that my brain went through every time I smoked, except I experienced them in the weirdest ways.  I could feel myself flicking the cigarette when I had it at my mouth, and vice versa.  A really incredible trip.

The next time I do this, it will be by myself where I can do some real soul searching.  This is far from a recreational drug, as we had enough trouble walking down the street to a Walgreens.  ('can I get a pack of Parlmoros?' )  There is much more to learn about ourselves, and 2CE, for the right persons, can be very useful.

( i would like some feedback from anyone interested in the ability of the mind, or anyone who has experienced they think might be the Infinite Know...we know...we know...we know...)</bodytext></report>
