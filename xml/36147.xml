I had a good experience with Vassopressin a while back with cognitive performance increasing affects.

I had been taking Adderall for about 10 days staight with constant study sessions and working a full time job. If I felt I could not retain the material I would then try Ritalin or Dexadrine, but it got to the point that I just could not concentrate no matter what stimulant, so when I took 1 spray of Vassopressin up each nostril, it instantly made me be able to focus again, It only took one time and I would not go back to using it until about 3 months later when I felt run down again by the stimulants.

I later took vasopressin during a time when I was much more rested and not taking stimulants as much and I had a harder time being able to see results from this drug.</bodytext></report>
