Trial 1: 140 mg orally 
/n
Took in capsule. Hit me after 1.25 hours.  A lot of speed with mild to medium euphoria.  Peaked about 1.25 after it first hit.  Fast and not-too-pleasant comedown.

Trial 2: Keybones after an oral dose
/n
After the 140 mg oral dose came down completely, the FOAF felt tired. So the FOAF had several key bones every once in a while.  While sober, snorting BZP hurts a lot.  But after taking the chemical orally, the pain was reduced tremendously.
