I was prescribed the sleeping aid Zopiclone a few weeks ago. I'd been mentioning problems sleeping to my doctor for a few months and while mostly truthful, I must admit I had the intent to try whatever was given to me recreationally.

When I got home in the evening with my bottle of 30 little blue pills, I took 3 with water on an empty stomach and wasted some time on my computer waiting for it to kick in. I went to the bathroom after about half an hour, and while in there I started my first hallucinations. Bright pinpoints of light began dancing around the hairs on my arms. I'd never previously had a hallucinogenic experience and was quite elated, but also I felt a distinct and extreme euphoria. I felt like I was on top of the world.

When I went back to my computer and sat down I noticed a semi-transparent person sitting across my apartment on my bed, waving at me. I knew this was obviously a hallucination and had some fun with it (undetermined gender). I waved back, then it soundlessly moved its lips. I walked over to the figure but when I was close enough my eyes realized it had only been a pile of bedsheets in the dark. At a distance however the hallucination had been completely convincing, aside from being see-through, as if the sheets simply weren't there.

I closed my bedroom door, leaving myself in complete darkness, and slipped into bed. I began to see distinct architecture appear, as if I was in a completely different room and could see the walls and ceiling clearly despite the darkness. I closed my eyes with no change to the images, and began moving around and exploring this structure from within my mind. This is my last memory of my experience.

When I slipped into bed, it was Wednesday night and I had only taken 3 pills without any intention to take more. I'd made the decision to ration them, even after having fun with the initial hallucinations.

I woke up Friday morning around 3:00am dazed and confused. I started text messaging my mother, for some reason thinking it was the evening, and she called me wondering why the hell I was messaging her so late. I apologized and said I hadn't realized it was so late, (she must have been suspicious), then ended the conversation. I made my way to my computer where I noticed the bottle of Zopiclone was empty.

I couldn't believe I'd taken them all so I searched high and low throughout my apartment for them, expecting to find them any time. I never found them despite searching everywhere, and considering I slept through an entire day I can only assume that I got up sometime during my trip and took the rest. Whether all at once or a few at a time, I don't know. This was incredibly stupid of me - I wish I could remember why and how I took them, but from initially falling asleep and waking up over a day later, I have absolutely no memory.

I'm lucky I didn't hurt myself, whether through the high dose or simple stumbling about, and thankful I didn't go wander somewhere. Wandering on a trip downtown in a big city, during the middle of the night, on a street with dark alleys, gangs, and homeless people, really wouldn't have ended well.

When I woke up, aside from the initial confusion and a rather unpleasant taste which ruined everything I ate or drank for the next day or so, I had no ill effects. In about a month I plan on going back to my doctor for a refill (she said I shouldn't use them every day, only 'as needed', so going back within 30 days would be suspicious), and I really hope I can be more responsible with them when I try again.</bodytext></report>
