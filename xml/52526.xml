I have had a relationship with Sally D for quite some time now.  I have experimented with this amazing herb in various fashions... plain leaf, extract, sublingual, and tincture.  Salvia tends to be less confusing and intense  when used sublingual or as a tincture.

This account is one with a 10x extract.  I woke up at about 2:00 AM.  I had an urge to smoke her.  I woke up and felt completely relaxed and knew that it was a good time to partake of her essence.

I loaded a small pinch into my glass pipe and inhaled usual Sally fashion (while holding the smoke in for about 30 seconds).  In my mind I spoke to her asking her to teach me.  I laid back down and relaxed.  Swift was her descent upon me.

When smoking the extract there is always the usual feeling of my senses being peeled away.  It is hard to let go.  Letting go is very difficult.  Clinging to what we know seems to be a natural instinct of life.

After the first initial effects took hold I tried to relax and see what Sally had to show me.  I have been doing dream work and she decided to teach me a little on this topic.  She showed me what it is to dissolve the ego and let go.  This is an essential step in dream work.  PURE awareness is required.

Its hard to explain what I had been shown.  It was kind of like our reality is composed of an idea that we feed and keep alive.  We create who we are and are always feeding this idea with our thoughts.  Sally tears this into shreds and show us ourselves in our nakedness.   This can be a very scary thing.  It is like being forced outside of everything that I and others have created as the understanding of reality, whether you are ready or not.

There is a technique for going directly into a dream from being awake.  This is by distracting our mind by counting and going past the hypnogacic Images.  I was shown that this is not required if one can achieve a certain state of awareness by learning to let go without drifting off to sleep.  A usual characteristic of Sally is a lucid dream like state of consciousness.  She showed me that this is why.

I never hallucinated parse.  It was just the feeling of having all my ideas of the way life is torn from me and then being taught through telepathy of some sort.  I could feel the understanding just flowing through me.  I didnt actually hear her speak.

This whole experience and understanding took about 10 minutes.

I decided to gain a deeper understanding of what had perspired by taking a pinch of the 10x extract and placing it under my tongue.  I let that absorb for the full 30 minutes and then swallowed.  I know I have read that one cant use the extract sublingual.  I felt her presence very subtly.  It kept her close to me to help guide my dreams.

I used my new knowledge to step straight into a lucid dream...  I could feel her presence throughout the dream.   It was very enlightening; only this portion of the experience is for me alone.

She is a teacher and a wonderful ally.  I have been reprimanded once for improper use.  Needless to say, I will never make that mistake again.</bodytext></report>
