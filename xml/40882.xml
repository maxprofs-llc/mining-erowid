I don't ahve much experience with drugs, some cannabis and that's about it. So for first timers Zoloft is really not recomended. It may look as if it is a light drug, but is really strong. For me it was too much, I was pale as a ghost, my pupils fully dilated I wanted to puke all night long and couldnt sleep until 7 in the morning, I took the pills about 1 am, took 2 first, then I thought they were not doing anything so I took the third one and that is when they really kicked in. It was a really bad experience, my jaws were tense and hurt for about 2 days.  I really dont recommend this. Very bad trip.</bodytext></report>
