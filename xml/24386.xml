My story starts out pretty simple.  I was in my shed one day, and found a tank of freon (R-22). I had always looked down on huffing, but I was depressed, so I took a 'whippit' balloon and filled it up, inhaled, my voice got deeper, and this is where I started doing it frequently, making prank calls with 'the voice', etc. Finally, after about a week of inhaling on this 30lb tank, I got the weirdest feeling in my mouth. Like chalk dusk. There was even a little demon/gremilin that would appear at times. This was only the beginning.

Being in a 'fuck it' mood', I went to the shed and took a can of gas, opened the 'carb' hole (put there for east pouring) and sucked the fumes straight from the nozzle. At first I was just amazed my how the wood grains would form shapes and images, later I actually found myself talking to what I call 'gas buddies' (the hallucinations)
/n
One day I was huffing and I thought my friend died because the hallucination of him came to me.

I found myself huffing not only for the visuals, but for the company of these imaginary 'friends' that would come to me when I would start to huff. I have been struggling with this addiction for about 7 months now, at one point in time, I noticed some neurological damage, for one side of my finger was numb for about a month. I still fight the constant urge to inhale the evil fumes. All the hours I spent, with my eyes closed, inhaling and visualising VERY prominent shapes, people, places, sometimes seeming so real that it felt as if I had been warped to another dimension.

I always just thought kids huffed to get a buzz, I never got that, I thought I was the only one who hallucinated off of it. For a while I thought it was brain damage, which I know now, that I do have some brain damage. (If I look at an object for a couple seconds and close my eyes, it's outline will appear in various colors).

At one point in time, I was contacted by a guy's voice, his name was 'Lord Zonar'. He said, 'I will grant you three wishes to [used a very long, made up word] your parents.'
/n
He kept saying this, it echoed in my head, I asked what the word meant... the reply, 'TO KILL' 'TO KILL' 'TO KILL', it kept echoing in my head over and over and I didn't touch the shit for about a day or two, but soon found myself in it's clutches again. I now have boarded up any possible openings to the shed, and put a padlock on it, giving the key to my mom.

If I were to include every sngle detail, bad or 'good', this would end up being a novel. All I can say is thanks to the people who submitted their reports on this similiar situation, for now I know I'm not the only one. I have experienced alot, from a to z, including crack cocaine, and IV drugs, but the psychological addicion of this fuel had been the hardest to quit. No joke.
/n
If I could do it again, I wouldnt make the same mistake by even 'experimenting once', because as soon as I got those closed-eye visuals, I was hooked.

Take heed to my words. PLEASE.  I am less 'scarred' by my past IV use, than I am by this horrid, horrid addiction of huffing.
