I opened the bottle and took a whiff. Hot damn! It smelled just like ammonium hydroxide! A quick peek at the inactives revealed that it contained ammonium carbonate[1]! No doubt as to discourage persons such as myself from taking it for non-cough related purposes.

Nailing my courage to the sticking place, I held my nose and took in half of the 8 oz. bottle, only to violently projectile vomit all of it out straight away, due to the overwhelming stench of ammonium and the sickly sweet flavor of the other inactives. No need to say that I didn't experience anything DXM related.
