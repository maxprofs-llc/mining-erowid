This was my third time taking bromo-dragonfly. I first took 6 drops of bromo-dragonfly and after about an hour and a half I was feeling very happy and excited. After about 2 hours I was a bit confused and everything around me started to change colour and I realised that I had no depth perception and everything had a green and purple blurry outline around the edges. After about 4 hours me and my friend decided to take 3 more drops each that were on a sugar cube.

After about 4 and a half hours I started seeing patterns all over the walls and floor and everyone's faces looked completely deformed. This continued for about 6 more hours and every 2 or so hours I took 3 more drops until all 12 were gone. The whole experience lasted for about 2 days even tho I hadn't taken any more after the 12 drops were gone and I consumed them with the first 8 hours. I couldn't sleep for days and couldn't relax or get comfortable. I occasionally get flashbacks from the trip when I smoke cannabis. But the whole experience was pretty cool.</bodytext></report>
