        Wow, first acid trip in 8 months. This dude I know from on the
/n
Internet sent me two hits of Red Sun acid, and I took them both. It hit me
/n
fast, in about a half hour, and it hit me hard. I played guitar and talked
/n
on the Internet for about 2 hours.
/n
/n
        It was an interesting trip. It hit me a little around midnight of
/n
the 20th. I took a hit of pot right at midnight to celebrate the first
/n
minute of the first day of spring, and that kicked in the acid. Around
/n
1:45 things were real intense so I decided to get off the computer and go
/n
lay down in bed. The near-full moon was very bright and shining in my
/n
window, with clouds swirling unnaturally fast around it. The bars of my
/n
window frame were flickering around, and the still bare tree branches
/n
outside were dancing wit their own life. It was very visual, and too
/n
intense to look at for long, so I pulled down the shade and closed my
/n
eyes, and went to that inner, chaotic, cut and paste universe of vivid
/n
imagery that I hadn't been to in years. Cartoony voices seemed to be
/n
saying nonsense words from every direction as I floated there in
/n
hyperspace, saying things like 'Zlerty-zot meep awwww znew' or 'Sbpack
/n
Sbpack.' After a while, the chaos organized somewhat, becoming a jumbled
/n
collection of imagery and themes that seemed to come from Jewish culture.
/n
Flash to images of a baby in a crip, this feels something like a memory.
/n
This gives way to images of people I know now, only I see them as they
/n
would have been as small children. Eventually things spiral down to more
/n
coherent imagery, and I lay in bed thinking about life until around 4:30
/n
when I managed to fall asleep.
/n
/n
        I haven't tripped like that in years.</bodytext></report>
