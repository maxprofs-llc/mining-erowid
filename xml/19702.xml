I got 30g of wormwood a few weeks ago and have tried it mixed with weed in a two chamber bong and mixed with salvia in my gravity bong.  It tasted like shit, and only enhanced the feeling mildly.  I would not have tried smoking it straight because of the taste, but from the mild effect when mixed with weed I assumed that, alone, it would not be anything incredible.

I was looking up some information about thujone when I saw that its boiling point is only 1 degree celcius above that of THC according to the sources that google turned up.  I just smoked a bowl of it in my vaporizer (a home made contraption, soldering iron vaporizer/bubbler).  It actually didn't taste bad... almost a bit like mint.  It was also extremely smooth.

The feeling is not unlike that of marijuana, minus the munchies, giggling, and memory loss.  I am also more sedated than I usually am when I am high.

The verdict: not bad at all considering the price (I got 30 grams online for $11 shipped) and legality.  Wormwood is without a doubt my favorite legal drug that I have tried to date.</bodytext></report>
