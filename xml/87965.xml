Ok I got prescribed this stuff because I supposedly have depression with phsychotic features. I experimented with insuffalating it before here and there. but when I got this script I decided to snort some, I turned on some music on the 'puter and crushed away. my mood was completely neutral at this time.

Right as I snort the first line I get a lovely burn...I loved the burn , then the numbness. I felt like i could conqer the world. And mind you , this stuff DOES have reinforcing effects, cuzz 15 later I wanted another two rails. then I played video games for like 30 minutes and wanted another two rails.

I felt totally euphoric, but I noticed my heart started beating a little hard and remembered the thing about the siezure threshold so I took 3mg of klonopin sublingually to fight any convulsivness. then I did another 2 rails. a rush of euphoria gave me goos bumps vision is a lil weird. its not numbing any more at this point.

i feel like i have to do something. i clean my room spotless. i do another two  rails. then i wash my nostrils out with water for better insuffalation...i'm tweaking. i feel like i need it. i've been playing video games and snorting line after line like a tweaker for 2 days..</bodytext></report>
