I had begun my night like usual, drinking beers at my friends house. I was getting a good buzz when I heard that someone we knew was selling pills of morphine for 2$ a pop. I had never tried it before so I decided to take one with my friend. I had already drank about 4 beers at this time, so I was a little worried about mixing the two. The guy said it would be fine, so we took the pill. Very soon after I felt it. It was very relaxing, but not very strong at all. We continued drinking beers until I had had about 8 beers. By this point we could barely feel the pill so I decided to try one more. After the second pill was down, I was really feeling good. I had a great body fry and felt really relaxed. The night had gone very smoothly, so I decided I would watch some tv. Soon I was pretty tired so I went to my bed.

For some reason I wasnt able to fall asleep. At about 3:00 in the morning something weird started happening. I started getting a very strong head rush, and it was scaring me because I didnt know why it was happening so late after I took the pills. I started to feel very dizzy as well. Once I made it to the bathroom I looked in the mirror. My pupils were very very small and my face was very white. I then started sweating uncontrollably. By this point I was starting to panic and wondering if I should call 911. I figured I would just wait it out though. The last thing I experianced was nausea. I came close to vomiting but never actually did. After only about 20 minutes this bad experiance was over, and I headed back to bed and went to sleep. This night was fun up until that point, and that was enough to make me never want to take morphine again</bodytext></report>
