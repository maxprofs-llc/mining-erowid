This is my recipe for nutmeg balls it makes its a hell of a lot easier to swallow and I get a little high while cooking it.
/n
/n
1) I grind up whole nutmeg nuts. 
/n
2) I bring a small pan of water to a slight boil.
/n
3) I pour the ground nutmeg in. I make sure there are no sharp chunks in it.
/n
4) I boil the water off on medium heat until it turns into a gooey paste stirring occasionally. 
/n
5)I quickly scoop it onto some cellophane wrap and roll it up.
/n
6)I let the paste sit for about a day. 
/n
7) I roll in to swallowable balls. Trip starts when my body begins to digests the nutmeg.</bodytext></report>
