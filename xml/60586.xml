Salvia Divinorum x20

the fit of giggles so involuntarily escaped us
/n
that the stillness of night was sharply,
/n
uproariously broken
/n
throughout the park &amp; nearby homes.
/n
hushed by surprise of our
/n
own effect, the others moved towards the car -
/n
one hopping, another in mad sprint,
/n
Goo extended a hand to
/n
help me up the stone bench. however,
/n
he was much amused to find,
/n
his motion &amp; whispered entreaties were met
/n
with utter befuddlement.
/n
in the mental place void of
/n
familiar rationality, i wondered agape :
/n
    but, why?
/n
    why leave?
/n
as i caressed the flat stone in
/n
circular strokes, feeling the grain,
/n
i pondered his motives.
/n

/n
to the extent that the conception
/n
of unity was Artifice.
/n
to separate us thus was to render
/n
&amp; rip us apart.</bodytext></report>
