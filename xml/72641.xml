Lately, I've been making a rather bad habit of staying up until 3 or 4 in the morning. I couldn't wake up early enough that I could make it through the day without passing out late afternoon. Waking up again around 11, and then staying up until early morning could not go on.

Went to the drug store, got the melatonin, tried it. Worked like a charm. Within a few days, I'd be in bed by about 12-1am and be up at about 8 or 9.

However, once sleeping pattern is re-organized, I should have discontinued use. I feel like a can't concentrate at all during the daytime. Dark circles under my eyes, just completely out of it.</bodytext></report>
