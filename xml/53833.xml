After recently attempting to turn my crappy life around, it was suggested that I would be put on medications.

At first, I was excited about the idea. Then, skeptical. I gave it a shot anyway. First off, I was put on Citalopram at a low dose (20mg). Months of the exact same feelings I had previously been having went on. I was put on Fluoxetine, again - 20mg. My mood was somewhat dysphoric after 48 hours of trying this, but I continued taking this for a further 5 months.

After an attempted suicide, and being under watch for 2 weeks, I was prescribed Venlafaxine - The Miricle Drug. Indeed, I found Venlafaxine made my depressing feelings and thoughts fade, at a cost. I am addicted. If I miss one day of my pills, I noticeably start to shiver and spasm. After two days they get worse - shocks are not only muscular but also something I can only describe as 'Brain Twitching'.

Drug Interactions:

Drinking Alcohol on Venlafaxine - I'm sure this is an individual effect on myself, but after drinking alcohol, I tend to wander or roam places, with full consciousness of what I'm doing but without any rationality.

Marajuana on Venlafaxine - Increased Euphoria, Feeling of being outside myself etc. No different than usual.

Anyway, I'm still on the meds, and I know when I eventually need to make my way off them, it will be a hard task.</bodytext></report>
