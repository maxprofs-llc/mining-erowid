After taking 30mg every weekend for 5 weeks, I dose around 40mg in the evening. After the trip I noticed some halucinations occuring in my vision. Every now and then a spot would pop up in my right eyes field of vision. Now I did put my finger on my eye before I fell asleep and was having halucinations.

But every now and then this Spot will pop up and I'll be like trying to make it go away.</bodytext></report>
