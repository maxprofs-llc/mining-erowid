I've been a habitual heroin user for about 3 or 4 months now, and have ingested copius amounts of hydrocodone, codiene, oxycodone/tylenol, and a few morphines, demerols, darvocets in the year before my heroin use started. Every once in awhile, some oxycontins roll into town, and if theyre priced decently or the heroins dry, I'll dabble in a few. The first one I ever did, I ate whole, just swallowed with water, 40mgs time release. And I felt gggrreaaattt. Probably the best opiate high I've ever had, except for my first shot of heroin but thats a different kind of high somehow.

The next one I chewed. The next ones I snorted, this was during the time I began doing heroin and ahd a steadily increasing tolerance. I always snorted my OCs and my heroin, and it got me where I needed to be. However, one day a friend of mine told me he had some spare one piece rigs(needle/syrgine sets). I copped a few, and went to my dope dealers house. He shot me up and good lord, I don't think I've snorted heroin since.

Anyway, I recently 'acquired' about 20 oxycontins(10mgs per pill, the white ones), and my love for the shooting ritual convinced me to peel the coating off of one, crush with the blunt end of a key, then further crush it to a fine powder between two spoons. Once this was done, I scraped all the powder into the larger, deeper spoon. I then added almost 1cc of decently hot water to the spoon. Using a toothpick, I stirred the powder around to begin dissolving it. However, I guess oxycodone hydrochloride is less soluble than the dope I usually shoot because after I cooked it by holding a lighter under the spoon for about 25 seconds, a considerable amount of the powder still remained solid in the water. I would have heated it further but high temperatures can lower or ruin the potentcy of opiates, so I didn't risk it.

Next, I added a small cotton ball for a filter, stuck the tip in the cotton, and sucked the solution into my rig. I quickly re-capped it and placed it in my cup of hot water so the contents wouldnt congeal, and removed the cotton from the spoon, then tyed off my arm with a black leather belt, held it tightly with my teeth, uncapped my rig, chose a nice, average size vien on my left arm, inserted the needle, bevel facing skyward, registered blood without even having to pull back on the plunger. Once the blood was flowing into the rig, PPPLLLUNNNGGGEEE.

The belt was quickly loosened, isopropyl alcohol applied to the point of injection, followed by warm water to aid circulation, and soap for good measure. Although my tolerance for opiates is a bit high these days, it should have done more than it did. I barely registered any feeling at all. I figured this was because some powder still remained in the spoon, so I repeated the steps above twice till the powder was gone. Still barely nothing at all. I peeled, crushed, and snorted one then went to work.

3 hours later, I got off work and tried again with similar results, and I missed one shot, so now I have to worry about an abcess and 'rotting tissue and dead flesh' as one internet informant put it. One last try yielded the same damndable effect, and I gave up and snorted alittle, but not too much cause my breathing is quite slowed. Oh well, one more shot for the fun of shooting and I'm going to bed. Overall, I've decided to go back to snorting. Once I cop some more dope, I'll happily shoot myself silly, but for now, I don't see the point in sticking somthing in my bloodstream that's just gonna dissapoint me.</bodytext></report>
