Not tripping yet, but discussing other things...

The story I am about to tell was of my third experiment with 4-aco-MiPT. The first two tastes I had of this chemical were on the same day, a couple of weeks earlier.
/n

My first dose was 12mg. I took the powder in a shot of Gatorade with my friend, neighbor, and occasional fellow tripper. We both noticed the very rapid onset and we were in a great mood, tripping lightly but satisfactorily, with a feeling somewhat like mushrooms but more energetic and with much less softening of the ego. We were able to be social througout the trip. Later I redosed with 14mg, about six hours after my initial dose, and had a stronger trip than I had earlier in the day. One of the best parts of this trip was jamming on guitar with my friend, neighbor, and occasional fellow tripper. It was certainly one of the best jams we've ever had. It was spontaneous, original, not dominated stylistically by one or the other, and was both some solid playing by the both of us. Playing guitar on 4-aco-MiPT was just as fun and creatively enhanced as it would be on mushrooms or LSD. This slightly higher dose reminded me even more of a cross between mushrooms and LSD, but I admit my list of researched chemicals is pretty light on the tryptamine side so I don't have everything to compare it to.

But that isn't what this trip report is about. So enough chit-chat, let's get down to business.

A tale of the third and most interesting 4-aco-MiPT inspired adventure...
/n
/n
A few weeks later I had convinced my girlfriend, who wanted to take some acid some time soon, to take some 4-aco-MiPT with me instead. I didn't feel like taking acid at the time, perhaps because I'd been slacking off and sulking as of late and didn't feel that I deserved a full blown brain-vacation, but I did want another taste of the 4-aco-MiPT at a higher dose. So I might have hyped it up a bit. But really, because my first two tastes were so delicious and because she wanted to trip anyway, I felt it was justified. And I'm either very picky or completely spontaneous about when I take LSD. This would have been somewhere in between. Anyway she agreed, so /tangent.

It was around 9:00pm when we each dropped a gel-cap containing about 16mg 4-aco-MiPT. Another friend was over, and we talked with him for the next half hour as we felt our first alerts. The first thing I noticed was a bit of a buzz coming on which just felt very 'tryptamine'. For some reason that word seemed to fit the buzz best. It was like energy flowing through my body accompanied by a warm, pleasant soul vibration. Forty-five minutes after dropping the gel-cap this feeling had barely intensified, and it seemed my onset was much delayed compared to the prior trips. I was still at a high +1 when our guest left and we went upstairs. An hour after dropping, she was feeling it allright but not intensely, and didn't seem to enjoy it as much as I did.
/n
/n
So after another fifteen minutes I decided my trip was fully developed and it was time to redose. I took another 4-6mg and then licked a few small chunks of the powder off my finger, probably totalling 6-8 more mg all together. So now I was up to 22-24mg, and I had no doubt the redose would work just fine. My girl stuck with her 16mg dose and seemed to be feeling it a bit more.
/n
/n
The second dose, which was just licked up powder, seemed to be kicking in quick, so we grabbed some whippits and lay down on the bed next to each other. What is there to say about whippits? A whippit on one psychedelic is a whippit on another psychedelic. And that is pretty fuckin' sweet. But a double-whippit on pot is just as good. Anyway, when we came out of our whippit-induced trance we both agreed to immediately do another one. After that I saw I had only three left and didn't really feel another one was nescessary at the moment. Besides, the whippits seemed to have kicked her trip on. After the whippits she immediately seemed in a trippier state of mind and enjoying the experience more.
/n

And that second dose was kicking in fast and strong. I looked at a painting on the wall and saw that things were finally starting to get in motion. The visuals were flowing like mushrooms but sharper and sparklier, a bit like LSD. Soon the ceiling was squirming around in segments, which it always seems to do when I'm tripping, just in slightly different ways depending on the substance. I noticed the segments seemed larger than I was used to with acid trips, and the rhythm of their movements seemed unique.
/n
/n
I started feeling a little overheated, and might have even been sweating a little bit, so I said, 'I'm too hot.' and pointed a fan at myself and cracked the window (okay, actually my girl did this for me). After I cooled down a bit I was fine, and at a solid +++. I thought, 'I expected this to happen, that is why I took that dose' which was an interesting because I could not predict what it would be like, yet somehow this matched my prediction. I wanted to know if 4-aco-MiPT had much of a personality, so I examined the rhythm behind the movement of the ceiling, and other flowing or squirming visuals. It was actually hard to tell. With some psychedelics, like mushrooms or mescaline, there almost seems like there is a force with its own personality and intent 'behind' the drug. With DMT or Salvia it's in your face, with shrooms or mescaline it can be, and with something like LSD it only comes out on occasion or on higher doses. But it's there. I decided 4-aco-MiPT was a lot like LSD in this way. Also, perhaps whatever was behind the 4-aco-MiPT was actually controlling a different, natural drug. Like perhaps the mushroom entity had crossed frequencies with 4-aco-MiPT. And perhaps LSD was causing some telepathic interference. The drug felt like pure 'tryptamine'. I wonder how much my preconceptions made me think this way.

Our conversation laying in bed went from wacky and awkward, to hilariously insane or insightful, and occasionally to sweet and loving. Breifly sexy, and kissing was nice, and though we both agreed at one point that we were rather horny we also agreed that we weren't focused enough to do anything about it. At one point something funny was said, which may have been some kind of realization or admission about my own life (but I really don't know), and I busted out laughing for a good five minutes before I could keep a straight face. I thought this laugh was therapeutic at the time because I guess I haven't been laughing much lately. It certainly felt like a positive release of emotion at the time.
/n

At this point the ceiling was moving more drastically, giving the illusion of parts of it rising up or down in a trippy way a couple feet from it's normal height above me. My girlfriend's face took on the appearance of a tribal-looking mask before my eyes. But a very trippy one at that. I thought this was very fascinating, especially since this alteration was like a beautiful work of art based on her facial structure. Her face started to change shape a bit which was a bit weirder, so I closed my eyes to see what I would see.
/n
/n
And what I saw was energy, jumping around in a three dimensional plane, in different forms. Soon they formed a pattern, which turned into a psychedelic gothic pattern that was mostly red with blue outlines. It was all very electric and crystal clear. This pattern began to form the shape of a tunnel and soon became the walls of the tunnel. I looked to see what was at the end of the tunnel but it was unclear and distant. I opened my eyes again and told my girl to check out the show under her eyelids and she agreed it was a good show indeed. The tunnel had felt very 'holy' to me. The pattern was godly and really indescribeable I wondered if this was related to the DMT chrysanthemum, which I envisioned and understood as a bodyuniverse consciousness projection.
/n
/n
We discussed the sensation of energy flowing through our bodies, talked about what this energy might be. We agreed it was some kind of universal energy, and that we felt like transistors. We talked about religion and it was pretty deep at points. This discussion led us back to the question about what kind of energy we were feeling. She knew I was holding something back from my spiritual side but for some reason I did not feel it would be appropriate to say, 'I believe we have tapped into God energy, which is all of us. We are God.' But that is what I believed at the moment, and that is what I partially still do believe.

After what seemed like quite a while of all kinds of interesting and fun discussion, and just generally tripping out and enjoying ourselves on the bed, we noticed although time had seemed to move slowly, it was 12:00am, only three hours after dosing. I felt like I might actually be coming down slightly, at least from the most intense early part of the peak. I felt extra loving, jovial, witty, and like I had a fresh perspective on everything. My body felt good and like it was functioning more or less normally (I didn't find 4-aco-MiPT to be very speedy or sedating). We stood up, hugged, held hands and played with each other's balance. By this point I already felt as if this experience had been a bonding relationship of sorts, even after more than four years together with this girl, and probably more valuable and genuine than an MDMA experience with her in a lot of ways.
/n
/n
The idea of a drink was proposed but I decided not to disrespect the drug by taking advantage of a somewhat relaxed peak to have a drink. After all, just twenty minutes ago the last thing I needed was a drink. So I decided, still, the last thing I need is a drink. Apparently I did need to take a shit though, so I went and did that. The drug appeared to have made it runny, which was the worst effect of the drug as far as I was concerned. I still had nice visuals in the bathroom. I saw little red microscopic dots in the grout between the bathroom tiles. My girl described this same visual on the grey pillow in her room, and that surface alone. I thought it was neat that these dots were replicable for different people (and I saw them last time too) but only on certain surfaces.

After a little while we went downstairs and watched 80's music videos. Watching TV on the comedown was much like watching TV on an LSD comedown, which was extra meaningful and I was thinking about things in totally weird ways. I remember when 'Epic' by Faith No More came on the late night VH1Classic I was stoked. It was a kick ass video and the music sounded fantastic.
/n
/n
We watched TV, maybe a movie or something, I really forget, for a while, laughing at weird commercials and stuff. It was fun and I felt like I had gotten plenty of value out of the peak of the trip so I didn't think I was really wasting it. We each had poured a drink of coke and rum but we both let it sit in front of us for like one hour before I noticed neither of us had sipped our drinks yet. Now normally if we pour a drink it's gone in ten minutes tops. It was strange the 4-aco-MiPT seemed to make me reject booze. Upon noticing this we had a good chuckle and took our first sip together.
/n
/n
By the time I finished my drink I was still feeling a little stimulated in a tryptamine way, and still had minor visuals. This was 5-6 hours after dosing, and it felt like a cross between a shroom tail-end comedown and an acid tail-end comedown. Like a perfect mix. I consider the shroom comedown to be the easiest and most gentle of all psychedelics I've known. Acid can be drawn out and stimulating. It was a bit stimulating but gentle and I knew I could sleep soon.
/n
/n
Around 3:00am my girl was ready for bed. I wasn't quite, so I took about 15mg diazepam, smoked a bowl and sat in front of the TV for another hour or so until I was tired. When I went to bed I slept pretty easily.

The End
/n
/n
All in all I think this is the best 'research chemical' I've used, just narrowly beating out 2C-D because I like tryptamines better in general, and feel they tend to be deeper and gentler on my body. This stuff is definitely a good time, a few other friends all loved it. 14mg seems like a very light dose... 16-18mg a medium dose, 20-22mg a medium/high dose and anything above that can get pretty intense.</bodytext></report>
