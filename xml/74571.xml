Over the years I have used a variety of psychedelics, namely mushrooms, LSD, San Pedro, as well as DMT in a variety of forms, and a spattering of others, with cannabis featuring more regularly until recently.

HPPD is real. Ive never had what I would call a flashback, although on returning from the Peruvian Amazon, one night I woke up to find myself in an ayahuasca visionary trance for a few seconds. My experience of HPPD is really quite a subtle one; it doesnt cause me any distress and doesnt interfere with my life in any way. Sometimes I may say faint fractal patterns on things like the carpet or cloths for example, but these are very subtle. Against a backdrop of white, or looking at rippling water, I may notice a few subtle colours now and again. When Im on the train looking out with trees going past me, or on the road with street lamps acting as strobes with my eyes shut, I start to see fractal patterns. When its dark, I will often see little coloured pixels moving, or shimering slighlty. Looking into a fire also brings out these fractals. Cannabis definitely seems more psychedelic these days. Sometimes I may get tracers.

Thats about it really though. Nature seems more beautiful than ever, with sunrises and sunsets being particularly spectacular (mescaline sunsets). Clouds are an amazing canvas for the imagination; I have a newfound appreciation for them. Music has the ability to enrapture me on a new level. And, I do daydream a lot, but to be honest Ive always done that. So I cant really say anything negative about it. In fact, its very subtle, low level quality serves as a reminder of past experiences, and I would say my perspective on the world is actually an improvement on what it used to be.</bodytext></report>
