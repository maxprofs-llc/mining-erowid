I suffer from dust allergies which causes me a considerable amount of lethargy as well as other problems, to which i was diagnosed with psychological conditions and offered many pharms with not any considerably good side effects. I've stopped taking pharms for about a year now.

I recently acquired some 2C-E for the purpose of benifiting from both it's empathogenic and synergistic effects on the central nervous system along with cannabis to calm my immune system i expected positive results.

After two months of experimenting with it i thought i might contribute a few of my findings. Ideally i find 5-6mg 2-3 times per month counteracts many of the lethargic and depressive effects that my allergic symptoms exacerbate, as well some cannabis was vaporized in moderate quantities to compensate for the intensity, pain and nausea caused by the insufflation of 2C-E.

I find that the trip itself can be a little intense, however the side effects leave a healthful lasting impression on my body, no more lethargy, my cognitive abilities have also enhanced to some effect, as well to compensate for body load after the trip i take 5-HTP or possibly GHB if available.

A positive experience if kept at moderate doses, at higher doses eg. 8-13mg i find the level of unpredictable mood changes is elevated.</bodytext></report>
