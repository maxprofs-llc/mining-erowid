A friend (M) and I had the chance to take several days off from college and travel. While preparing to hike one of the most remote and beautiful sections of ocean coast in the 48 U.S. states (part of a national park), we decided to take some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds to enhance what should already be a very special experience. I am fairly inexperienced with  psychoactives, having tried 2C-E, 2C-I, morning glory, salvia, DXM, and nitrous in the past but only one or two trials of each substance. M has tried all these drugs in addition to LSD and mushrooms. Also, we had each tried very low doses of HBWR (2 seeds) which in the past had produced positive threshold effects. My strongest psychedelic experience so far would have to be the 20mg dose of 2C-E, which was a very strong trip. This trip consisted far less of lounging around listening to music than our typical excursions and far more physical activity.

Anyway, around 1:00pm I ingest five HBWR seeds (Hawaiian strain) simply by chewing and swallowing. M eats six, though he holds the seed grit in his mouth for 30 minutes or so before swallowing. I'd had almost nothing to eat that day. Neither of us experienced any real nausea, cramps, or other body effects--surprising considering HBWR's reputation and the unpleasant nausea we'd both experienced with morning glory. We didn't shave the seeds of bark or fuzzy coating. About half an hour after taking the seeds, we begin a nine-mile loop hike through dense forest and pristine wilderness beach. I didn't bring anything to measure time with, and there's really no point in guessing after this point because the time dilation was so strong. Effects slowly build up. M comments that the trail description didn't mention that the hike becomes more magical as you go along. The trail is wooden boardwalk for three miles leading through temperate rainforest and seems absolutely surreal, as if out of a storybook. Green overwhelms my vision and seems especially lush and vibrant.

As we approach the ocean, anticipation builds up and finally reaching the beach after the three miles was quite euphoric. It was truly one of the most pictureque scenes you could find in the United States, on psychedelics or not. This first part of the trail ends at a clearing with a view of the coast--ocean meeting steep forested hillsides--plus jutting rocks and gorgeous tiny islands in the distance. Some young deer roam freely around the area and seem entirely unfazed by our presence. There is a sense of connection with the simplicity and beauty of these creature's lives in the forest by the beach.

We continue hiking along the beach and come to a small hill jutting out from the mainland. We christen this place the 'Top of the World'. I was thinking about how this was the most beautiful place I had ever seen and wanted to take a picture, but whenever I tried to it seemed like I was missing an essential part of the scene. I told M, 'How can I capture all of reality in one shot?' I was near the peak around this time, though the time curve for HWBR means that peak effects lasted for quite a while longer. Mental effects were most prominent, though there were some visuals in the form of all the scenery generally moving around slightly and some patterning. There was little time to lie down and introspect or gaze at CEVs. Colors were definitely enhanced, too. My balance was somewhat messed up, but it felt good.

We continued hiking along the beach, and then the trip temporarily took a turn for the worse.. far worse. I started to get worried about the tide coming in and trapping us against the steep hills and cliffs. This was a real danger, but not for hours later and in reality the coming darkness was more worthy of my fear. We had been hiking for what seemed like way too long--we needed to find the trail back to the beginning (this was a loop hike). Obviously having good reason not to trust our sense of time passage, we continued further down the beach, and eventually M started to get worried too. We soon began getting extremely anxious about our situation... there simply wasn't time to get back to the first part of the trail before night and the tide trapped us. We seriously thought we might die out there, or have to spend the night freezing in strange and dangerous wilderness forest.

I continually thought I saw trailheads in the distance, which turned out to be nothing. At the peak of our fear--certainly intensified by the LSA--we came upon some backpackers, though from a distance I refused to believe it could really be people. This was extremely unlikely at the location; we're very lucky. We were very, very worried and must have seemed crazy to these guys. They told us we had hiked way too far and how to find the return trail. It was dark by the time we found it and were forced to hike three miles by flashlight. Visuals really intensified here in the pitch blackness. After finding the backpackers, our moods increased greatly and we were simply happy to be alive.

We made it back safely around 9pm. I had seriously overexerted myself, hiking 15 miles at a brisk pace after eating nearly nothing that day. I could hardly stay awake, started feeling tingling in my hands and feet, and then puked everywhere. This was probably due to the physical stress rather than any effects of the HWBR. Even by this time, lingering mental effects made sleep difficult despite our exhaustion.

Overall, this was definitely an experience! Other than that horrible period of well-deserved anxiety, the trip was positive, insightful, and really made me appreciate the value of life. We were somewhat surprised by the intensity of this average dose of HWBR and were glad we hadn't taken a higher dose, as we had considered. We probably would've freaked out even more and not known what to do. There's nothing like putting yourself in actual physical danger while on psychedelics.</bodytext></report>
