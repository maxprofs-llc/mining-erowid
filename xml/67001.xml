I have had nerve pain for years from a herniated disk.  I got some lyrica 50mg and 75mg samples from an old friend with benefits.  These pills are awesome with some green plant.  I have worked in the medical field and have experienced almost every narcotic (opiates and opiods) including fentanyl (china white) injections, dilaudid and nubain(nalbuphine) injections.  I would describe the lyrica/pot high as valiums mixed with lortabs.  I may nod off later on but I can focus better on these too.  They are prescribed for nerve pain from diabetes and fibromyalgia and other types of pain.
