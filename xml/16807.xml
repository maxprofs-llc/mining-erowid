I awoke yesterday, august 13th, 2002, not knowing what was going to happen.  I was with my girlfriend that day, doing some serious thinking about our relationship.  I decided it was time for an end, as we were both going to away to college.  I regrettably ended our relationship at probably around noon or 1pm.  As soon as she left I felt horrible.  I started to cut parts of my body to try to create pain.

I decided I needed to escape.

I went and picked up my friend.  We went and gathered a bunch of mushrooms from our colony.  Probably about 20 grams of dry shrooms, and over 10 or so grams of fresh ones.  I drove to my friend Mikes house (nobody was home), and began to eat the fresh shrooms.  It was probably around 4:40pm or so. Nothing was in my stomach for around 24 hours, I weigh 140lbs, and I have a high metabolism.  I dipped them in ranch dressing (I cant stand the fucking taste), and in about 15 minutes I felt the nausea begin.  (I have eaten shrooms before, but I barely tripped).  I knew from my previous experience that once the nausea began, I would trip pretty soon.  About 20 minutes later, I was still outside, and the grass began to have a wavy, ocean effect.  The tree had odd looking vines on it.  I went inside my friends house and sat on the couch.  I had the feeling of my body tensing up.  Suddenly, for a split second, one side of the room seemed to move away from me.  I moved to another couch, and that is when my girlfriend called.  She called my cell phone many times, but I didnt answer it.  I went into my friends bathroom, took a piss, and stared at myself in the mirror for about 5 minutes, because my reflection looked odd.

I went outside, called my girlfriend, told her I loved her a lot, started to feel bad, and drove home.  At this point I thought the trip was nearing its end (like the last time I tripped), and I just had a buzzed/stoned feeling.  I drove home (it must have been around 5:50pm according to my cell phonethere was some traffic also) and hoped to sleep it off. yeah right.  Once I got inside, (my mom was home) I went into my room and lay in bed.  I crawled under the covers and tried to shut my eyes.  I had a gassy/cramped feeling in my body and I started to get anxious.  I  began to see different green and light green visions (from what I remember).  I was getting a little freaked out because there was a constant sound of crickets at this pointthere are no crickets at this time of day.  My mom said she was going somewhere, I said OK, and shut my eyes again.

Suddenly the air conditioner came on, which created a vibrating, echoing noise.  I thought I heard some sort of odd thoughts in my head (similar to schizophrenia), and I just wanted the cricket noise to stop.  I said something out loud, and realized it had a echo or reverb effect to it.  I opened my eyes and I began to make noises with my mouth, because I was very interested in these noises.  I shut my eyes and odd, clear, tube-shaped rabbit looking creatures were there.  I watched them for a while.  This frightened me eventually and I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling.  The ceiling suddenly became a perfect pattern of Aztec-looking designs, all squared off evenly, with a mix of colors in their lines.  Every vision I saw at this point seemed to be even, blocked, shapes.  I then looked at my starry starry night painting, which morphed into one blue texture with the wall.  Throughout this whole time I was very schizophrenic, and agitated.

After this, it seemed to somehow be much later in the day, and my lamp began to bend and melt with a cushion.  I had become fed up with these visions, and took my wobble body into my basement.  There I tried to play my bass guitar (unplugged), and my trip seemed to be over.  I just seemed to be in a state of drunkenness.  After I was unable to play anymore, I eventually went back upstairs and sat on my bed.  I called my friend again (whose house I left earlier), and asked what he was doing.  I was about to go there again when I suddenly found my watch that I had disassembled earlier that week (just the band from one part of it).  I remember it seemed like I spent an hour trying to get that watch band back on, I couldnt do it, but I couldnt stop trying to get it to work.

Later, once again thinking the trip was over, I called my girlfriend, and asked her to come over.  We were sitting on my couch and her face began to turn green.  I was in the state of feeling like I was born again.  I told her I was tripping and she was about to leave.  Suddenly, when she was at the door, my face turned pale, I broke into a cold sweat, got dizzy, and ran into the bathroom.  I puked up about 4 or so shrooms.  I looked in the mirror and my eyes were DILATED like a mother fucker.  I sat against the bathroom wall to recover, shut my eyes, and saw sparkling, swimming, three dimensional green beads, flowing like water.  As I was talking to her, every time I shut my eyes I saw something different.  A paint brush and palette, various pictures, all very vivid and realistic.

She took me upstairs, and this is when the REAL tripping started.

She sat next to me, telling me how she thought about me all day, and all the good things about me.  I was finally in a better mood than before, and my visions were no longer frightening.  I was laying down, listening to her, and my eyes were shut.  I saw geometrical patterns of various metallic objects, usually glistening with a rainbow shine across them.  Shapes, eagles, and Indian, and other interesting things, all aligned perfectly geometrically, all shining with wonderful color.  I opened my eyes and looked at my little red light on my stereo.  I put my hand in front of my eye to cover it up, and my hand became transparent.  I could still see the light and its glow.

At this point, I was only seeing major visions while my eyes were shut, but they were very interesting.  I then began to think, instead of just sit and imagine images.  I had thoughts only of realization.  I saw myself as being an intelligent, grown person.  I felt I had realized how much I have grown, and thought of some of the things I thought as being very wrongsuch as leaving my girlfriend.  Listening to her, I had realized that she is a very wonderful person, and cared for me even when I was tripping (something she was against), and even while I was broken up with her.  About an hour or so later, the major tripping stopped.

When I shut my eyes I saw blackness, but sometimes a random image would appear.  When I laid next to and hugged my girlfriend, I shut my eyes and saw a forest, and then a group of vivid flowers.  I laid back down on my side, and shut my eyes.  I felt buzzed and realized I should get some food and water in my body, seeing how I did not eat or drink much, and threw up as well.
