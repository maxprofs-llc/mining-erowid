This report deals specifically with the smoked DMT/nitrous oxide combo and doesnt get into discussion on the effects of each material taken alone.  Im going to assume the reader is duly experienced in that regard.

I was speaking to a friend who informed me that he had been mixing DMT with nitrous.  He said that now he had tried the combo, he may never want to do DMT without nitrous again - it is simply, that, good.  Naturally it ended up on the top of my must try list.

Being a bit nervous my first time, I had decided to take it slowly.  However, my friend held the lighter up to the DMT pipe, and as Im inhaling hes saying, Go! Go! Take it, take it! More, more, more, TAAAAKE IT!  Im feeling unreasonably pressured, but respond by sucking in the largest lungful of DMT that I can manage and hold it in as my world slowly begins to dissolve.  As a storm cloud of DMT vapour bursts from my lips, the next thing I know hes jamming the nitrous dispenser in my mouth and saying Alright, now, suck it back and hold it in    I breathe in the nitrous as I feel the warm, oceanic shroud of DMT envelop me.  Im fighting off my nervous anxiety, but it quickly melts away as I slip into a thoroughly abstract psychedelic wonderland of indescribable complexity.

I was completely disembodied and flying through hyperspace in what amounted to a sort of mental orgasmic bliss.  I sat upright, eyes closed, rocking back and forth with a smile from ear to ear, mumbling only the words thank you to my friend for encouraging me (pushing me?) to go in so far.  There was no sense of fear, anxiety, discomfort  just an insane melee of colours and flashing lights.  There is almost no point in trying to describe it  its like trying to describe the shape of a colour and the colour of a sound.  As an alternative,  I will try to highlight the differences over my experiences with DMT alone.

For lack of a better description, I find the nitrous smooths out the DMT experience considerably.  Some of the more intense physical effects of the DMT are tempered, like the heaviness in the chest, the sometimes overwhelming rushy feel, the shortness of breath.  These all seem to be rendered rather inconsequential with the addition of the nitrous.  Its hard to feel the body load when there is no real sense of having a body.

Visually it is more intense than DMT alone.  The usual kaleidoscoping fractals, clown images and flashing lights explode in a fury of incomprehensible madness, as if moving into a fourth dimension.  Sound, colour and shape become almost indistinguishable, blending together in perfect synethesia.  If there are sounds in the room, I may hear them, but I may not be aware of what they are.  While I like either silence or music with smoked DMT and find talking to be disruptive, I found the ambient noise to be less important with the nitrous.  My giggling and chattering companions actually sounded (sounded?) fascinating to me.

Finally one of the more interesting effects from this combination is the tendency for the nitrous to prolong the effects of the DMT.  The linear curve of the comedown was much longer, with visuals still being present up to a half hour later.

Ive since tried this combo many times and find the materials to be remarkably synergistic.   My experiments with others have resulted in fully positive results, with not a single person finding the experience to be anything short of wondrous.  That said, its bloody intense and one should know what they are getting into before they try it.  Im always very careful with my set and setting, and have a great deal of respect for these materials.

Yes  I just may never want to smoke DMT without nitrous again - it is simply, that, good.</bodytext></report>
