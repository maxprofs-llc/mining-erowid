After studying amphetamine pharmacology extensively, I applied my knowledge of biochemistry (B.S. major) to attempt to enhance the effects of my ADHD medication Vyvanse (dextroamphetamine). L-tyrosine is a primary precursor to norepinephrine and dopamine, the two neurotransmitters amphetamines target (and deplete with extended use). I hypothesized the L-tyrosine would augment d-amphetamine's subjective effects if taken prior to the latter's administration by restoring the brain's stock of NE and DA.

I chose T-5:00 hrs prior to taking Vyvanse to administer the 1000mg L-tyrosine to allow time for digestion, enzyme conversion, and finally transport to neuron terminals.

At T+0:00 I took the 50mg Vyvanse. Began feeling amphetamine's influence at T+1:00 and at T+1:15 started to feel a more intense buzz than usual (daily usage of 50mg alone). At T+2:00, had a greater appreciation of music, felt like my hands and legs were innervated with more strength (similarly to the first few times I took amphetamine), and physically felt more stimulated (heart rate increased, talking faster, etc.)

T+2:30 reached the peak of euphoria which was noticeably better than when I take the Vyvanse alone. Felt even more sociable and focused, my reflexes were further augmented (subjectively by playing BF:Bad Company 2) and my heart rate peaked around 125bpm. Did not evaluate blood pressure but I imagine that was raised as well. Normally, my pulse peaks around 115-120 when on Vyvanse alone. Mouth was very dry, and I was craving coffee (but abstained for this experiment).

T+3:30 Felt noticeably warmer and was perspiring more than usual. Nothing serious or too unpleasant, and don't think it was weather related. Euphoria had decreased but still felt pleasant and had greater affection toward friends (compared to usual). Mouth was even drier than earlier and was clenching my teeth more than I normally did on Vyvanse. Had zero appetite, which was normal for amphetamines but I couldn't even force food if I tried.

T+5:00 Euphoria was no longer present but the physical stimulation was still in effect. I still felt pretty focused, and the dry mouth &amp; bruxism, along with elevated heart rate continued to persist. 
/n

T+7:00 Continued to have elevated focus and reflexes but less than earlier. Heart rate was about 110 now, the jaw clenching was less frequent but still there and the dry mouth less intense. Coffee craving was intense around this time but I stayed strong in avoiding it.

T+9:00 Signs of the amphetamine wearing off began to be apparent. Had a few bouts of isolated tiredness which subsided back into alertness. Appetite still felt suppressed but I could eat if I wanted. Pulse was still elevated around 110 though and oddly felt more jaw clenching than earlier. Had some mild nausea as well. 
/n

T+11:00 After eating a small dinner, had a mild headache which was the primary indication the amphetamine was pretty much gone or almost gone. Felt a bit irritable and grouchy too, another good indicator. Heart rate was down to 100 now. Was pretty nauseous at this point, but OK. 
/n
/n
T+16:00 No longer felt any influence from the amphetamine save for some mild insomnia. I was in bed at this time but ultimately fell asleep with a little effort. No ill effects from the come down were present at this time either. Waking up the next morning (T+23:00) also had no ill effects or unusual exhaustion. 
/n

Summary: I am convinced that taking the gram of L-tyrosine hours before my 50mg dose of Vyvanse augmented the drugs effects slightly (but significantly enough to mention). The euphoria lasted a bit longer and felt better than from normal usage. Did not feel much ill effects other than the usual come down either. Something worth trying in times when I have developed a bit of tolerance to my ADD meds.

I did not try successive/consecutive days of L-tyr + Vyvanse administration, nor did I try mixing those two plus several cups of coffee either. Seeing as caffeine and amphetamine potentiate each other when they're mixed, this may be an even better experience.</bodytext></report>
