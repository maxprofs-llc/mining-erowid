Got some of this stuff (dried flowers and leaves) from a new-age type store, and wanting to replicate some Hemingway and Van Gogh type stuff decilded to try it out.  I reached in the bag and put a handful of the bitter leaves inside my mouth, and chewed for a while, finally swallowing them

I noticed no beneficial or noteworthy effects, so much so that I thought that previous posters were tricked by a placebo effect, and that wormwood was not psychoactive at all.  It did make me a little queasy though.

Turns out I was wrong, because the next day I had a reaaaaally tough time waking up, I felt very tired and hazy for the first hour or so, and the feeling lingered throughout the day and into the evening.  Fanatastic, right?  Well, bottom line is I will need to research it in way more detail before I try something like this, because what ultimately happened was quite unpleasant, really.</bodytext></report>
