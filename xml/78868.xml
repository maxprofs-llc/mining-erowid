Well I've done dxm plenty of times, probally to many. Well it had been about a year since I had done it last and decided to give it another go.  Well I did and E benged on it for 3 days.  First day I used robotussin 20 gel caps, then the next 2 a pack of ccc a day.  Well the trips were good and nothing to significant happened but at the end of the third time I felt like I had horrible blue balls and then the pain moved up to my spine then kidney area.  I had no idea what it was, I thought I pulled out my back or I was having liver failure.

Well that day I just lied in bed all day hoping it would pass.  The next day came and it was worst I could barely walk.  I got up and pissed and it burnt a little and 2 small freckle sized objects were in the water.  I went to the hospital and the doctors pretty much diagnosed me with kidney stones and they said I may had already passed them, which I did.  The kidney pain slowly faded away after a day or 2.  I would like to know if I didn't take that shit would I have passed the kidney stones?  Would they still be in me growing making it harder for me to pass them later on?  But then again maybe it was the reason I had them in the first place.</bodytext></report>
