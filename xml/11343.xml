Okay, let me first start off by saying that I have heard of amphetamine pshycosis...I mean haven't we all.  But I never knew it could happen with the lower-grade, over the counter stimulants.

Friday, I decided I would binge on Super Stinger pills all day at school.  Super Stingers contain 200 mg of caffeine, 25mg of ephedrine, and some geinsing.  Anyway, I popped 1 the normal dosage every four hours starting at 8:00 am.  The effects of the Stingers were the usual of that type of stimulant.  A general up-lifting feeling and a very small euphoria.  Well, after school I went to a friends house and decided I would continue my pattern of 1 every four hours and stay up all night.  I took one every four hours because about that time the major effects of the drugs would wear off and I would end up coming down..which sucks on Stingers.

I ended up staying up all night and then stopped taking the Stingers at 12:00 pm the next day.  I went home and boy was I tired...I felt ready to drop.  I had my high and low points but as it turned out I was at the house alone that night.  About 8:00 pm things started getting bad...I would go outside and see certain things out of the corner of my eyes and hear faint sounds.  I was somewhat paranoid about what was happening but I would just go back in and watch some TV.  I was very detached until I decided about 11:00 pm to go to bed.

All in all, I had fun.  I wouldn't recommend taking any substances to school like I did.  It could lead to a very bad situation and who wants that in this day and age.  Have fun...stay safe...keep cool.
