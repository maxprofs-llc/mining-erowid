I have a 100 mg a day oxycontin habit so when I run out the withdrawls are real tough. I find snorting 300 mg of lyrica completely gets rid of the jones. It doesn't get me real high or anything just relaxing. This drug has saved me from hard WD many times. It's real easy to get around here in new england. I like having a few on hand for when I run out of my opiates.</bodytext></report>
