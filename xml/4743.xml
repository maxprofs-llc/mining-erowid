At a small new years party, I tried smoking some salvia divinorum 5x, during the last third of an e roll. The salvia trip put me into a very confused head space for about 30 minutes, which is much longer than the average salvia trip. I also got a significant increase in OEV, fractal patterns, which I ordinarily don't get on salvia alone. The salvia seemed to overpower, no, obliterate, the MDMA feeling, and once I came down off the salvia, I was also completely sober, thinking to myself that Salvia and ecstasy don't really work together for me.</bodytext></report>
