I am recovering from minor depression, I have been for quite some time.  I also used to have some 'anxiety issues'.  So, technically I have been diagnosed with 'generalized anxiety disorder/ depression'.  Effexor XR at 300 mg really helped out with the anxiety and depression, I still feel better today.  But, I felt still slow (my demanding school schedule requires me to study, study, study).  So, my psychiatrist prescribed me Adderall.  At first I tried the XR.  In a few months, I was up to 30 mg XR (2 times a day x 15 mg).  But, I was displaying symptoms of minor manic behavior (more irritable, over aggressive, eating more than usual, needing to stretch a lot more than usual).  Then, I switched to 30 mg of generic Adderall (10 mg, 3x day).  But, still had manic symptoms.

My shrink thought I was 'minorly bipolar' which means that I get a little depressed without some stimulation.  But, I go overboard when given amphetamines or caffeine.

So, I wanted to try Provigil.  I cut out the amphetamines 'cold turkey' (that was quite hard to do).  Yesterday, and the day before that, I had 200 mg.  Today, I did a little more (I still was feeling quite drowsy in class).

I admit, I did feel very alert.  I did not feel 'restless' as with Adderall.  I did not feel the compulsive 'need to accomplish'.  I did not feel my body temperature rise and a desire to eat everything in sight.  Let's see what the results are.  That's what truly matters.

It did not raise my IQ (mine stays the same no matter how many times I take the IQ test), the drugs did not increase test scores (I actually had a 4.0 before taking any of this stuff), and I feel more distracted when studying.</bodytext></report>
