Last night I smoked a bowl of weed and california poppy and it was pretty good. The poppy smoke was a little harsh but not too bad. It produced an extra chill and relaxed feeling that affected my body a bit more than just weed. As it wore off I got pretty tired, more so than normal. There was a definate difference in the high. I think I will try it again to get a better sense of any legitimate effects.</bodytext></report>
