I remember the first time I ever tried ambien, my friend came over to stay for the weekend and brought some of his with him, (10mg's each). He suggested that I try it with him, he had told me that it was extremely fun, so I did. We both popped 1 pill each, for me the effects have never taken more than 20 minutes to kick in. The high is always very pleasurable for me, and I have been using ambien to get high for over 4 months, I have somewhat built up a tollerance for it, as did my friend but he stopped using it for a month and then started again and the tollerance had completely vanished, like he had never taken it before.

The high, on 10mg:
/n
slight double vision, very talkative, good mood, not shy, a good numb body high, physical activities are very fun and I've also noticed that when I am around people, the high somewhat intensifies, I have found it to be very pleasurable.
/n
/n
20mg:
/n
quite a bit of double vision, good mood, slight loss of coordination, still very talkative, not shy AT ALL, I could tell your deepest darkest secrets to a complete stranger, a very good body high. 
/n
/n
30mg:
/n
extreme double vision, good mood, extreme loss of coordination, still very talkative, no shy at all like always, this high is quite risky as 30mg is quite a bit.

I've noticed something somewhat weird with all the doses that I've taken with ambien, its weird but fun. I've noticed that if I lay down and close my eyes and think about a certain thing long enough the image will form in my head, and I've actually caught myself talking to people that I've seen.</bodytext></report>
