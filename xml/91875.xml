JHW-122 is a pretty potent JHW, at doses of 3-5mg it will get me pretty stoned. I come up a little slow at first, but then it slams me. It has a strong body buzz and with a minor trippy/psychedelic effect. At higher doses such as 5-6mg the psychedelia increases. CAUTION: It does increase my heart rate quite a bit, and can give me minor tremors/twitching. People have reported seizures at high doses of 018 and 122.

There are a few JHWs that can be tested for, got caught on probation smoking certain spices or analogs 122, 018, am2201, and a few others are testable for.</bodytext></report>
