Well I started the night out just wanting to get fucked up because I couldn't get any real normal drugs that I usually do, so I did tons and tons of internet research on my dads migraine medication, topamax. I couldn't find a single report on the drug being used for recreational useage so I decided to make my own and try it out for myself.

I took a random (never a good idea) 225 mg of the topamax and felt such a dissociation and out of body trip it was unbelievable. Of course there was an annoying ungodly state of confusion. I remember a few times feeling as though the walls were caving in on me and having quite a few out of body experiences. It was definantly fucked up.</bodytext></report>
