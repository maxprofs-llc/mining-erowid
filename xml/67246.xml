Hey I'm 15 years old and I've had some messed up reoccurring experiences with marijuana. I have tried salvia several times, but I've never witnessed any paranormal things happening in real life. The first time I tried salvia was about 3 months ago with some buddies and I've done it about 5 or 6 times all in one week. I smoke weed for fun with my friends just about every week but recently (starting about a month ago) I've been 'living' my dreams. Any night that I fall asleep high I have wild dreams that I never remember about the next day, which is pretty normal. The screwed up part is that the next time I'm high I go into like a weird dream world that is actually the dream I had the last time I was asleep high.

I tried looking up if smoking weed had anything to do with being able to predict the future in your dreams but the only thing that was related to that was salvia and deja vu. This has happened about 10 times or so over the past month and each time I get high, I experience more an more things about the most recent dream I had. The last time I smoked (about 3 days ago) I could predict everything that was about to happen in perfect detail about 10 seconds before they actually took place. That very moment I also realized that my dreams get more realistic each time. Has anyone else had this happen to them? I'm curious to find out if it might have to do with all of that salvia I smoked a couple months ago.</bodytext></report>
