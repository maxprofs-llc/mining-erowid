Now, let me say something, my alias isn't Jspeedy because Im a speed freak, in fact I've only touched any amps twice in my life.

Well for awhile I had wanted to get a couple of 20 mg adderall from a friend. After a week, I was finally able to get some and that day was earlier today. I've had experience once with methylphenidate-Ritalin, in the form of 5 mg pills. I liked those, they made me stay wide awake in school and focus everything in on class work. The only problem I found with methylphenidate was that it's out of my system within half the time of dextro-amphetamine, my guesstimate would be 4-6 hours half life. I ended up crashing before the day was even over, not fun. Coming off of an amphetamine is a very uncomfortable feeling. Mentally I feel worn out, like I havent slept in awhile, almost like staying up for a day or two, not being able to sleep. I didn't worry about sleep when I took Ritalin, because by the time I was coming down, it was the end of the day so I could simply go home and rest.

So once I got home with the 40 mgs of adderall, I used the restroom, went in my room, and shut the door. Prepping for insuffulation, I crushed each individual pill using a metal bottle cap, worked very well. I railed one pill and my nostril burnt for about 5 minutes later, perhaps it wasn't fine enough of a powder, though I was sure there werent big chunks in the pile, no signs of bleeding.

Allowing the chemical to take hold, I sat back at my desk and chilled out looking on the forum I frequent. About a minute or two later, I taste the drip so I retrieve some water from my bathroom to clear my palate after each glob of mucus disgusts my tongue. Effects begin to take effect gradually as 5 minutes pass. Once 10 minutes have passed, I feel more alert, and I'm focusing in on every detail around me. Once my nostril is done burning, I shoot half of the other pill in the latter nostril, and then eat the other half. This was around 4:10 PM when all of the adderall was in me.

Around 6 or so PM, after forcing myself to finish my plate at dinner and having a good chat with my parents, I go smoke a bowl of weed and that adds a great effect. I'm a chronic marijuana smoker, I smoke at least twice a day on an average day. At first when I was getting used to the adderall, even though I felt no signs of euphoria, I didn't have an urge to smoke. I decided to see what adderall and sweet leaf would be like. It took me almost 3 minutes to finish a gram or so of mids, usually I take 5 to 10 minutes, but this time the smoke heating my throat didnt bother me, and I was able to maintain sucking it down. As I walked back to my room, I felt the two drugs fuse.

After smoking weed I'll feel lethargic and unmotivated. Well the adderall filled those two spaces and the feeling was quite unique. The familiar stoned feeling filled my head, but I didnt feel like sitting at my desk playing video games as I usually do whilst stoned, instead I studied for my final exams I have to take later this week. After chilling out studying and talking to people on my computer, I picked up my bass to see if I could possibly play faster with more precision. Was I right? Damn straight. I spent an hour and a half doing nothing but playing my bass, just practicing whatever songs I perform with my band and playing some tunes by Red Hot Chili Peppers.

After practicing some bass, I took a shower which really gave me more energy, the warm water felt relaxing, washing my hair was fun, lathering my hair is usually a mundane thing to me, but the adderall made me appreciate the feeling more. Now, I'm hear finishing up my trip report. I had always thought of making a report but was too lazy. Adderall = no lazy.

I can defiantly see the addiction potential in dextro-amphetamine. Adderall is different than Ritalin, a lot. Adderall wires me longer, about double the duration of methylphenidate. People may say they get high off of adderall, that didn't occur for me. I felt no significant euphoria at all like I subtly did with Ritalin. A sense of well being was defiantly imminent, as since I dosed (over 7 hours later) I have felt more social and more open to speaking. Adderall makes me talkative. It's controllable, but I don't want to fight it. Having a deep talk with a friend makes time fly while under the influence. I now understand how people could grow an addiction in the way it makes me much more motivated to work or study. As I pointed out, I didn't notice or anticipate any euphoria, though some people claim they do achieve a euphoric state similar to cocaine at higher doses.

Hours have passed since dosing, and I'm still alert and focused, in fact if it werent for adderall there would be no way I could have done this at 11:20 PM. I would recommend adderall for anyone looking to really hit the books and cram for a final, or get a term paper done. Pretty much anything you can think of which requires mental problem solving or even physical activity can be enhanced with adderall. I can see myself possibly taking it before a show to improve my playing, but I would use it sparingly as amphetamines are just plain bad on your heart. Although I usually hate writing, I'm pretty good with words, once the thought of me writing a report came to mind, I decided to spend an hour writing a good experience. Here I am now, about to take some of my prescribed ambien to help me get to sleep.</bodytext></report>
