I've done coriciden many times before and I only had one bad trip on 20 pills. It felt like I was seriously dieing and I thought I was too cool. I did it for about 2 months straight and started gettin really bored of it so I thought I would do a little suntin stronger.

I found this person who sells DXM and they get it straight from the Government so it was my second time doing it and I was in in school suspension with no work so I thought I might do it so I wouldn't be so bored and not have anything to do. So I put it down my throat and about 45 minutes later I started trippin and feelin really good like yeah can't get any better than this. So it was lunch time and I tried to eat but I could only get down 2 fries and threw my lunch away.

That's when I started feeling really pukey and I layed my head down on my desk and that's when I started puking all over the floor and all over my desk. The teacher had sent someone to come and get me to the nurses office and I can only remember a little bit about what happened. I remember teachers asking me what did you take Morgan? And what are you on and I only told them I was real sick and next thing I know I'm in the ambulance.

I remember laying in the ambulance and them asking me why I'm crying and are you in pain. I couldn't even talk I was so fucked up. They Had to strap me down because I was shaking so bad and I felt like I was dying or something cus it felt like I was going into these warp zones or different worlds. I remember getting lifted off the stretcher and onto a hospital bed when we had arrived there. I remember screaming Daddy I love you and daddy don't leave me I'm so sorry daddy and flipped out when he tried to leave the room. My stomache was almost pumped and the doctor said I had almost went into a coma.

I don't think I have ever been any scared in my hole Life. To this day I won't ever touch any drug cept for weed and I know that won't kill me. I'm too young to die. I'm only 16 and have my whole life in front of me.

The person I had got the DXm from must have laced it because when the doctor had come back with my piss tests he said I was tested positive for PCP. And I don't know how becasue I never tried it before. After about 6 hours in the hospital I finally started to come around and the doctor said I was alright to go home. And this is the story about how I over dosed in school.</bodytext></report>
