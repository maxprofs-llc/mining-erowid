I created this stuff one day and decided I would test it.

At about 11:30  a smoked all of it in one sitting. After a while I started to get worried that it might be dangerous. This fear soon passed.  And about 15 minutes later I felt funny.  I felt like everything was really open and big. At about 12:00 The colors of everything started changing and objects were distorted.  I was sort of airy. At 12:15 the colors stopped changing and I just felt wonderful.  It seemed like everything that happened was good. This continued for another hour.  At 1:30 I felt really cold.  And I was incredible tired.  I took a nap.  I had thousands of weird dreams. and the I woke up completely refreshed at 2:45.  All in all Mixture #9 is really one of the coolest drugs I've ever done.  And its completely legal.</bodytext></report>
