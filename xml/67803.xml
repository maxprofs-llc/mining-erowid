Ok I must say as per the title this was my first and last time doing GHB in the past I have used acid and mushrooms quite alot and as much as I love doing them I have decided to cease all drug use and so this is the story of my overdose.

I went to meet my friend on friday evening we went for dinner and then back to his place to hang out. His room mate dropped some GHB if I had to guess I'd say it was about a 1/2 cup so my friend threw back a cap and then offered me some. It seemed interesting to try out so I figured why the hell not however I wasn't thinking that the two of us had already had a couple glasses of wine each. So I threw back a cap and we were just laying there listening to music after a while we each threw back another cap and I remember him falling asleep and the next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital. I have vague memories of what seem like dreams about not being able to breath and then struggling to wake myself but not being able to. I'm pretty sure this is when I was in my friend's apartment. I got the rest of the story when I went back to his place to pick up my things and he told me everything that happened.

Apparently he woke up from his g-hole and found me on the floor in his bathroom barely breathing and he kept an eye on me for a while and called 911 when I started convulsing. So the medics arrived and did the whole rundown of what happened etc and also the cops came by I assume because it was drug related and from what my friend told me it took 5 people to hold  me down and strap me to the spine board. I woke up in the hospital at about 6:30AM strapped to the bed with a breathing tube down my throat and to keep me from moving around they shot me full of paralytics so when I did wake up I was unable to move or open my eyes and none of the nurses/hospital staff told me I had a breathing tube down my throat so I still had no idea what was going on. At this point eventually a nurse came over and did the squeeze test where they see if I can squeeze their fingers  and give a thumbs up and as soon as I did that they gave me my stuff back, checked if I could stand and walk alright and sent me home on the bus. Now I can understand hospitals not liking overdose patients or having more important things to do but in my opinion that's poor practice sending someone who has been chemically paralyzed for about 3-4 hours home on a bus with no escort.

After thinking on what occurred I think I've got it. I normally keep a bottle of water next to my bed and I think I woke up half fucked and sleeping and slammed the rest of the G thinking it was water then realizing what I did ran to the bathroom to try and puke it up cause my friend told me when I got back to his place that the bottle was empty when he found it.

So anyway thats the story of my overdose in conclusion my friend and also myself have agreed to stop doing drugs all together he explained it to me as such it took seeing someone OD to fully drive home what happened to him when he OD'ed on heroin about a year ago. As advice to anyone who is interested in trying GHB I do not recommend it the risk and ease of overdose if far greater than the short high I got from it.</bodytext></report>
