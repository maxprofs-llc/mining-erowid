I used to use BDO (1,4-butanediol) alot. I had heard that it is physically addictive as GHB is. It was very cheap, a 125 ml bottle cost around 15 USD. And I used dosages that were from 2 ml to 10 ml. The few first times it was very pleasant. I could feel the high coming on slowly. I mixed the 99.7 pure BDO in juice, a teaspoon in a cup. And drank that horrible shit down. I used it every day for weeks. I'd drink a few ml every second hour or so. Soon I started to get really sick of beeing high for long periods at once, so I began to take it only once a day.

One big hit a day. And at higher doses, like 15 ml, i'd get weird side effects. Like spasms in my arms and vomiting and amnesia. So I stopped using BDO. But I never experienced any withdrawl symptoms, nor did I ever feel either physically or mentally addicted.

All that I really learned from this is that BDO freezes at +17 C and becomes solid. So you can put it in the fridge and then put the solid stuff in gel caps.</bodytext></report>
