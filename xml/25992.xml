Ive read a lot on the topic of Datura and am well versed in herbs and plants as a herbalist for over twenty years now. I decided that I would make an extract using jimson weed. I cut up into small pieces both the seed pods and the leaves. Placed about three grams of this into a small glass jar and added alcohol. I let this mixture cure for a few days shaking it a few times a day. The ratio of alcohol to plant matter was about 2 to 1 or twice as much alcohol as plant matter. I used regular alcohol (rubbing).

I then after a few days took and added a few drops of peppermint extract like you use for cooking to kill the odor and taste. I took an eyedropper and extracted some of the extract and put it on a regular cigarette. It only takes about five minutes for this to dry because of the alcohol. I smoked the stuff.

The feeling I got was that of lifting of my spirit. Happy, warm body rushes similar to but not as strong as acid or mushrooms. Sexual stimulation was also a factor (erection) and a general feeling of well being was present. This was all good!  I decided to make the extract stronger by taking the plant matter while still in the alcohol and 'smashing' it with a blunt tool (I used the butt of a screwdriver). This caused the alcohol to pull out more of the oils from the plant. I again used the eyedroper to extract this and coat a cigarette.  The effect was more intense and I was having a lot of feelings of grandure and sexual stimulation. Euphoric and flighty and very happy.  This was nothing but a good feeling to me with no ill effects. I continue to use this now on a regular basiss. My friends who dont know of my use of jimson weed all swear that I am happier, more upbeat, and generally more pleasant?

I also notice in the morning when I get up I feel less sluggish and am more active and coherent quicker. This is quite a contradiction to the bulk of information I have read on Datura.  I took the same procedure listed above and did it with 'Angels Trumpet' which is also in the Datura family and had totally different and very 'unpleasent' effect? It seams that the Jimson weed works great for me but the angels trumpet does not. The angels trumpet causes tightness in my stomach, jerky muscle action,tightness in my chest, shortness of breath, and a headache. All this was done with the same amount of angels trumpet as the Jimson weed so I thought the angels trumpet was a higher level of datura in the plant so I cut back and made the extract with half the amount of plant and got the same bad effect only weaker?

I would have to say on a physical level that the Jimson weed and I are friends and its balance of various alkaloids is better for me than the ratio and balance of the angels trumpet. I am very pleased with the Jimson Weed extract with one exception. It is a little to enticing and its effect does linger a bit to make me a little spacey but for me thats good as im to serious anyway.</bodytext></report>
