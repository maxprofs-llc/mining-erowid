Recently a friend of mine found a full bottle of about 50 400mg tablets of Skelaxin in the back of his medicine cabinet. My friend was going to smoke a bowl of pot, but I am currently undergoing weekly drug tests, so I decided to try the Skelaxin.

The bottle said to take 2 tablets 3 times a day, so I took 5 with a glass of water (3:30pm). By 3:45pm, I was starting to feel a /n different, but not that different. I had noticed that my feet, my ass and hands had all fallen 'asleep', (tingly), and that I was experiencing a really euphoric body buzz.

By around 5:00pm, I had noticed that the effects of the pills were gone. Needless to say, tommorow I am going to go get the rest of that bottle.</bodytext></report>
