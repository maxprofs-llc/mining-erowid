I got my opportunity to try 5-MeO-DMT this past weekend when my order from an Internet chemical supply store was finally shipped. The 100mg enclosed in a small plastic ziplog bag were tiny grains of light yellowish brown crystals. My friend J and I had planned our trip for several months, ever since he talked about his first experience with the drug. J had tried an estimated 2.5mg once before. Ive spent many hours researching about this chemical found in Bufo alvarius toad venom. I drove up to my former hometown in central California and picked a late Friday afternoon to begin the experiment I was both excited and nervous about. We set the meth pipe and the 5-MeO-DMT on top of a mirror and approximately divided the 100mg by cutting the piles in halves each time as best we could till we each had the estimated amount of 12.5mg. By the way, I realized is it inaccurate to measure doses with the naked eye.

We each took nearly two-thirds of our piles (about 7.5mg) as our initial dosages. Having some experience smoking crystal meth, I carefully placed the substance in the glass bubble, heated it into a liquid, and inhaled the smoke very slowly and deeply. I didnt get much for my first hit, but I did feel a little dizzy and light. After one minute, I confirmed that I was absolutely fine and minimally affected because I probably didnt get a satisfactory hit. My friend J couldnt wait and took his turn immediately. The same dosage and preparation, except for one huge difference: his method of inhalation. He freebased the 5-MeO-DMT as I did, but held in the smoke (like smoking cannabis) for a good ten seconds. I anxiously asked him if it had worked, and he didnt respond at first. His breaths were very deep, eyes were blank, and J finally mumbled that he felt like he took some anthrax. Two minutes later he got up and shook off the feeling and swore to never touch the stuff ever again.

Despite seeing Js state of mind, I was even more anxious to try again with the same dosage. I realize the potential to easily take too much, but I didnt really care. As J slowly came back to reality, I continued to smoke the 5-MeO-DMT like I would speed, very slowly without holding the smoke in. More proficient this time, I was able to exhale a thick cloud of smoke. I waited for a few moments and began to feel some mild psychedelic sensations that mostly resembled LSD, but with hints of ketamine and ecstasy. However, the universe did not unfold in front of me nor did I feel even close to dying. It was familiar psychedelic territory. I felt blissful, peaceful and in control. I was able to stand up and walk around and talk bluntly honest with J, but felt euphorically lethargic somewhat. I did sense the void, but nothing too overwhelming. I wanted to freebase more because Id forgotten how fun it is to smoke from glass. J told me I smoked probably five or six more times (I vaguely remember), and achieved two very good hits and two decent hits. Can this substance be addictive? He was greatly surprise about my reaction, as I was.

I never got the intense near-death rush that Ive heard many people talk about. Sometimes people just don't hold the vapor in their lungs long enough for thorough absorption. Unfortunately, I wasted about 50mg of the exotic chemical. I will say that although I was very wasteful and reckless, there were some interesting revelations even with the minimal intensity. Within an hour, J returned to baseline, but it took me three hours to feel normal again (although this is hard to verify since our party continued with Belgian beer and high grade bud).

Four days later, I put the 5-MeO-DMT on top of some bud and smoked it. This morning was probably the worse possible date to choose since I had many things to do. But I was still curious and felt this would be my last opportunity to experiment again before my family vacation. I tried the new method with my little brother as the trip sitter (who knows nothing about the chemical). I was confident that I had some immunity or low sensitivity, and so I piled on a dosage close to 10mg. I proceeded outside to smoke, and this time I held it in my lungs for nearly twenty seconds. Within seconds, I had similar sensations like the other night, but this time the trip resembled more nitrous oxide feeling. I felt like I was going to die. Yes, it worked! The feeling was definitely rushing with the feeling that I couldnt breath. I definitely felt like I was poisoned. According to my brother, he said that for about five minutes, I couldnt stop saying, Oh my God! or panicking about death being so close. There were no obvious visuals, although I could have easily created some in my mind. But at this mental state, hallucinations didnt interest me at all. I was more drawn in by the energy and the void that was obviously felt this time. It felt like countless brain cells were dying and it would be inconceivable to return to baseline within an hour.

This was now definitely the most intense experience of my life. The feeling was like dying on inhalants, but without the nausea or discomfort. About ten minutes later, the peak was over and it felt strikingly similar to Fridays experience, mildly euphoric and goofy. The psychedelic feeling was still present, but not overly intense like earlier.

In the back of my mind, I did believe Fridays attempt was not the full-blown experience (despite using so much) because of the way I inhaled the chemical. Todays experiment verifies this notion. I will probably repeat this experiment once more since I have some left for one more trip. By the way, I no longer believe that 5-MeO-DMT is addictive.</bodytext></report>
