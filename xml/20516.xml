I take 500 mg. Serzone and 2 mg. Xanax for depression and anxiety. I take them both at night. I also drink fairly heavily; at least two drinks a night. I was unable to tolerate the side effects from Wellbutrin, Prozac, Topomax, Effexor, Anafril, Paxil, Buspar or Ativan.

The Serzone does not work as well as it used to and I have put on a lot of weight. I have had to increase the dosage quite a bit since I started. Aside from the weight gain and wishing it worked a bit better, Ive been happy with it.

The only side effect I have is when I drink more than a drink or two. Then sometimes first thing in the morning I see trails. For example if my arm passes through my field of vision, I see a light trail following it. I also feel pretty out of it and hung-over for an hour or two.

Its the cream of the crap as far as Im concerned, since Ive had either a lot of agitation or total lethargy with other antidepressants. Serzone does not give me any sort of pleasant high, but I dont feel the agitation or lethargy either.</bodytext></report>
