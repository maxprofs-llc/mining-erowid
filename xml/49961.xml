Ive been a chronic drug user of one sort or another since my early teens.  For most of my life the drug of choice has been pot, or any derivative thereof.  While I quit smoking cigarettes twice now, I always end up putting tobacco into my joints, which after a while, started to lead to some long-term paranoia.  After lighting up Id start freaking out about how Im slowly killing myself etc.  To make a long story short, I decided to finally quite smoking pot.  I still use it in various edible forms, but not every day.  However, the abstinence had some strange consequences.  I became much more interested in other drugs.  Ive always had a predilection for downers.  Ive chipped at heroin a bit, used valium recreationally, pot chronically, alcohol on occasion.  You get the idea.

Anyway, not having hook up for any hard opioids, I thought Id give the codeine thing a try.  I had a root canal procedure and was prescribed a very generous amount of T3s.  At the time I didnt think about it much, as I was still smoking, but now the pill bottle has become rather interesting.  I like to think of myself as a rather safe (and paranoid) user.  I started off with 2 T3s on an empty stomach just to try.  I had absolutely no tolerance and found the effects quite pleasant.  Relaxing, but also subtle, as most of the other reports have described.

The following week (I have a once a week rule with opiods, i.e., I dont use more than once a week) I tried 3 T3s and 4, 222s.  (222s are a Canadian OTC brand containing 8mg codeine, caffeine, and acetylsalicylic acid (i.e. aspirin)).  I had heard that the euphoric effects didnt manifest below 100 mg of codeine and thought this might be a nice next step to see if I could experience anything more significant.  For this, however, I used the codeine-extraction method.  I know I didnt need to because the ACET/aspirin does werent high enough, but like I said, Im paranoid.  I lay down to watch a movie with my girlfriend.  I had also dosed on an empty stomach.  I noticed the first effects within half an hour of drinking the codeine-water.  The effects were much like taking two T3s but stronger.  I was more relaxed, more calm.  There was about 5 minutes of true euphoria, but then that was gone not to return again on that trip.  I have to add that I noticed the effects more when I got up and walked around than lying down.  I also had a crampy stomach, not really pain, but not necessarily pleasant.

The next time I did an extraction using 7 T3s.  If I didnt lose too much codeine I should have had around 200mg (210mg if it was perfect) in the water.  Of course, there is no way to tell, but I certainly had more than in either of the two previous tries.  About 10  30min in I felt even more calm, and more relaxed than the last time.  Again I was lying down, and again, when I got up I really felt it.  There was no euphoria to speak of though.  This might also have been because 1. I didnt follow my once a week rule and may have had some tolerance, and/or 2. I didnt extract as much as I thought.

The problem came later.  I was trying to go to sleep about three hours after dosing.  I couldnt.  Not only could I not sleep, but my heart was pounding like crazy.  I thought it would pass and tried to ignore it.  I wasnt able to, and started to panic a bit.  I knew I hadnt taken nearly enough ACET/aspirin (even if I hadnt done the extraction) to OD, but yet, I was sweating, my heart was beating out of my chest, and my thought I heard ringing in my ears.  These are classical OD symptoms for ACET/aspirin.  Of course, I wasnt OD-ing.  I was rushing on the caffeine which cant be filtered out in the codeine extraction.  This was rather unpleasant.  My body was very relaxed, but by CNS was screwed on caffeine.  I dosed at 9pm, and managed to get to sleep at around 4am.  I had to work the next day.

Knowing now that I was not OD-ing, I will gladly to it again.  However, I dont think I will do much more than 200 mg of T3s unless I can get some without caffeine.  One more note:  the constipation really sucks.  I usually plan on not taking a shit the next day, and sometimes for more than that.  My friend, however, has diarrhea whenever she doses T3s, so you may want to reckon with either.

All in all worth doing.  Perhaps heroin or opium is a better buzz and in the end, less hassle, but for a cheap nice easy enjoyable night T3s certainly do the trick.</bodytext></report>
