The night started around 9:00 pm when me, my roomate, and another friend dosed on foxy.  We'd been smoking pot all day and continued smoking throughout the trips.  I swallowed the pill and went to set up the video camera which taped most of our trip.  About 9:30-9:45 I start to get really happy and can feel slight body effects so I sit down with a guitar and play a bunch of really random silly songs.

About 10:00 my trip started to kick in and I was feeling really euphoric.  I leaned over to write a message on our dining table and by the time I got done writing, my world had gone insane.  I completely lost track of time and visuals were everywhere.  I felt almost a sort of tenseness in my chest that kind of pulsated all over my body.  The only thing I could compare it to is the feeling you get achieving orgasm.  Only, it didn't die off.  It made me giggly and weird and I wanted to move around and hug things.

In my mind, I kept going over things that were happening around me.  For example, I was obsessing over why I couldn't attend an all girl party next door.  I came up with a million obsurd reasons like thinking they all hated me and that's why.  Not giving thought to the fact that I was a male.

Come about 5 am, I took another strong dose, and had a trip slightly less intense and somewhat shorter, although generally the same.  Before I could completely come down, I dosed on about 3 grams of shrooms and had a pretty intense shroom trip.  The trip didn't give me the normal body high, but the visuals were crazy.

After being strung out for so long on hallucinagens, I eventually just smoked a bowl and passed out for 15 hours.</bodytext></report>
