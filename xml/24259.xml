A few years ago I had the chance to taste this rather exotic tryptamine. I only got one capsule containing 15 mg, so I couldn't share the experience with friends. Rather than tripping with friends on different substances, I decided to take the capsule while being alone - though I usually don't do psychedelics on my own.

The guy who sold me the capsule hadn't tried it himself, and didn't know very much about it. Except it shouldn't be too long-lasting, and that the dose would probably be a bit on the weak side for people experienced with psychedelics.

T-0:00 : About 7 pm I ingested the capsule. Doing a bit of writing on the computer, while listening to some nice music.

T-0:25 : I feel a first alert. Definate tryptamine-energy creeping up my spine. Maybe a slight bit of nausea. I decide to quit the computer, and just lay on my bed to see where this is taking me.

T-0:35 : This stuff sure kicks in quick. I check in the mirror, and my pupils are moderately dilated. The music sure sounds nice, but no visual effects whatsoever.
/n

T-0:40 : It's getting impossible for me to relax at all. I feel extremely stimulated, but don't really want to leave my small dorm room. I'm sure it's very obvious I'm tripping at this point, and people are a bit up tight about that around here. I decide to try to learn myself how to juggle, with different things laying around the room. My mind is racing a bit, but not in a distinct psychedelic kind of way. I change music a lot. I never learn how to juggle, though I try for a long time. Having fun, though.

T-2:30 : Can it be that the effects are already subsiding? I had hoped for a longer experience. No visuals manifested at any time during the trip.
/n
/n
T-4:30 : Just a slight bit of effect left. I go to the dorm kitchen and drink a couple of beers with some friends. I get a good night's sleep after a couple of hours.

This compound reminded me definitely most about 5-MeO-DIPT. Same kind of restless tryptamine push, and nothing too deeply psychedelic. However, I had the feeling that larger doses of this substance might be much more worthwhile than large doses of 5-MeO-DIPT. The stimulated feeling was more comfortable and not quite as pushy.</bodytext></report>
