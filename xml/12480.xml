Dream Psilocybian 
/n
===================
/n
/n
What man can fathom the dreamy angles psilocybian 
/n
That arise from the earth in sickly-sweet parade
/n
To make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded? 
/n
/n
Electric is the parade of cascading absurdity 
/n
That claws at the soul with talons of flame
/n
And turns things once cherished and familiar 
/n
Into gargantuan monoliths of alienation and paranoia 
/n
For beyond the wall of dreams lie dismal fields eternal, and a sun that never rises
/n
/n
Through the silent desperation of twilight skies 
/n
Frost bitten by undying winds and darkness eternal
/n
And shrouded with the depraved laughter of a million madmen
/n
Lurks the dream psilocybian
/n
To make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded</bodytext></report>
