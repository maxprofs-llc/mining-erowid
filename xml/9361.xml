I have enjoyed LSD and psilocybin, so when a friend suggested I try HBW I was looking forward optimistically to a peaceful, colorful, entertaining six hours or so -- a nice walk in the woods followed by a concert.  We peeled/sanded 3 seeds and each ate 1.5.  She had the experience we both expected.  My crippling nausea lasted 12 hours.  If she hadn't been in good shape and ready to care for me, it would have been even more painful, plus very messy (she brought me many cups of warm water and helped me puke).

Psychically it was not too overwhelming (for a non-novice) -- it just sucked out loud.  For a total of about ten seconds, I was afraid I was going to die, which balanced the ten seconds (early on) that I actually felt almost good.  I withdrew completely from the world because I felt best if I concentrated on my breathing, which seemed to me to have a bad habit of stopping for short periods whenever I didn't pay attention.  Only in darkness and silence was I able to ward off panic.  My hands became numb and I felt cold, with horribly stiff neck and shoulders, but my pulse was slow and regular throughout.  I felt rather stupid for poisoning myself voluntarily for fun, and swore Hallmark-card oaths to appreciate the beauty of daily life and the sub-toxic cheering effects of the local wine (Trollinger -- mmm mmm good!).

My salvation was that I was eventually able to sleep.  When I read that people routinely take 6 or 10 of these things, my mind was blown.</bodytext></report>
