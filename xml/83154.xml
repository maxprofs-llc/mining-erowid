The day to end all days it seemed. An experience I was NOT prepared for. Having little money at the time I bought this cheap Flatliner thinking that the media hype surrounding its potential to kill was just well, hype. I WAS WRONG.

It happened; my world became another planet. I was 2 people talking to each other. I was a cartoon character. I was on another planet. I was screaming inside my head but couldn't talk properly. I ran desperately around to try and get the experience to end, my mind was ruined. I knew I had gone too far taking this drug. I was seasoned with amphetamines and psychedelics even ketamine I can handle, but this was beyond recognition, beyond comprehension. The world became a place that was filled with good people, but I was most certainly not one of them. I was an alien in a human disguise. What if the fellow people knew? If they didn't know they would most certainly find out. I could hear voices telling me I was going to die and that I should probably end it all. I was sweating like a PIG. I felt like I couldn't breathe, everyone else was breathing air. But air wasn't right for me, i needed another gas. God I felt lost. God was telling me I was.

Then the nausea, I was sick off this drug. Constant vomiting and dry heaving. My body felt ruined. I can't put a timeframe on this, time had melted away a long time ago as far as I was concerned. But slowly I remembered who I was and left for home on the bus. When Planet Earth beckoned I started to feel a mild amphetamine effect. Speedy and relieved that the whole experience was over. I still count my blessings to this day I didn't die from this.

In my opinion this is not a drug to be messed with. Its negative effects seem to outweigh any positive attributes. However if you like to lose you sanity then go ahead. I doubt very much that labs produce this drug anymore.
