Oh my god, I've never felt so sick in my life.  I was sitting at my computer and I looked at my chocolate chip and saw that it was completely full.  Sitting next to it was my chocolate easter bunny that I had never unwrapped.  A strange craving grew within my soul and I decided to eat.

45 minutes later:  I had eaten all the chocolate and was feeling quite sick.

1 hour later:  I threw up.  And my pulse is kinda faster.  Oh yeah, and I feel really sick still.

4 hours later:  I took some valium and tried to get to sleep.  No luck.  My stomach feels really sludgy or something.  I can't explain it.  I feel like shit.

6 hours later:  The valium seems to be working..I feel really relaxed..I'm going to go to sleep now.

This was transcribed off of my Trip log (a yellow notebook).  My guess is that the best way to get the caffeine/theobromine high isn't through eating 5 lbs. of chocolate.  Nothing actually even happened to me besides the extreme body load of eating five pounds of chocolate.  (i.e. diarrhea, vomiting, cramps, pain.)  On the bright side of this experience, I don't think I'll be craving chocolate for a while.

P.s. I do have this strange feeling at the bridge of my nose that I get whenever I roll.  It's like my consciousness or my soul has shifted closer to the front of my face..Like I'm thinking out of that part of my brain.  Really strange sensation.
