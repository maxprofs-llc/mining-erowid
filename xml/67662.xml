I got to a well-known college, usually regarded as a 'hippy school'. Well, here I found many others much like myself, who were interested in enlightenment through entheogens. A friend and I decided to vision quest on Saturday, seeking the Sun Gods. I prepared by fasting from 6:00 PM the day before till the time of consumption. My partner did not.

0:00 - It's noon and we each consume about 250 seeds orally. My friend weighs much less, but insists on eating 250 because he is experienced with LSD and psychedelic mushrooms.

+1:00 - Both begin to feel effects. Slight color enhancement, better mood, dreamy atmoshpere. Both begin to feel sick.

+1:30 - We're both in the bathroom of our dorm because we feel sick. We are each sitting in a stall. I'm staring at the tiles, noticing the patterns of square changing colors and sizes. I mention this to my friend and he goes into a similar state. I eventually enter a transe-like state in which I see image of home and memories. I forget I am in the bathroom, wake, and fall of the toilet. We decide we should go lie down in our rooms, and part ways.

+2:00 - My room is extremely intense and my bed is welcoming. I don't want to look around, but my blanket comforts me. I text message my friend and we converse through text messaging because do not have the energy to speak to each other out loud. We eventually both decide to go outside onto the quad. We get our IPODs and go lay out with some people. At this time, my friend had puked violently three or four times. I can't stop staring at the amazing visuals in the sky. I look for the sun gods as I listen to 'Waiting for the Sun'. Something about the sun assures me I'll be fine, but it's also beating down on me hard.

+4:00 - A friend calls and wants to meet up. She meets me in the quad and we decide to go to get food. I have no energy to moon and need to make a ton of stops on the way. When I get to the dining hall, I can't eat. I barely put down some bread and a glass of water. I feel like I am going to die.
/n
/n
+5:00 - I'm taken back to my room and my friends stay for a while. I try to eat a brownie and get the whole thing down. I tell them I'll be fine and they leave. I lie back, feeling as though I was dieing, and decide to give in to the sun gods. I fall asleep.

+8:00 - I wake up, which is surprising to me. I thought I would certainly be dead. I feel groggy but walk fine, unlike before. The psychedelic effects have passed and I feel like the gods have left me. The rest of the night goes by fine.
/n
/n
+10:00 - I see my friend. Apparently, he had went to his friend's room after he came down, and hit a vaporizer. He had a near-death experience on his way back to our dorm, and was scared for his life. He couldn't explain it well.

I feel like the sun gods wanted to teach us something about accepting death as a part of rebirth. Non just physical death, but small deaths that lead to inner development. I'm grateful for this quest despite the severe weakness I felt. The weakness definitely humbled me, and I'm sure that was part of the master plan of the spirits.</bodytext></report>
