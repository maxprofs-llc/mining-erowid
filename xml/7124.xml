Trip report: 20mg 5meoDIPT, oral dose, ~10mg 
/n
insufflated.  Subject, male, 21, 160lbs, lots 
/n
of psychedelic experience.
/n
/n
Hello!  I'm a brave chemical researcher, always
/n
trying to push the envelope for the good of everyone.
/n
Eh heh.  Actually, what I did last night resulted in
/n
a great trip, but the route which I took was quite 
/n
reckless!  Don't mess around with research chemicals 
/n
unless you have a scale that can measure the usually
/n
very small doses which you need.  A friend of mine, a
/n
very magic lady, lent me some 5-MeO-DiPT
/n
and I decided it was a must-try!
/n
/n
At 10pm I took what I had eyeballed to be a twenty
/n
milligram dose of 5-MeO-DiPT, in a gelcap.  The amount of
/n
powder needed was very miniscule, and I must take this
/n
opportunity again to warn that these small amounts
/n
really should be weighed precisely.  At about midnight,
/n
I shook out a small amount of powder and divided it into
/n
what I 'thought' 5mg looked like.  I got two very small
/n
lines, those of you into regularly snorting things would
/n
not be satisfied with the size of these lines, but this
/n
was no narcotic, this was a potent psychedelic!  The 
/n
powder didn't burn much at all, and the small amount
/n
of chemical taste in my drip was more than tolerable.
/n
I had noticed effects begin to start a mere half hour
/n
after dosing.  I had fasted the entire day except for
/n
one or two light snacks, so I attribute the rapid onset
/n
to this.  There was little nausea, just barely 
/n
perceptable, but this soon faded as the trip began.
/n
I determined to boost my effects and thus insufflated 
/n
the small lines two hours after dosing.  Normally if
/n
you redose on this chemical, the literature says you
/n
have to take more, but I think that up the nose results
/n
in a faster onset and better bioavailibility.  
/n
/n
At 12:30 the effects fully came on, with first a set of
/n
low-hued visual distortions, followed by bright, 
/n
colorful tryptamine hallucinations, very like what
/n
one would see on the traditional trips, acid, shrooms,
/n
morning glory, but much cleaner and more intense.  The
/n
colors were really something, it was a continually
/n
 shifting spectrum, the whole of my range of site
/n
cycling the colors in response to some rhythem I could
/n
not comprehend.  During this come up and plateau of 
/n
the drug, I felt a few mind effects of tripping,
/n
but overall I was very much in control at all times.
/n
/n
I am pretty experienced with psychedelics, and moreso
/n
with with the OTC favorite DXM, so this may have 
/n
something to do with the amount of control I maintained.
/n
The visual distortions were really something else, fully
/n
3-D bumps and ridges appearing out of no where, objects
/n
swinging and flexing, etc.  At one point I stared
/n
intently at my beige carpet, and was amazed to see it 
/n
turn into flowing sand dunes!  
/n
/n
At about 3am I noticed a definent decrease in the
/n
effects of the 5-MeO-DiPT.  At about this time I started
/n
to smoke a lot of weed, and also began to feel the
/n
body load come on.  I got a few cramps up in my abdomen,
/n
like near my belly button for some reason.  That was 
/n
the worst of it, other than a general achey feeling all
/n
over, cleared up easily by ibuprofen. 
/n
/n
At this point, I actually started eating food!  The bong
/n
had made me hungry, so I made several trips to the 
/n
kitchen.  Because I think vitamin C always helps trips
/n
along, I grabbed and orange and a slice of bread and 
/n
devoured both in no time flat.  Then I went back and
/n
got a pear, and then a banana; luckily we eat a lot of
/n
fruit in my family!  I think my body preferred this
/n
healthy snack over anything else I could have eaten, 
/n
although maybe the majority of fruit contributed
/n
something to my cramp, who knows.  
/n
/n
At 5:15am I was still tripping a little bit and getting 
/n
mild visuals, so I decided to turn in, figuring I was
/n
sleepy enough from being awake so long that I wouldn't
/n
need a sedative.  I expected tryptamine insomnia tho,
/n
and got my share of it.  The hallucinations with only
/n
night lumination coming through my shaded windows were
/n
very cool, with my shadows 'freezing' in my line of
/n
sight.  I tossed and turned a lot, mostly to try to
/n
appease my cramped abdomen.  However by about 7am I
/n
fell asleep, and woke up at 11:30am with the aid of
/n
my alarm clock.
/n
/n
It's now almost two the day after,
/n
and I still feel kind of muffle-headed and dizzy. 
/n
Luckily I don't think that I really overdosed on this 
/n
substance, and if I did, the OD wasn't harsh or totally
/n
bad.  Since I weighed out my doses just by eyeballing,
/n
a very risky way to do things, there's no way really to
/n
say how much I took, although in my research I see
/n
that the average dose is at the high end 20mg, and
/n
at the insane end 40mg+.  This was a very enjoyable
/n
trip, and I've never had visuals this good!  This was my
/n
first real experience with a research chemical, and I
/n
must say that I'm really impressed.  My hat goes off
/n
to our country's chemists, always preparing new and 
/n
exciting (and legal!) substances for the exploration
/n
of conciousness.  I'd like to throw in my voice and
/n
say that 5-MeO-DiPT is very enjoyable, and I'd like to see
/n
more work done on this and other chemicals so that they
/n
are more mainstream and safe and no longer need to be
/n
'reasearched.'</bodytext></report>
