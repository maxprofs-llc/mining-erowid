I found Adrafinil whilst researching stimulants. I do a lot of driving for my work and sometimes on a Friday evening I can nod off in the car due to extreme tiredness.

I got Adrafinil from a website and tried it the next time I noticed I was dropping off at the wheel. The amazing thing is that normally when I am that tired, very little, including winding the window down, playing loud music etc, works. Caffeine doesn't even work when I am that tired. 1 tablet of Adrafinil and 20 minutes later its as if all feelings of tiredness had completely gone. It was as if I had woken up from a long sleep fully refreshed.

I could get to sleep 3 or four hours later, although I did notice that my sleep is not as deep as normal. I also noticed that the tablet works for approximately 18-20 hours before wearing off.</bodytext></report>
