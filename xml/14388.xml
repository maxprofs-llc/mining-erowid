I signed up for a medical study to make some quick cash.
/n
$50 and they injected me with Scopolamine HCl and made me do memory tests for 2 hours.
/n
/n
Some notable effects:
/n
absolutely no euphoria
/n
confusion
/n
dissociation (feelings of unreality)
/n
incredibly dry mouth that water does not help
/n
inability to walk straight
/n
severly disrupted short term memory
/n
/n
Overall the effects were unpleasant and a nuisance, perhaps more unpleasant b/c of the doctors staring at me taking notes making me feel rather uncomfortable.
/n
/n
Took about 5 hours for the effects to wear off, but I was walking into shit for maybe another 5 hours after the mental effects were gone.
/n
/n
No fun.</bodytext></report>
