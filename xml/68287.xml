This DIDNT WORK for my girlfriend, but works for me.

I used to take bupropion alone for my depression, however, I started having issues with depression even on meds.  No meds the doctors could find could make me not depressed.

Every single day since I have started doing this (and I have been doing it a while now) has been-only able to be described as perfect.  I don't catch a buzz, I don't get dizzy or drunk feeling, so if that is what you are looking for, don't try this.  The only thing I get is a constant state of pleasure at all times.  Sometimes i get headaches, but I have always had those.

Everything is enjoyable, music brings constant euphoria, dancing is so fun, its easy to be nice, I can smile and laugh more, and depression is not even an option.  I take a 24hr break every 5 days from the dxm to make sure my system is ok.

How I do it:
/n
/n
7:00am Bupropion SR 150
/n
7:30am GABA 2 scoops in 1 cup apple juice
/n
3:00pm Bupropion SR 150 + GABA 2 scoops in 1 cup apple juice + 60mg extended release DXM (in the form of mucinex DM)
/n
9:00pm Bupropion SR 150 + GABA 2 scoops in 1 cup apple juice
/n
/n
(random nicotine during the day as well, unknown if affecting.  Amount 1-3 cigarettes dispersed throughout the day)
/n

Also make sure to drink alot of water as this will keep things working.  I drink water bottles all day long...probably 60-80oz daily.

Remember, this may not work for you, or may have negative side affects for some individuals.  It made my girlfriend nauseous-to the point of being stuck in bed all day- while on the other hand, it has and continues to make my life wonderful to the point of extacy all day long-with no hangover effect.  When I do take a break, i still feel good, and it just slowly settles back to 'normal'.

Good luck, and hope you all find this works for you...</bodytext></report>
