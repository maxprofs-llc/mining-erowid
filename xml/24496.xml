I could write a twenty page report and still not explain in detail my experiences with the 'dream macine' so I will be as brief as possible. First I must explain myself a little bit. I have had a life long struggle with drug abuse. It isn't all fun and games. But at this point in my life, at age 37, I have come to some control with my drug use, and take a fairly scientific approach.

The 'dream machine' is a device I built out of an old record player, posterboard, and a bright light. I won't go in to detail about it other than it was invented by Brion Gyson, and there are many sights concerning this.

These experiments were conducted over a period of time and my drug use for the most part was a variable. I take celaxa and lorazapam as maitainence drugs to manage obsessive compulive disorder, and panic atacks. I don't feel the side effects influenced the outcome.

The 'dream macine' is supposed to stimulate alpha waves, but I think it might only be retinal stimulation. What I do is close my eyes in front of a bright light that flashes intermittently, and it creates patterns, that start fuzzy, then become clearer the longer you sit there. A strobe light set to seven to thirteen flashes per second would probably work.

During my years of bad drug use I found that hallucinogenic drugs opened my mind to possibilities and didn't just fuck me up. Because of my mental health, I didn't think it would be wise to use them when I felt I wanted to explore my mind further. So I tried this device with milder drugs to see if it would give me similar mind expansion.

The device did just this, but I was a little surprised at the results.

The best combination of drugs was caffeine and hydrocodone based cough syrup. The images were fuzzy at first, then geometric images with flashes of images similar to hallucinations. Like images of naked women, a breast with a nipple that morphed into an eye. I see a lot of eyes and the state this device puts me in is dreamy and very relaxed.

I smoke cannibus regularly, aproximately one standard bong hit nightly. Coupled with the hydrocodone my results were also good. I must mention that different music would create better or weaker images and mind expansion. Specifically, Radiohead's Karma Police worked by far the best.

Anyway, weed and junk produced my best hallucination. It started with a small crucifix that opened up to an upside down star, and some demonic beast was staring out, it then furthur morphed into a five pointed star with a man inside legs and arms spread out to the points.

I was surprised that seraquil was probably the worst. This drug is an antipsychotic used for schizophrenia. It produces a cannabis type high mixed with a mild mescaline buzz. I smoked one hit of weed with it. The images seemed to become clear faster, but they were completely abstract, and I was too tired to give a shit. I just laid down and listened to music, and images came on their own.</bodytext></report>
