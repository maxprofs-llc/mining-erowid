I found a nice little way of producing low grade opium like tar from californian poppies
/n
/n
note: P used a stainless steel pan but i'm sure you could use pyrex or something.
/n
/n
1) bring 1 cup water to a boil
/n
2) put 2.5 tablespoons poppy seeds in a mortar and pestal and grind it up a bunch (add some of the boiling water if it doesnt grind well)
/n
3) add the poppy junk to the pan
/n
4) simmer on medium for about 10 - 15 minutes
/n
5) strain through a mesh strainer then through a coffee filter
/n
6) throw away the seeds and clean the pan
/n
7) put the nasty brew back in the pan
/n
8) evaporate the water off by simmering it till it starts to get nasty and starts to stick to the sides
/n
9) when that happens put it at an angle so the juice collects in a puddle (if your using a gas stove and a pan with a handle you can just prop it up)
/n
10) at this point it should be waaaay less that what you started with and you should start to see a orange tar form (could be a different color too) and should smell like burnt sugar sorta
/n
11) scrap that up and keep it, I recommend kneading it a bit with a spoon to push out the remaining water
/n

Put that in your pipe and smoke it. It makes me feel nice and warm and floaty =D</bodytext></report>
