I was prescribed Dilantin, or Phenytoin, as it is classified on the bottle, a short time after I had started suffering seizures from abusing Xanax. I seldom use it, but I do experiment with it from time to time...truth be told, I never felt much more intelligent or aware or focused while on the drug, unless I was clean from the Xanax for two weeks, and injested more than the clinicly prescribed dosage (100-300 mgs).

The 'Intelligence' I felt was very erratic, as though, I did not know what I wanted to do...the focus was definitely there, but I my attention span was decreased exponentially. I'd start a project and leave it unfinished.</bodytext></report>
