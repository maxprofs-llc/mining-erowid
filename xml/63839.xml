So it was given to me by a friend, there were for of us, we split one 40mg Opana ER into 4 pieces, we railed a quarter pill each. I threw up something terrible after about 40 minutes, but the feeling is as close to heroin as I get.  I get morphine trips, they're fun.  It was incredibly powerful, so much more powerful than any opiate I've ever tried, I havent tried heroin, but I reckon this is as close as I get.  The feeling of amazingness was overwhelming.  Complete bliss. It is the most amazing sense of relaxation I've ever had, pure bliss.</bodytext></report>
