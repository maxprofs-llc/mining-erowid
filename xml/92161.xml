First, a brief history to give you an idea of what led me to 2c-c. Like many people, my college days were a time of experimentation with various substances, among them the usual marijuana, LSD and mushrooms. But after a couple of bad experiences with the psychedelics I swore them off and eventually even decided that I was getting too many negative side effects from pot, and quit that as well.

In my late 20s I was introduced to MDMA, and became a huge fan. I wasn't an every day, or even every week user, but I did occasionally indulge more than once a month, until eventually the magic began to wear off and I was forced to curtail my use of this wonderful substance as well.

In my 30s I settled down, more or less quit my partying ways and got married--even had a daughter, who I love dearly.I drink wine almost every evening to relax, but other substances seemed to be a thing of the past. However, I've always been fascinated by mind-altering chemicals.In the past I had loved everything I had tried, but as I have mentioned they eventually all lost their magic. But one realization I had a couple of years ago was that the magic loss of the substances was probably due as much to my ongoing struggles with depression as it was the chemicals themselves. I was self-medicating, and not very effectively. But after finding an anti-depressant that really seems to help my mood on a day-to-day basis (Cymbalta), I decided it might be time to re-enter the world of 'recreational' drugs, especially psychedelics, to see what they might be able to teach me. This time around, I am particularly more interested in the therapeutic and revelatory nature of the chemicals, as opposed to just using them for a 'high' as I did in my partying days.

After some research on 'legal' chemicals, I found an online vendor who claimed to supply 2c-c. I read up for weeks on the substance, and it seemed like an easy re-entry to the world of psychedelics. So I decided to give it a go and placed an order. A week or so later I received 250mg of a fluffy white powder.

I had no interest in diving right in, for fear of the chemical being something other than described. So I worked my way up incrementally to make sure I had no allergic reactions, or that it wasn't mislabeled bromo-dragonfly or some such thing. After trying 1mg and 5mg doses with no negative effects, I began trials at 25mg (I made sure to buy a mg scale so that I could know just how much I was dosing).

I mix my 2c-c with water, orange juice, or ginger ale. In a regular-sized glass of liquid, it has no noticeable taste at all. For me, I usually start noticing the effects about an hour in, when my body temperature will spike a little bit. That usually settles down, and after an hour and a half or so I get a little giddy, like I'm in an extra good mood. Playing with my daughter before her bedtime becomes especially enjoyable, and I will notice slight visual distortions, but nothing I can ever quite put my finger on.

After about two hours or so the effects really kick in.  One thing about this substance is that it makes me incredibly horny, and my tactile senses go into overdrive.  Things feel very comfortable, although sometimes my skin feels slightly 'sticky'.  On slightly higher doses (say, 30mg) I will have hallucinations where things start to warp a little bit in my periphery, but if I try to focus on them they usually disappear. The bathroom becomes surreal, and I have to remind myself not to trust my reflection. However, my mental space always remains amazingly lucid--I can converse with family and friends with no difficulty, and without them knowing I am tripping. However, things that are funny are even more so--but not in a fake way like with pot. More like things I would have laughed at anyway I laugh harder at.

But the best part of the trip is always the additional closeness I feel with my wife.  Again, it doesn't feel 'false'. It's like the things that I always feel but sometimes hang out in the background, come right to the fore, slightly amplified. It makes for wonderful, close sex and a magnificent afterglow.  I sometimes have trouble falling to sleep, but I'm always comfortable and happy to chill in bed until sleep finally arrives. The experience overall is so pleasant, I initially tried dosing more than one day in a row--but there seems to be a rapid tolerance, and it takes a week or so to be able to trip again at a similar dose.  Comedown is usually easy and I have no hangovers.

All in all I'd give this substance four stars for helping me become closer with my wife, connect more with my friends, and just generally make the world a more interesting place while I'm on it. HOWEVER. I have started to notice that a day or two after dosing, I will be in a particularly foul or depressed mood. This morning I was so angry with my wife I could barely speak with her, and it was over the smallest most trivial details. Thankfully I have the presence of mind to suspect that my mood is chemical, and so I have thusfar been able to maintain my composure. But if this negative after-effect of the 2c-c proves to be consistent, I may have to discontinue use. I'd be curious to hear if anyone else has had a similar reaction, or if perhaps this is partially due to the Cymbalta. But thanks to US drug policy, it's probably unlikely we'll ever know the answers to these questions.</bodytext></report>
