I boiled some water, and poured in a homemade mixture of Valerian root, Scullcap, Hops, a small amount of Peppermint leaves for taste, and small amount of chamomile, rosehips, and lemon rind.

I poured in some honey to taste.  After drinking the mixture, I began to feel very at peace, and very happy - an overall sense of well being.  There were minor visuals, i.e. seeing lights out of the corner of the eye, auras around certain objects, etc.  A few minutes later, I had the ability to lose awareness of everything around me, except what I was doing - no distractions whatsoever, be they mental or physical.  Although my ability to concentrate and think clearly was impaired, I found that I could completely engulf myself in a book of pictures, or in a magazine, and not be distracted by anything at all.

I wouldn't say that this was a 'buzz' or that I was 'stoned' at all, but it was a pleasing experience, and I may try it more often as a means to relax before bed after a hard day.</bodytext></report>
