I was looking for a reliable source of downers to come down from coke on.  While searching, i found an online pharmacy that doesn't sell REALLY good stuff (like Oxy), but it does carry Codeine Phosphate ... WITHOUT Acetaminophen ... less than $1 a pill.  Whee! I don't have to process it.

It gives me a nice mellow buzz, no paranoia like weed does, no loss of motor control like alcohol.  The first time was a work night, so I only took one 50-mg pill, since I wasn't sure how it would affect me.  It took about 30 minutes to hit, and it was light - kind of like how (legal) Demoral made me feel after surgery ... a little relaxed and happy, and very slightly buzzed.

Have to take more to get a real trip going, but only do that on weekends, 'cause you'll lose all motivation to accomplish anything.  Still, it's a great buzz, and since I don't have to bother trying to extract the Acetaminophen, I'm going to keep trippin.</bodytext></report>
