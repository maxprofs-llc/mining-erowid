One night, 3 hour span, 30 mg of 5-meo-dipt crystals insulfated in 10mg lines over an hour and a half, then 15mg 5-meo-dalt insulfated, followed by 375ml of 40%XO e &amp; j brandy, 4 grams of cannabis, .25 gram of full melt bubble hashish..., Very warm tactile feelings, overall mood lift + euphoria, if I focus my eyes I get honeycomb red and green visuals in a otherwise single candle lit room....an hour in 24 oz. of strong kratom tea washes down 25mg of meclizine hcl,  12mg of melatonin , 100mg 5-htp, + velvet bean extract 250mg
