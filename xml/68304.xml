Just to lead this off, I am a chemist at a Pharma Lab, although this took place while I was in college for biochemistry, to add some validity to my story. I took 2-CT-7 three times in 2001 while it was still legal to buy through a chemical company.It was kind of disturbing to see in the Rolling Stone article about the kids who died used the same order form the guy who got our sample used. At the time I had no microbalance and the doses weren't described as clear cut as they are today. So I personally took the whole sample, 400mg, and cut it into half like a line of coke to 200mg, and again to 100mg, and so on, which again is crazy to think we didn't OD but also leads to an unknown exact dose per hit.

The first experience, a friend and I after doing a little research took an approx. 40mg dose measured as described above, pressed into bread and taken into a pill. After going to bed after an hour thinking we'd gotten a bad batch, another half an hour later we both woke up simultaneously and met each other in the hall walking towards each other having had it hit at the same time almost two hours after ingestion. A great trip similar to mushrooms and X and with no nausea, actual hallucinations for me while my friend experienced something more akin to LSD with the melting and such, while I experienced something a little more coherent in surroundings but with complete full length hallucinations, no muddling of visuals, of people being in the room, and animal kingdom on my microwave, etc. What I would imagine schizophrenia is like since its not 'trippy' so much as its indistinguishable from reality. Lasted approximately 6 hours.

Second experience was approx. 40 mg snorted. Exact opposite of the ingestion in that it included me vomiting violently twice twenty minutes in, probably din't help that we were in a car middle of the day, with a sober driver I might add. After that scare, again great hallucinations of people on the hood of the car, and the incessant need to listen to the song 'Tiny Cities Made of Ashes' about thirty times in a row and the drinking of a case of coca cola at our destination. Spent most of the time under a blanket in the back seat since the movement was too intense to visualize, only getting out to pick up a friend half way who had no idea of our condition, poor thing, I'm still not sure if she knows what was wrong with us. A nice little field trip out of the car though, no paranoia. Again lasting about 4 to 6 hours.

My friend also had nausea but was able to keep it together, same friend as first trip, who also has diabetes as I see there was a question whether that could be a problem earlier. A cross again of mushrooms and X but without the sometimes annoying self examination that you get at the end of some trips when the visuals end but the high is still going much to your malign and you can't shut down your mind.

Third time was approx. 20mg snorted with a first timer. He went off on his own and had a modderate trip out of what I could gather from what he said. He left on his own around the peak time but is a common over exaggerator when it comes to these things. I had almost no effects, possibly because this all took place in the same week and a half, no nausea, just a good body high, and everything after that is skewed because we started smoking pot since I had apparently become immune and needed something to entertain myself since all my receptors for this drug must have been filled.

Overall a very positive experience although after learning the difference between a great trip, no trip and death is only a few milligrams I wouldn't do without a reliable scale and a sober partner. But back then I was young and stupid.</bodytext></report>
