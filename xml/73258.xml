I got 240 Marinol to experiment.  First off let me mention that these pills are very costly.  I think it came to around 25 dollars a pill.  Insurance covered it.  Marinol 10 mg orange tablets.  They are stored in the refridge.  It contains dronabinol in a sesame seed oil base.

So here's how it went.  The first time I tried them I took one and hours went by with no noticable effects.  So the next day I took two and again no effect that I could notice.  The third day I took 3 figuring I would notice it, but still not really something I could say much about.  So the next day it was 5 and at this point I figured it was really weak.  So the next day at night I decided to on a whim take ten.  You have to understand that I didn't notice barely anything at five so I figured what the hell.  I ate ten and about and hour later retired to bed.

Maybe two hours after I ate them and about an hour of sleeping I woke up with a very peculiar feeling.  I was laughing as if I was being tickled.  It was by no means pleasant and I had a feeling of high altitude and light headedness.  It was not like eating herb.  It was really not fun.  I almost went to the ER but got some charcoal in me and it mellowed after a few hours.  Marinol is a sad replacment for pot.</bodytext></report>
