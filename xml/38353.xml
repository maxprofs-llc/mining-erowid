T+ 0 minutes: Aquired 1 gram of MBDB divided into 4 individual segments approximately 250mg each. With one 250mg portion I insufflated a line composed of around 50mg of compound. Found the compound bodily friendly to the extent there was minimal nasal burn.

T+ 30 minutes: Yet to be developing a high of such, decided to ingest the other 200mg. Taste is similar to other phenethylamines, not disagreeable at all.

T+ 1 hour: I am beginning to feel the effects of the compound, feels good to do nothing, lay back and close the eyes. I am developing a sense of self-worth and compassion for my friends sitting near by. We are chatting on issues close to the heart and it feels good to discuss these things openly. There is a definite clarity that presents its self from my inner regions.

T+ 1:30 Very calmative and sedating, I find myself thinking to myself quite often but with no real conclusion to anything. Sitting comfortably in my lounge chair, I continue to smile without realising I am, eyes still closed I continually morph into a trance like sedation. I like this chemical completely!</bodytext></report>
