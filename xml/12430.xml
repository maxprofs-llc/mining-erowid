Second time trying to achieve perceptual effects from LSA in morning glory seeds. Both times, using Heavenly Blues(uncoated, thank goodness).

The night before this attempt, my friend and I ground about 150 seeds, maybe as many as 200, in a coffee grinder, and poured lemon juice over the grey-and-black powder. Made sure to shake it up every once in a while. About 24 hours later (the next evening), it was a soupy mess. Filtered it with a reusable coffee filter, it's a cone of extremely fine wire mesh, leaving the black parts, the nausea-causing seed coats in the cone. The good stuff, the gooey part, the seed embryos dissolved in lemon juice, was collected in a big mug. Mixed this with bottled water (we had heard that chlorine in city water would destroy the amides) and stirred it up. No bad taste at all. Just like lemonade, without sugar. Not difficult to drink in the least. Took it slowly, drank it all between 10:05 PM and 10:15 PM.

We chilled and played video games for a while (my friend, at whose apartment we were doing all this, was planning on taking some seeds, but not till later that night) and I felt a little excitement, but for the first hour or so, that was it. After that hour (about 11:15), I started feeling some very very mild effects of intoxication. A little bit giggly, eyes don't focus quite so well, etc. Just what it feels like after having one good stiff drink.

After about two hours, got a little bit of nausea. Very mild. A shot of imetrol and it was gone. Nothing compared to the sickness I had gotten the first time, after eating whole seeds.

I went home and went to bed about 3:30AM. I was walking home in the dark, under the street lights. Maybe it was just placebo effects, maybe it was lack of sleep, but colors did seems a little brighter and when I looked at one spot in the grass in front of where I was walking, it was slightly distorted. Round ripples.

All in all, 150-200 seeds *should*, I thought, have been significantly more effective, for someone who does not do any other drugs regularly, and has only even tried one or two drugs ever.
