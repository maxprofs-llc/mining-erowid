I'll keep it short and informative, I had bought 2 pills of white pisces x and was ready to trip with a newbie friend of mine. She descided to wait till a later time to try it so I took both pills. I had also taken 1 pill from gnc of st. Johns wort extract about 30 min before I took the x. I had no idea that those were mild maoi's.

30 min after I took the x I started feeling the effects and also invited the most painful headace I've ever had at the same time. About 2 minutes after I started to feel the painful headache my right hand started to twitch violently and uncontrollably. Before I could get the sentence out 'I think I'm having a seizu.....' I was convulsing in the chair with my eyes rolled back and body shaking violently. The girls couldnt keep me from falling out of my chair and I hit my face on the concrete floor. I woke from the seizure not remembering what had happened or who I was with. The next day I went to the hospital and they told me it was directly because of the high dose and mixture of drugs that sent me into a hypertensive crises. That's the last time I do that shit. I'm better off staying with my love mary jane.</bodytext></report>
