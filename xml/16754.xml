Made tea from 7 1.5' catnip flowers, 1 Tsp ful of ground ginger,
/n
1 Tsp fresh clover honey.  Here is the report.
/n
/n
T+ 5 min: Tastes like real strong mint tea.  I like it.
/n
/n
T+ 12: Smoke 1 cig (aprox 1 gm) catnip flower, tastes a lot like the tea, quite minty and tasty! Aprox 1/2 done with Joint, I feel more relaxed.  Could this really be working??!!
/n
/n
T+ 20: About 1/2 tea left, heavy menthol flavor.  Not at all trippy, but certainly slows mental processes.  I did smoke aprox 2 gm of Beasters (commercial, Cansdian hydro buds) throughout the day, unsure if this is like a rebuzz, or something wholly different.
/n
/n
T+ 40: Still not baseline, Try More tea, only stronger.
/n
/n
T+ 1.10: Just finished second cup of tea, no ginger this time.  Again I used the same amount of catnip, but I boiled it instead of steeping it, to the same effect.  Time seems to go a bit faster, whilst remaining very relaxed.  The real strong flavor in the first cup was the ginger, which had seemingly no effect other than flavor.
/n
/n
T+ 2.20: Smoke 3 more hits of Beasters, reach expected high.  About to smoke another J of catnip (deseeded this time).  Joint adds another dimension to my stone.  Taste of catnip is much more pallatable w/o seeds!
/n
/n
Overall, there is a nice but very mild sedative/depressant effect to catnip.</bodytext></report>
