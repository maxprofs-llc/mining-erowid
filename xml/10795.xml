Last Weekend I was stuck at some relatives' house with no pot, no DXM, no nothing.  I was bored and decided to try something really easy to get.  I rumaged through the house and found some Scotch Guard Fabric Protector in a red plaid looking can.  The back said deliberate inhalation is harmful.  So of course I tried it.  I sprayed some onto a rag and I put it up to my nose.  I huffed in a lungful very slowly, as it was very sharp in my nose.  I repeated this about 4 times and then I put the rag down.  I then had an experience very close to a Nitrous Oxide buzz.  I heard a helicopter and I saw like only 5 frames a minute.  I kept looking at my hands and wondering why they were hands.  Their was mild euphoria.  It ended in about 30 seconds.  After that I laid down and went to sleep.

Then I woke up the nezt morning and did it again.  Then an hour later I did it again.  Then in 30 minutes.  Then in 10.  Then again.  Then again.  It got to where I was just sitting with the rag, spraying on the spray and huffing, then repeat.  It was scary.  I eventually had to cut myself off as I was getting scared of brain damage and the rapid addiction that had formed.  I went back home the next day and I haven't touched the stuff since.  I still feel a little slow and I am coughing quite often.  I am sure it caused irreversible brain damage.  This is the only inhalant besides nitrous I've done.  It is strange and not at all fun.  I've had a lot of experience with pot, and use DXM occasionally.  This was something completely new to me.</bodytext></report>
