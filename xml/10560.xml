Hi, I would just like to give a little warning about Gingko Biloba.
/n

I am an 18 year old swedish student that for some time has taken Gingko pills. (pure EGb 761) Two per day. And when I for two days forgot to eat them I became Extreamly tired. (!)

I didnt manage to get out of bed at all for a day, hardly able to lift my arms, feeling tired for several days following. I meen I could get out of bed but in the same way I probably can run five miles at top speed to if I tried...

I am now taking them again and feeling fine but I thought you should know the story.  I dont think its such a big deal and I dont know if this is a single case with just me but...  knowledge is knowledge.

Have a great time and care about your friends and fellow people.</bodytext></report>
