I recently bought several packages of Betel Nut chew off a website.  I have been looking forward to trying betel nut for months now, but now don't know what to think.  I received my order earlier today and opened up a package of the rose flavored chew and popped in my mouth.

After about 3 minutes, a lump developed in my throat as my chest began to tighten.  I quickly spat out what was in my mouth and rinsed my mouth out.  It's been around ten minutes since and my chest is starting to relax and the lump in my throat is almost gone.  I don't know if it was a reaction to the betel nut or some other ingredient in the chew, but it wasn't pleasant.  Maybe I am just super sensitive or allergic.</bodytext></report>
