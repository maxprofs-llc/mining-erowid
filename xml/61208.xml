I am 23 years old, and will pay for this mistake for longer than I would like to admit. The courts say two years, let this be a sign of things to come in this story. This story may not flow very well but my memory of the events that occurred doesnt flow right either. For the record I think I ate anywhere between 2 and 3 seed pods to myself in a 4 or 5 hour window.

It is July 20th, 2006 in Colorado. I was celebrating getting a new apartment. I had brought some friends up from Denver to party with me. Normally I tend to stick with marijuana as my recreational party item, but this day was different. My friend had said that she spotted some Jimson weed outside. I had asked what it was. She told me it was a psychedelic. Three of us had decided to have some. I had made some fried chicken and all the fixins and we ate some seeds.

We didn't feel anything after 45 min except for a body high. We all decided to eat a little more. We all figured that 45 minutes was enough to digest and process the seeds, man were we wrong.

Things get fuzzy at 2 hours into the trip. Here is all that I remember. I can recall being out on my back patio staring into the river that ran behind my place. A green and black spider about 5 feet tall with legs the size of small trees wandered towards me. I wasnt scared because I remembered that I was tripping. I was amazed when the spider morphed into about 3 gold impalas which bounded off. I went inside to have a cigarette and got restless. My neighbor, whom I had known for a little while, perhaps 2 months, came down and we partied with some herbal refreshment of the green and sticky kind. After maybe a bowl or two I know I left to do something but I havent a clue what, maybe a short walk around my building due to being restless and I returned to my place. My neighbor left a few minutes after I got back.

I got the brilliant idea to have some more seeds after returning. It was at this point, after the seeds hit me that I blacked out and have no idea what happened. I wandered around as far as I know for a while longer. Here is where I get the shock of the evening. The next memory I have besides the constant movement of cigarettes is that of my friend saying that the cops were there and they wanted to see me.

I go outside thinking to myself Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, I am way too trashed to talk to the cops. So I walk up to the cop and try to introduce my self as best I could. He asks me ,Have you been up to my neighbors apartment today? I respond with something along the lines of no. He then tells me that my neighbor said I walked into her apartment and was staring at a wall while mumbling to my self. She asked me to leave at which point I did. The cop also said that she saw me in her car looking for something. I denied that as well. That didnt matter to the cops because the sober(ish) neighbor says that I did and she wants to press charges. I was told from the police when I was sober that during the ride to jail from the back seat I was singing Were going for a ride, were going for a ride!

While in jail I remember EMS checking me out at the jail, they said I was with it mentally enough that I was no danger to myself or anybody else. My vitals were fine so they allowed me to deny treatment and a trip to the hospital. My pupils were blown and my pulse was slightly fast but other than that I was fine. Such bullshit though, the truth of the matter was I was farther from just fine than anybody could have thought. I sat in a freaking chair for a day I think talking to imaginary people and real people alike. Everybody must have thought I was crazy.

The end result was that I had trespassing in the first and second degree charges pressed on me. I went to jail to detox until I was bonded out I think three days later. I had my first degree trespass deferred for two years and had to plead guilty to the second degree trespass charge to get the deferred plea bargain.

I regret this day more than any other day in my life. If I could have my way this plant would be made extinct. This plant has no real use in society thus it should be destroyed.

How does one defend their actions in court if they cant remember what the hell they were doing during whenever their supposed crime occurred? To this day I still wonder if it ever happened. All I know for sure is that I am a dumb ass for doing what I did and hope that I have not caused any permanent psychological dysfunction to the victims of my crime if it even happened. It was an incredibly bad experience.</bodytext></report>
