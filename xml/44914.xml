I have a passion flower plant in my garden, so i picked some and rolled it in a joint and smoked it. I gave me a buzz and the smoke really hurt my throat. I am going to try a morning glory/passionflower blend soon to see if it ampliflies the effects.I recommend it. It's a great alternative to tobacco.</bodytext></report>
