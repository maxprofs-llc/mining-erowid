Been drinking catnip and damiana tea for a while now; using it as an alternative to the illegal substance to relieve stress and enhance meditation sessions.

Smoking will give me the sensation quicker compared as a tea, finding out that the buzz is a lot longer as a brewed tea than smoked. For me smoking is too complicated; gets smelly, wastes a lot of the herb, not well for the lungs. Brewing tea on the other hand is simple to make, tastes good, most efficient method of inducing.

The herbal tea mixture gives me a mellow pot like floating buzz without the heavy jangled paranoid edge; will numb my arms and legs a bit and lasts for 1 to 2 hours. Its not the most potent buzz to be found, results in a laid-back relaxed disposition. Kicking back and listening to really good music helps.

Found at a local spice shop the catnip less than $1(us) an ounce &amp; damiana $2(us) per ounce. Figure for the price its a good deal besides cant go to jail for it.
