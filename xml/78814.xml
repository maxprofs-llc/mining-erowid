It really is a question of body chemistry.

I am a self-proclaimed hardhead. I have tried a few substances in my travels - MJ, coke, salvia, MDMA, ayahuasca, kratom, P. Cubensis, Wild Dagga (flowers and leaves), and Sinicuichi, and now Amanita Muscaria and  Amanita Pantherina. Of all these things, only MJ, coke, and P. Cubensis have ever affected me. I have taken substances with groups only to watch serious trips of others go downhill (Ayahuasca) and me going home afterward without any affect.

I decided to try Amanita Muscaria and Amanita Pantherina after much research since they are both organic and legal. I purchased 28g of EACH type from a reputable online ethnobotantist. They were Grade A caps picked in Washington state. I was planning to do these by myself, as I do all of my travels. The caps arrived dried so I did not heat them. since just under the skin is reported to be the most effective part, I decided to just eat them as is. The caps also contained the dried gills which I was a little bit concerned about for the nausea, but decided to eat anyways.

Because I knew I was going to have to assess/regulate my dosage over time I decided that my day off was ideal and would start early in the day. The research suggested eating a small meal beforehand to counter the nausea, so I consumed some minestrone soup and a small beef burrito. I had also read a lot about respecting this ally, so I meditated beforehand and said a simple prayer to the universe.

T + 0:00 Since I weigh 240 lbs. (108kg) I decided to ingest 10g of the Muscaria first and did so at 10:00 AM. After an hour I basically felt nothing so I decided to do laundry which is what I would normally do on my day off.

T + 2:00 By 12:00 PM, I felt absolutely nothing - no nausea, no sweating, no delerium. I decided to consume another 10g of Muscaria caps and waited.

T + 3:30 PM I felt absolutely nothing. Expecting I was going to be in the same boat as with the other ethnobotanicals I had tried, I ate 2 medium-sized Pantherina caps. From the research I had done, it was clear that Pantherina requires caution and is reputed to have higher concentrations of active compounds. One writer had compared Muscaria to 'riding a tiger' and Pantherina to 'riding a raging herd of tigers.' Many had indicated that they simply would never try them again. I put on a DVD and started watching a movie. Still feeling nothing, I dozed off (as I usually take a mid-day nap on my day off) and woke up at about 4:00 PM. At this point I had consumed about 20g of Muscaria and 5g of Pantherina caps with NO effect.

T + 4:00 I decided to eat more Pantherina so I ingested 4 more medium-sized Pantherina caps.

T + 6:30 I started to feel a sense of euphoria and very relaxed. This continued and kind of intensified. I had no sense of any nausea, delerium, or hallucinations. I had no OEVs or CEVs. Just a nice euphoria. Getting to this state required approx. 37g of Amanitas.  
/n
/n
T + 7:30 I decided to eat another 2 medium-sized Pantherina caps to see how far the buzz would intensify. 
/n
/n
T + 8:00 I had a nice light feeling to my body and the euphoria continued. Still, no no nausea, no sweating, no delerium, no hallucinations, no time shifty feelings, no inner dialogue. Nothing pushing me over the edge of the euphoria. Speech and thought are fully intact. Maybe feel a little giddy.
/n
/n
T+ 8:30 I consumed another 2 medium-sized Pantherina caps to see if I could even get beyond the mild euphoria - this state is quite enjoyable and relaxing, but nothing more. I have lost a little coordination but can handle tasks as if lucid. By this time I have consumed 20g of Amanita Muscaria and 20g of Amanita Pantherina - 40g of Amanitas.

12:00 This is where I am right now. I think I am just going to consume the remaining 16g of shrooms. I've peaked and am beginning to come down.

For all the research and warning, I have experienced none of the harsh side-affects and only a mild sedation/euphoria. I have no idea why this is, or why my body seems to process things differently from the majority of other people. Apparently, I must be the biggest hardhead in the world. And then, I can't explain why cannabis affects me so greatly if other ethnobotanicals provide only mild affects, if any.

If anyone knows the answer to this mystery or is interested in conducting research with me, I welcome it. of course, I understand that my experiences are unique, and most people would probably be hospitalized on 20g of each Amanita.

At the end of the day,I am thankful for the experience though.</bodytext></report>
