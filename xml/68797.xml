I took a 50mg pill under the impression that this was a painkiller.  My friend at school would often hand out painkillers, so I assumed the trazodone she gave me was a painkiller.  After the pill starts kicking in I have to go back to class.  I spent most of class with my head on the table, fading in and out of consciousness.  I also had a boner for like two hours, not in an aroused way, it was just there.  I do not intend to take Trazodone again, all it's good for is sleeping and erectile dysfunction.</bodytext></report>
