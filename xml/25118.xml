It was a night of hell.
/n
/n
This was just a day very weird.
/n
/n
I tried magic mushrooms for the first time. I had a wonderful night, perhaps one of the greatest moments I have ever had. On the night after, I was quite mellow but I decide to smoke a little of weed with my friends. I never knew what was about to happen! 
/n
/n
On that day, I was rather introspective. Side effects from the great mushroom first trip. I was initially happy on the morning but later more mellow.
/n
I even hesitate to smoke weed, but then I tried. Just a little, but of a strong type.
/n
/n
Initially, everything was ok. After some 20 min, I start to feel very stone and that was when everything began. I was beginning to feel a little weird, but without big problems.
/n
Then, one of colleagues start teasing with me (we had had a argue just the day before) but then he start to speak in a threatening way (he was also stoned). 
/n
/n
I lost control. I couldn't say a word, while he psychologically 'attacked' me. I saw a vision of an invisible demon behind him! I felt really scared! Then, I guess I was more into another dimension that in this reality (I guess mushroom the night before opened some otherworldly doors for me). I began to realize all the cause-effect notions of reality. It were so many time loops involved! I got literally crazy! I felt I was going insane. Times loops were just happening and happening, as well as time freezing (I felt almost into eternity). I was thinking that that night I would not be able to come back. Crazy as a lot of thought were dumping into my head and a lot were of a metaphysical essence.
/n
/n
There seem to be some weird being in that reality, evil ones that want to take me there. I resisted a lot. It was a internal struggle.
/n
/n
I felt I would die to the physical world. I would went to another dimension but a evil one. Drugs had unlocked that door. I repeat to myself and to everyone else 'Please talk to me, I am so bad. I feel I would never come back from this!' 
/n
/n
At first everyone was ignoring me, but later people start saying 'be calm, you just stuck yourself in a panic attack' and they kept thankfully talking with me. That was the big help. Before, I tried drinking water, sugar, coffee, washing myself, listening to classical music, having some fresh air, but nothing helped.
/n
/n
Later, I got better. There were some waving ins and outs but everything turn to reality. In that time, I was stoned and I felt I could control reality. Indeed I performed some things which would seem magical. I couldnt repeat them in my sober state.
/n
/n
I guess I learned a big lesson. Consciousness realms are to not to played with. Drugs open some special realms as they unlock some limits of our consciousness.
/n
I learned that we are also very selfish beings. That is ultimately detrimental for all of us. Time (and probably reality) are also very subjective (and originated from within us) things.
/n
/n
Since then, I smoke one more time (it was some days ago), and everything was ok. The amount that terrible night was quite small, but my feelings were not ok. I lost control, thankfully only for an hour.</bodytext></report>
