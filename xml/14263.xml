I filled my bong with ice and water (to cool the smoke) and smoked about 3 filled bowls of Blue Lotus while drinking some tea i made out of it. The tea sat for about 25 min.  About half way through the second bowl things seemed to get brighter and shook a little.  It also made me VERY tired.  I went into my house and as soon as i stood up i could feel something.  A very heavy buzz and something like a mild high.  I have done it since and recommend it for a sleep aid and a cannabis alternative.</bodytext></report>
