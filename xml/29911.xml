Having had a jar of 10 grams of 2aminoindan I've done quite a bit of expirementing with it. I find IV to be the best route of administration as the rush can be quite amazing and oral doses seem to require much more. The rush can be described as waves of tingling sensations traveling downward from the head and then waving up and down my body. Duration is about 3 hours, with no real comedown to speak of. I find 2aminoindan to be different then related stimulants as it seems to have a sedating rather then stimulatory action, mild increase in heartrate but no tweaking out like you'd get with other amphetamines or BZP for instance.</bodytext></report>
