first experience

=====================================================

arrived at friends house who said that they had sum mdma powder did i want it, knowing me i said yes without a second of thought but noted to them that my medication (antipsychotics) counter the effect of amphetamines and didnt expect much to happen. so i emptied out the bag and snorted to small lines about a half a point in total. 10-20 minutes later i started to feel really good simliar to what ice is like or really good speed. Increased heart rate and brain functions enhanced, i told them i didnt think it was mdma and they fessed up and said they werent sure what it was but i wanted more. so i rang up the guy who gave it to her and asked what it was and if i could get any more and i was told its mdpv otherwise known as meow. i had an excellent nite and stayed up all nite talkin and playing music

i got a 50bag (2.5 points) snorted 2-3 little lines and gave 4 other people a little line 20 mins later everyone was high as and jibbering rapidly and i still had more than half of the bag left. this drug is similar to ice in that it enhances my mood and like speed it increases awareness and artistic abilty. i didnt sleep that nite and went for a jam the next day and had a ball played music for about 8 hours strate with minimal breaks. /n  this drug (providing availability of chemicals needed to make it, or enough gets imported) i am guessing will be the new next big thing and if u ever come across it try it in very small ammounts (either that or were im gettin it must be pretty uncut). i cant wait for this drug to become popular and more people to have it cos its hard to find  /n
