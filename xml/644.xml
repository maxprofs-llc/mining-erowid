So it was a cold, dark Friday night and I invited 3 friends to come over and experience some LSA with me. Me and 1 other friend, C, had tried HBWR before but with only 8 seeds and moderate results. This time C and me decided to double up doses and go for 16 each, whilst the other 2, B and D, went for just 10 each. I ground them up, mixed them with warm water, and left them 4 hours to soak. Meanwhile my friends and I just generally messed around in anticipation of the experience. What would it be like at such a high dosage?

So at 10:00 PM we downed them. Almost immediatly I went downstairs to the toilet, and found it really hard to go. I then went upstairs and everyone was laying around complaining that they felt like shit and were gonna hurl. I lay on my bed ready to puke. Then one of my friends, D, threw up out of the window many times and said he felt way better. I nearly did loads of times but managed to keep it down. D then wandered off to play on his mobile phone on his own but me, B and D had this weird conversation that went on for about 2 hours, and basically just took the piss out of my girlfriend, and women in general. It reminded me of girls taking the piss out of us. We all laughed loads at utterly shit jokes, and my friend C, who had had 16 seeds, kept describing what he was seeing in the ceiling nd stuff. Me and B just thought he was weird.

C just lay there whilst me and B went over to my desk. It was hard to get there as walking was damn near impossible. My legs just wrecked and were really stiff to move. I then saw myself in the window and began having a conversation. B and C just took the piss out of me but I was deadly serious. I stopped after a while and I said to B that I'd give him 20 if he could bounce a mini basketball off the wall into the bin and make it stand up, which was impossible with the angle and small ball. But he tried and tried again, and suddenly this amazing game materialised, and we could relate every throw of the ball into a life experience. Like if it got stuck in a gap, this would be a difficlut situation that one must get out of if life was to continue. We were laughing and taking it really seriously, and then D came back up from downstairs. He wanted to join but me and B told him to get lost as it was our game. Loads of rules had suddenly materialised. Then C walked past us looking really, really ill. His eyes were just black, and his face bright red, and he could hardly walk. We all called him 'Tramp, Bum etc' and he just ignored us. However he came back up 20 minutes later and looked like shit. He said 'Lads I really think something is wrong' . We just laughed and said no way.

But he started freaking and saying he wasn't going to make it through the night and we all got scared. He kept sating it again and again. He said he couldn't imagine the next day's sky and would do anything to see it. He said he had written a suicide note a few days back and it seemed really ironic that it was happening now. We got shit scared and one of my friends went to talk to him. When he came back he said he looked weird and was acting strange. I went over and his whole chest and arms were like blue/grey! I nearly died. I was thinking of calling an ambulance but my friend D persuaded me not too. After that we just all sat there and fretted until 4:00AM. B and D both fell asleep and it was just me and C talking. He kept saying 'I hope I'm the same tomorrow man' and I kept saying he would be but I didn't know. We then stopped talking and tried to sleep but I couldn't. I was getting some wicked closed eye visuals - really nice stuff. But I couldn't sleep for thinking of my friend as this paranoid depressed dickhead forever.

When we woke it was so awkward. We just looked at each other for ages, not saying anything, watching the telly with mute on. In the end we just left one by one, with hardly any words explained because of what we had learnt about C.

On monday at school he said he had never actually wrote it and his head made it all up. I believe him, though D is more skeptical.

I'm blown away by LSA and if it wasn't for the constant nausea it would be fucking ace. Just make sure you ain't depressed when taking it though!</bodytext></report>
