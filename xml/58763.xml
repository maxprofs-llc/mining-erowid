My boyfriend and I decided to buy some of these at a retailer in England. We had gone in with the intention of buying shrooms, but we saw these and the clerk recommended them.

That evening, we each took six seed pods which we had scraped and soaked to the best of our ability. We still ended up having to do a lot of chewing.

After about an hour, we felt the first mellow, enjoyable effects of the trip. We felt very chill, and cracked up over certain objects in the room that suddenly looked hilarious to us.

Not long after, I began to feel a bit overheated and not-so-good, and my boyfriend was feeling the same.  We stood outside a while to get some air, but to no avail-- my boyfriend ended up retching in front of the building, and I ran into the bathroom to do the same.

We were both able to calm our bodies down a little, and sat on the couch. Things started to feel good again, we were feeling very frisky and decided to move the party upstairs.

After being 'intimate' for a while, my boyfriend started to get paranoid...he was definitely moving to the next stage of his trip...he was acting worried and confused, couldn't talk much... I asked him if he wanted to go back downstairs to the couch and he said 'I need to work out where we are first!' Trying to be the best trip-buddy I could be, I did my best to calm him and reassure him of where we were.  At this point I started getting tiny flashes of complete sobriety, and figured we were on our way back to normalcy.  This was nowhere near the case.

My trip began in full after a short while...it was not bad like my boyfriend's... however it was not good either.  Neither he or I had the desire to talk *at all*.  We each completely withdrew into ourselves, and verbalizing anything would have been very difficult.

I felt very calm throughout the trip, and found it difficult or too overwhelming to keep my eyes open, so I closed them for most of the time.  Even with closed eyes, I got rainbow-tinged racing-through-space visuals, including a revisit to the neighborhood we had walked through earlier in the day. Despite my calm, however, the trip felt physically uncomfortable to me, and I found myself hoping it would be over soon.

I felt nausea coming back... I could literally feel my stomach turn as it absorbed some of the substance, then feel a rush of the poison through my veins to my temples.  The headrush was very, very unpleasant.  The entire front of my skull felt intensely tingly.  Might sound cool, but wasn't.  Then the nausea became overwhelming enough that I went to the bathroom, made myself throw up, and repeated for the next six hours. 
/n

Eventually I got wise and smoked some pot, which calmed my stomach like a miracle.  I was able to go back to bed (though it was morning already).  My boyfriend's trip was over by that point-- he'd spent the whole time terrified that something was wrong with me but was unable to get himself together enough to come check on me.

In the end, I can't 'blame' HB Woodrose for my boyfriend's bad trip... bad trips happen with any psychedelic from time to time.  However, I would caution against using it because of the terrible physical symptoms it produced for me.  The only thing I could remotely compare it to might be the room-spinning-stomach-churning-head-racing-toilet-hugging bad drunk feeling.

Looking back, I should have 1)eaten only a little bland food before the trip, not a full meal or anything hard on the stomach, 2)started out by ingesting less than the suggested dosage of pods, and scraped and ground them better, and 3)smoked pot throughout the trip.  Ironically, it was my nausea that made smoking unappealing for me during my trip, but as soon as I actually took a hit, my nausea calmed down drastically.

In conclusion, this substance made me feel 'poisoned' much more so than any other drug I've ever taken, and this kept me from truly enjoying any of the visual aspects of the drug.</bodytext></report>
