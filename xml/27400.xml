I can describe it as 'The Holy Grail' of hallucinogens. Its effects were almost completely visual in nature. I felt almost sober the entire time I was on it. Anyone could have perceived me as sober, with the exception of very dilated eyes.

I took it at about 8:00 PM on Saturday, just as the kegger I was at started to rage. I began drinking at about 5:00 PM, and by 8:00, I had consumed quite a bunch, and was very tipsy. I drank to work up the courage to do it, and I'm glad I did. The night before, I had almost completely talked myself out of it over concerns about warping my thoughts too much toward the negative, as most hallucinogens do to me now.

I drank a little more over the next two hours, but very little, really. Over those two hours, I noticed no effects, however I did feel myself sober up (from the liquor) very quickly. At about 9:30 PM, I felt completely sober, and began to feel the drug coming on. It felt quite a bit like acid coming up. I felt electricity in my mouth. My palms were buzzing, and my torso felt almost imperceptibly twitchy or tense. Shortly after that, I began to see the slightest color patterns if I closed my eyes. I noticed that the decorative Christmas lights in the house were getting very bright.

About an hour after I first noticed effects, I began to wonder if I had taken enough. I had been sitting outside talking to people, and really didn't notice any new effects. I could walk around fine, I didn't get dizzy, I was able to speak coherently, I didn't stare at anything or anyone.* (I warn everyone NOT to re-dose at all.)

Shortly after I thought I may have under-dosed, I went into the bathroom to check on my eyes. The walls in the bathroom were wallpapered with ripped up paper bags. I looked at them for a bit, and realized that I had taken plenty. The patterns came out, and the walls gained depth.

Over the next couple of hours, the visual effects became extremely intense. I've never actually had visual hallucinations like this. I've had effects that made a door seem to flex a bit, but the walls were actually 'breathing' this time. At times the walls looked like a drop-rippled pond. Carpet patterns were extremely complex and deep (they seemed to penetrate inches into the carpet). There was an semi-round bathroom carpet that seemed to spin like meshing gears. Textured walls and ceilings revealed obvious fractal patterns. I had all this while feeling almost sober enough to drive. Nobody could tell I was on anything. I retained all of my ego and intellect. I could hold meaningful conversations without struggling for vocabulary. On other hallucinogens, achieving this degree of visual warpage, I would have been completely hosed.

Biting sarcasm and clever witticisms flowed like a river from my mouth. It seemed my comedy switch was stuck in the 'on' position.

I went to the bathroom to see if my face was warping, but it didn't significantly, and nobody else's did either.

*The only other significant sensory warping was my sense of beauty. (That's not quite right, but I don't know how else to describe it.) There were several pretty girls at this party, and I really had to stay conscious of how long I looked at any of them, to avoid staring. Several girls who I would normally find pretty, ended up looking extremely attractive. Others, of whom I wouldn't normally think much, looked the same.

The effects lasted approximately 11 hours, from dosage to sleep. I lay tired and awake on a couch for two hours watching the colored etch-a-sketch on the inside of my eyelids before I could sleep. If I concentrated, I could control the images to a limited degree.

Still, today, two days later, I feel energetic and happy. It was everything that I'd hoped for, and nothing I'd feared.</bodytext></report>
