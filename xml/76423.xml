I tested positive for opiates the day after taking a DXM containing product. I took about 200mg of Dextromethorphan HBr over a 24 hour period for a cold and an EMIT test was positive for opiates the next morning. I had heard of it causing false positives when taken in recreational doses. What I took was hardly recreational and it still caused the positive. I am on probation so they sent the urine to a lab for a GC/MS confirmation. After 10 days of stressing out about going back to jail the test came back negative.</bodytext></report>
