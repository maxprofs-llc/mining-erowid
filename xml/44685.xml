First off, the classification of this plant  I'd have to say is a mild relaxant.

I initially started off with 50 leaves and drank 10 of them in a slushie to drown out the taste... It was gross as hell and I said there was no way I was doing that 4 more times so I gave up and threw away the leaves.

About 10 minutes later I came up with another method of ingesting the stuff so I took the leaves out of the trash and hand squeezed the leaves into a cup, rolling them in between my hands helped. Then mixed the juice (about 3 tbsp) with a bunch of koolaid and drank it. About 30 mins later I had some crazy stomach pains but they went away in about 10 mins. After that I started to feel slightly drunk which is basically all this stuff does.

I'm pretty sure that the coleus tea works better but tastes terrible</bodytext></report>
