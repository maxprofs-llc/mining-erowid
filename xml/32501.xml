I've been out of cannabis for over a month, having only smoked a single bowl with a friend over a week ago.  This isn't great for me, as I'm a medical user, mostly for migraines and depression.  So because of a lack of pot, i've slowly gone back to my old headachy, easily bored self.

I decided to order some herbs I've never used from a nice online Pagan shop.  One of these included a bag of Damania, which I had never before used.
/n

It was around midnight and I had been doing some research on the herbs I got, largely online and in The Complete Guide to Herbal Medicines (which I had just picked up for a few bucks at b&amp;n), trying to decide how to go about experimental medical and spiritual use.
/n

I made a cup of tea, with a base of Republic of Tea's Chamomile Lemon and some extra valerian, along with good amount of that damania and some honey.  I also smoked bowl after bowl of straight damania, which was pretty easy to smoke, but left my throat sore (especially the next day).
/n
/n
I hardly noticed any effect, and the relaxation I felt, was probably from the valerian and the music I was listening to.  I kept smoking the stuff until my throat had put up with enough.
/n
/n
The first time I smoked pot I didn't realize I was high (just thought it was a good party), so my apparently lacking results are inconclusive.
/n
/n
My experience with damania has been fairly disappointing, but some time I'll try it again, without the valerian root, and see if it gets me anywhere.

At the time, I had been taking prescription medications such as Zyrtec, Prozac, Effexor and Strattera.  All were doctor prescribed of course.</bodytext></report>
