I began with a ton of research on LSA containing seeds; I wanted to ensure a positive, enriching experience.  I decided on the tried and true water extraction method.  After grinding the seeds as thoroughly as possible in a coffee grinder, I mixed it all in 2 1/2 cups of cold water, shook vigorously, and put it in the fridge.  For the next two days I shook it when I thought of it, and prepared mentally and spiritually for my voyage.  This included discussing the whole matter with my psychiatrist, who is unbelievably cool with whatever I throw at her.

It is time to embark, and so I FILTER the concoction.  The key is to not ingest the seed matter.  Eating the seed matter is completely unnecessary because the LSA compounds have all been transferred to the water.  After filtering it with cheesecloth to remove the big pieces, I then used a very fine sieve to get the smaller bits out.  The resulting tea was dark brown, clean, and smooth.  I drank it down, and smoked a bit of cannabis to get rid of the taste, which was not exactly bad, but a far cry from good.

Already feeling the effects.  My scalp is tingling, and I am giddy and giggly.

Feeling nauseous.  It is time to take an OTC anti-nauseate: Emetrol.  This is a liquidy syrupy stuff.  Read the instructions carefully.  What worked well for me was to take 2 teaspoons every twenty minutes for a total of 3 doses.  And voila!  Just some burping, but I'm feeling great.  Burping is good.

No cramping, no blurry vision, no nausea.  No pain at all, in fact.  Feeling good.  Listening to some good tunes.

I am starting to realize that this is going to be a very intense trip.  I underestimated the power of these seeds.  I should say that I have not had any hallucinogen other than cannabis for 5 years  I am very excited that I have found such an amazing legal, safe way to have a psychedelic experience.  It is time to take my dog for a walk.  (Should I say, it was time for my dog to take me for a walk).

Wow.  That was the most intense dog walk I have ever been on.  The gardens were so beautiful.  It's spring time here in California and the flowers are so fragant and colorful.  My dog was wonderful.  She was, and is, my guide through this part of my trip.  She charged ahead, and I gripped the leash and flew behind her like a kite.

I'm tripping hard.  This has far surpassed my expectations.  I'm no longer one with my ego.  My ego has made a nosedive for the window and a lot of emotions that I've been surpressing and stuffing are coming up strong and fast.  
/n
/n
The problem is, I'm feeling very alone.  My partner is gone for the weekend and so it's just me and the dog, and the three cats.  I really want to call my therapist, but will that be way too wierd?  I'm very afraid.  I don't want her to reject me.  I don't want her to say no, she can't talk to me if I'm tripping.

My mind is blown right now.  I'm crying.  It's all right to cry.  Just feel it.  Let it flow through me like waves.  I want to risk everything and call my therapist.

After an agonizing stuggle over whether to call my therapist, I pick up the phone and dial, leave a message.  I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

Holy shit what a ride.  I'm coming down now after a very emotional couple of hours.  My therapist called me back and we spoke for half and hour and I told her all the things I've been trying to tell her for so long now.  It just felt so right, the time was right to open up to her.  I'm feeling ecstatic right now.  This has been my crowning psychedelic experience.  No naptha or gritty seed meal required.  For that matter, no shady drug deal, no racing heart.  No puking.  A lot of peeing, but no puking.

My advice to potential MG and/or HBWR seed experimenters is to do everything you can to prepare yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  I was wise to chose a time of peace and beauty to drink the tea.  With a little planning, I am on a spectacular journey.  For me it worked well to go into my trip with a few issues I wanted to work through.  Combining the seeds was a powerful experience, not to be undertaken by someone who is unprepared.

I'm a seed convert.  I'll never do acid, mushrooms, or X again. All of the hallucinogenic/shamanistic experiences that I need are contained within these seeds. /n  Please purchase your seeds from a reputable internet source who specifies that they only sell seeds not treated with fungicide, pesticide, or any other nasty chemical you can think of. Don't expect a ton of  /n

 Not a ton of hallucinations or visuals with the seeds. This is an inner high. I remained 100% coherent throughout the entire thing. During the peak of 7pm to 8pm it was pretty hard. But I broke through it and here I am on the other side.

Good luck!  For me it was 10 years of therapy summed up in a matter of hours.  I never imagined that I would ever talk to my shrink while tripping.  This has truly been a remarkable experience.  I look forward to the future!</bodytext></report>
