Get Beautiful
/n
/n
Closer, 
/n
Minds open easy-
/n
get beautiful, 
/n
more useful, if flowers grow
/n
in the unconsious.
/n
Serenity siezes you quickly
/n
impaling your evils, 
/n
holding them to a clearer light
/n
which causes hate to dissipate. 
/n
/n
It's time to reconsider, 
/n
time to renegotiate-
/n
reality,
/n
as a whole
/n
And then with eyes fully open
/n
maybe the mind dances naturally. 
/n
Like colors that breath, 
/n
the same as i do 
/n
when ever sleep brings struggle, 
/n
and then sanity.
/n
/n
Believe- 
/n
you are divine, 
/n
concieve now
/n
all anger benign. 
/n
Within the world where peace pulses 
/n
through my body. 
/n
/n
Endlessly, 
/n
or ten minutes that comes in the pretence of forever. 
/n
Without malignance,
/n
with holding reason-
/n
and still nothing at all. 
/n
/n
With passion that makes you alive 
/n
and god inside of you, 
/n
glorifying your mind 
/n
and limbs
/n
and nerves. 
/n
through spasms of shiva
/n
flowing always in you. 
/n
Realize your breath-
/n
get beautiful.
/n
/n
/n
yeah, i think i liked it.</bodytext></report>
