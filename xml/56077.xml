About two months ago, I was forced to abrubtly end a two-month-old daily cocaine habit. Minor psychological withdrawals aside, that wasn't too bad. It's only after a few weeks that I've noticed that I may have done something awful to my mind.

I am numbed. A few of my emotions are intact, but even those are wild, fluctuating, unpredictable. I cannot at all, though, feel any real attachment to people. I am far more introverted. Despite attempts, I cannot seem to really care, or more severely, I cannot seem to really love anything or anyone.
