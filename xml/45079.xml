Recently I had a chance to try out some blue lotus.  I rolled a cigarette out of 5 flower tops and then proceeded to smoke it.  I got a very mild, almost unnoticeable buzz from it.  Disappointed from the results of smoking it, the next day I decided to eat 6 whole flower tops, the taste wasnt nasty at all, in fact it seems familiar.  I washed it down with the propel fitness flavored water, waited a while, and nothing.

I also tried it with wine, it gave me a very mild sedated feel.  I was trying to find a nice legal high, because I hate MJ. I like its scent, but the high is very annoying and uncomfortable for me.</bodytext></report>
