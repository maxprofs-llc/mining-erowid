I took approximately 12 mg of 2-CT-7 orally at around 10:30 P.M.  I am a 32-year-old male who has had some experience with mushrooms, LSD, ecstasy, psilocybin, and synthetic mescaline.  I had not taken any other illegal drugs other than marijuana in nine months.  I was with three other peopleone of which took 12 mg of 2-CT-7.  The other two people were sober.  In addition to the 2-CT-7 my friend and I had about three hits of marijuana directly after injesting the 2 CT-7.

I obtained the 2-CT-7 from a pharmaceutical source.  The substance had been kept at 80 oC for two years and then at 20 oC for approximately two months.  The powder was an off-white color with a granular appearance.  The weight of the 2 CT-7 was 72 mg.  I divided the 72 mg of 2-CT-7 into three roughly identical amounts (24 mg.)  I placed this 24 mg of 2 CT-7 in 10 oz (~220 ml) of 4 oC unsweetened grapefruit juice.  I mixed the powder thoroughly in the grapefruit juice for about two minutes.  My friend and I split the portion of grapefruit juice evenly.  Thus, the total amount of 2-CT-7 ingested was equal to (24/2) 12 mg of 2 CT-7.

DRUG EFFECTS
/n
/n
There was no immediate physiological response directly after taking the grapefruit juice containing the 2-CT-7.  I couldnt detect the taste of the 2-CT-7 in the grapefruit juice.  I did not have any initial nausea or any kind of gastrointestinal discomfort upon taking the juice.  My friend also could not taste the 2-CT-7 in the grapefruit juice and, likewise, did not feel any initial effects from the drug.

After approximately 30 minutes we went out to a club to see a well-known DJ at a club close to the house.  We had to wait almost an hour to get into the club and it was frustrating to get into the club as I had purchased tickets beforehand and wanted to get inside because it was cold and damp outside.  During this time I felt the first effects of the druga + experience at around 1.5 hours.  My attitude towards the drug was probably amplified by having to wait out in the cold for an hour so I wasnt a very happy person.  I felt a subtle kind of intoxicationnot hallucinogenic but I just knew I was under the influence.
/n
/n
My friend who had taken the drug with me also began to feel the drug at this time.  She was much happier and I could tell that she was under the influence.  We got into the club finally and I danced a little bit.  With MDMA I am much more into dancing and the physical pleasure associated with moving is nice.  With 2-CT-7 I didnt get that pleasure from moving that I did with MDMA, but also I didnt mind things that would normally irritate me.  The club was so crowded and I got jostled about quite a bit, but didnt really seem to care about that or the fact that it was so hot.  The 2-CT-7 didnt necessarily make the music sound any better and I really dont think that 2-CT-7 is a particularly great club drug.  It wasnt hallucinogenic and didnt enhance the feelings of dancing like MDMA does.  Still, the 2-CT-7 seemed to put me in a good mood and it wasnt at all unpleasant to be in a club environment.
/n
/n
The DJ stopped spinning at 1:30 a.m and I was disappointed that things were ending so early.  I never got the flights of fancy that I get from MDMA or the intense empathy that I get from that drug.  Still, the 2-CT-7 was nice and it was good to be with good friends and I found that conversation and relating to my close friends was effortless.  The drug is completely grounding and never at all wiggy.  I felt completely in control the whole night even though I was at a definite ++ and approached a +++

We went back to my friends house and hung out for about an hour.  I started to notice here, when things had chilled out a bit, the hallucinogenic qualities of the drug and the lights on the wall at my friends apartment took on a three-dimensional quality.  I left my friends house after a great night.  My friend who took the drug said that she had a great time and expressed an interest in doing it again /n I drove hometotally without incident.  I felt very much in control of the car and didnt really have any problems driving.  I noticed here that the drug definitely kept me awake and had a stimulant quality to it.  
/n
/n
I got back at 3:00 and tried to go to bed, but couldnt because of the stimulating quality of the drug.  Very cool hallucinations hereeven at this low of a dose.  The hallucinations compared favorably with the ones I had gotten on LSD or mushrooms.  There never was a sense of threat from the hallucinations and other than a brief moment I had very positive hallucinations all night.  I went for a walk at 4:00 a.m to work off energy and to get my CD player that I had left over at my apartment because I wanted to listen to music before I went to bed.  When I got back to the house I again tried to go to bed and couldnt.  
/n
/n
I should say here that I have an exceedingly low tolerance for drugs and it is usual for me to have very, very long tripsespecially on hallucinogens.  I didnt mind (much) the fact that I couldnt sleep because the hallucinations and the music were so nice, in-control and interesting.  Normally on mushrooms or mescaline I have more muddled hallucinations that arefor lack of a better wordkind of gooey.  The hallucinations I got on 2 CT-7 (and on LSD) were the ones I likesolid, bright, and sharp.  Lots of lines and graphs and math and Mondrian-esque visuals.  Very cool.
/n
/n
Finally, I found it harder to hallucinate and gradually got to the point where I found the comfortable darkness that ends a hallucinogenic trip.  It was approximately 6:30 am when this happened.  So the total length of my drug trip at 12 mg was 8 hours from ingestion to sleep.  It was a very favorable experience.

My friend also related to me in a personal email that she enjoyed the experience and wanted to try it again.

SUMMARY
/n
/n
All in all a very good drug experience at a low dose.  Very much in control the whole night with no sense of threat at all.  Good hallucinations when I got into a quiet place and I would recommend it for a night of getting together with good friends. It didnt enhance the music and the hallucinations that I got were inversely proportional to the level of aural and visual stimulation that I received.  I found 2 CT-7 to be a good drug for introspection and allowed me to look at myself with insight and without judgment.

My friend who took the drug basically confirmed my experiences on the drug.

SECOND TIME
/n
/n
I did 2 CT-7 again at a dose of 20 mg and ingested the drug in the same manner as above with grapefruit juice.  Again I went out dancingthis time to an underground dance party here in Seattle.  I had a much more negative experience that the above experience.  There was no sense of threat or any kind of physical toxicity.  I just had a feeling of wasted energy in the midst of a wasted life.  The introspection that had been friendly during my first experience became much harsher in judgment.  Again I never felt any kind of threat at allmore annoyance than anything.  At the end of the night I had had such a fundamentally bad night that my sense of humor kicked in and I began to laugh at myself at getting myself into such a predicament.  By 5:00 am I was pretty much back down to a ++ experience and left the venue.  I went home and had, again, some fantastic hallucinationscrystalline and linear.

I should mention that the night that I took this drug was my birthday so I probably was not in a very good mood.</bodytext></report>
