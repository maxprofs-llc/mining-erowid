First off i'm not exactly sure what the dosage of datura seeds was, but it was around 250 seeds throughout the day.  It all started at around 11:00 a.m. on a saturday, at that time i found some dead datura stramonium on my land. The seed pods on most of them were open, but they still had a lot of seeds in them so i gathered as many seeds as i could. When i got back to my house i crushed up about 100 seeds and put them in a tea bag and dipped it in some really hot water.  The water turned a yellowish green color which i put sugar in and cooled it.  I drank the whole thing around 11:30 a.m. and waited around for an hour for the effects to kick in, and when they didn't i ate about 75 more seeds, then i got a little impatient after half an hour and decided to eat another 75 seeds to ensure that i got effects off baseline.

An hour later (1:00 p.m.) the effects started to kick in, it wasn't very intense, but i did notice the effects.  My pupils became dilated, my heart was beating at a rather fast rate, (about 120bps) and all of the finger tips on my right hand felt like they were numb and swelling.  I had to be at work at 4:00 and since i didn't have any loss of motor control or any visual changes i decided to just go to work without eating any more seeds, my pupils were still dilated and my heart was still racing the whole time i was working.  When i got off work i decided to go out and get some allergy pills to trip off of since the jimson weed failed at giving me any hallucinations.  I am fairly experienced with the effects of the allergy pill trip and about 23 or 24 pills with 25mg of diphenhydramine usually gets me to a good hallucinogenic state, but i have never talked to or even seen people that weren't there until this night.

I took 23 pills around 7:00 p.m., not thinking that they would intensify the chemicals in the datura seeds, but maybe i should have thought about it because i could have killed myself.

Around 8:00 i got a ride back to this party house i have and the effects started to kick in, i got a really heavy feeling throughout my whole body and i felt really tired.  I didn't tell anyone at the house that i had taken anything but i did start smoking this half joint that i had when i got there, i was sitting out on the front porch with one of my best friends while i was smoking it.  After a few minutes of talking to him he could tell i was really fucked up because i would forget what he was talking about in the middle of his sentences and i would constantly call him different names, his name was jimmy and i kept on calling him kyle, sam, or sometimes brandon. So i decided to tell him what i took and he just laughed about it a little bit and we just sat out there for a little while longer while i finished my joint.  It was really hard to finish it though because i would forget i was smoking it and i would drop it all the time and had a hard time finding it because it was dark and i would hallucinate a bunch of joints all over the ground, my friend usually had to find it for me.  When i got done with my j we went to kroger for some reason to see if my brother was working.  We walked in and i was walking beside jimmy in the store talking to him, i later found out that jimmy never walked in there with me in the first place and i was talking to thin air, he was just outside the store laughing at me talking to myself.  This is the point where i stopped remembering jimmy said he came into kroger and started asking me who i was talking to and i asked him if he wanted to sell the van(neither me or jimmy have ever had a van in our lives) so he just walked me back out to the car.

He said that when we got in the car i started talking to someone in the back seat who wasn't there, i said it was my ex girlfriend and he said i talked to the imaginary girl for a long time, but he couldn't understand what i was saying, i was talking to quiet and i was mumbling most of the time i think.

The effects must have worn off slightly by the time we got back to the house because i can remember getting back there and being there.  When i got there i started talking to some people there who could tell i was really fucked up by the way i was talking, so i just told them i took some allergy pills (they would have been mad if i said i ate jimson weed because it's poisonous) and they believed it because i was acting like i usually do on them.  While i was there i remember picking up this container that was full of weed, i remember playing with the weed for a while saying that we should roll it up and smoke it, but everyone said that there was nothing there.  I remember looking at it and feeling it in my fingers and it seemed so real, it was crazy.  After a while of sitting there me and my brother decided to go home and all the way home i was having slight dreams where i would be in a conversation with someone and i would talk back to them and the second i did i would wake up and my brother would ask me what i was talking about and i just said i didn't know.  At one point in the ride home i saw car lights in the distance that said something to me and when i talked back they disappeared, it was nuts.  When i got back to my house i got in my room and started looking for something, i don't know what it was, but i figured i would remember when i saw it.

I never found whatever it was that i was looking for and i decided to go to sleep.  I had a bunch of vivid dreams that night and i couldn't tell if the events in my dream really happened or not, i was so confused in the morning.  I was still seeing things in the corner of my eyes and almost everything that moved was trailing that whole next day and my pupils were still very dilated.  I have stopped doing all drugs since this experience because i believe that i was close to death, i played with poison that night and i believe i am very lucky to be alive today.  I hope nobody else ever tries datura or allergy pills, at the time of the intoxication i didn't know the hallucinations weren't real so it wasn't any fun at all.</bodytext></report>
