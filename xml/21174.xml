It all started yesterday at noon, my friend D came over with a 4 grams of weed and 8 50mg Ultram pills.D told me that Ultrams were cool while smoking weed. I could have never dreamed of the effects of the two combined.

(times are approx. and were written while on the drugs)

So D and I sat down at about 12:15 and took 2 50mg Ultram pills each with a glass of water.

T+0:05-We sat down and smoked 2 grams of weed.

T+0:15-We're really high right now and decide to take 2 more Ultram pills each.

T+0:20-D and I smoked the rest of the cannabis.

T+1:20-Still high, itching, feeling good but starting to get tired.

/n
T+1:40-I finally get up to go to the bathroom, balance is weird, its hard to stand or move.
/n
/n
T+1:45-Back from the bathroom, time is slower or so it seems.
/n
/n
T+2:10-Talking seems to be distorted somehow.
/n
/n
T+2:35-My friend D has to leaves and I begin to feel slightly paranoid.
/n
/n
T+2:55-All paranoia is subsiding and I start to feel really really good, a feeling closer to ecstasy but a weaker effect and without the hallucinations.

/n
T+5:45-D left and had to go home for the night.
/n
/n
T+5:55-My skin feels smooth and slick.
/n
/n
T+6:05-I'm sweating puddles.
/n
/n
T+7:30-Im still higher than my life and I decide to lay down and go to sleep.
/n
/n
T+7:40-About to fall asleep.
/n

I woke up today around 10:30 and I feel great and refreshed. It was a good experience overall. I don't know how or why it gave me those feeling but I hope I get the same exact effects from them again.</bodytext></report>
