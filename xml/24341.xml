I stumbled across jimsonweed by accident as it was growing in my uncle's garden, for which it was part of a project of photography for a medical institute on medicinal herbs and plants.  I began reading about the uses of it after hearing from my uncle the reason for him growing such a thing.  I had found rather inconclusive information ranging from week long delusions and 'trips' to a useless waste of time from the plant.  i began myself by ingesting a number of around 10 seeds over the course of an hour the first time i tried it.  following approximately an hour after ingestion i simply felt stoned and there were minor visual distortions limited to changes in my surrounding in my peripheral vision.   i repeated this a few more times on other occasions without much result.  i then tried smoking the crushed seeds and found that it simply makes you feel uneasily detached and can cause a rather nasty case of nasuea the next day.  from here i proceeded to try making a tea.  i found succesfully that if ten to twenty seeds are boiled in 2 cups of water for fifteen minutes you have the desired substance.  the seeds simply start to break down and there is a clear goo that is left from the seeds though they are still whole in most cases.  you can strain the seeds if you like but you have more of a chance of draining the goo, which when taken seperately if you can manage that really gets you going.  the effects were felt roughly a half hour later and not entirely disappointing, in fact rather nice.  i felt again basically stoned but with clear perception of my enviroment.  some minor visual distortions followed such as difficulty focusing to vivid patterns of color when my eyes were closed.  my sense of balance was greatly diminished with out my noticing until i was about to fall over.  it lasted through the remainder of the evening, it was ingested around 8 pm.  the next day i felt generally euphoric but tired.  i don't recommend this for everyone, my brother can't handle it.  remember that if you are going to try this that atropine, one of the psychoactive constituents, is a poison and has been fatal in many cases of overdose.  treat it with respect and don't do it often.  good luck and i hope this helps someone.</bodytext></report>
