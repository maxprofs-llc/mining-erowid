I extracted a tar like resin from wild lettuce by steeping the leaves in boiling hot watter 3 times, rincing between steepings. Each steep was 2 hours. Disgard the tea from this, soaked the leaves in Isopropyl alcohol in a hot attic for 3 days, evaporated the alcohol in a glass pie pan with a very small fan. What I get from this is a dark green tar that (1/2 a match head size ball) smokes like hash oil and hits the head almost as hard as hash oil.</bodytext></report>
