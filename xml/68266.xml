Me and one of my friends took 30mg each of cyclobenzeprine, which was an extremely dissapointing expierience. I had taken klonapin in the past and was not a fan of benzos which it was much like. It just made me tired dissoriented, depressed and iritable. The effects lasted around ten hours and toward the end of what had been a miserable expirience, I drank some vodka which proved to be a good combo that was very dissorienting and a wonderful exscape from this shitty world we have the curse of living in.</bodytext></report>
