/n
3:40 AM:  The trip has deffinently started. There is slight waving and a little patterning.
/n
/n
4:00 AM:  We wind up on a golf course in a neighborhood. Trip is really begining to kick now. trees are bending. its all over happiness while running. Experiencing extreme auditory distortions. things beggining to change colors. We start making art in the sand dunes which include a big heart with the letters lsd inside and death 2 bush. We really wanted to give those rich assholes a surprise.
/n
/n
4:30 AM:  Trip was getting way to intense to be running around a golf course in peoples open backyards so we leave.

5:20 AM:  End up at callos to drop him off. Matt runs to get a drink from callo. I begin to feel like puking. open the truck door and fall out lay there and look at the stars change colors then puke while laying on my back (not good).

8:30 AM:  Get a call from callo. Hes having a really bad trip. Thinks hes gonna die. Get to his house in hes not in good shape so me and my buddy try to help him out. We start freaking out so we call two fellow hallucinogen enthusiasts to come help. Were to fucked up to at this point in time. Shit is swirling together colors are changing in the span of half seconds.

It was fun but I would not do it again. I puked a  total of 6 times allthough it really was more potent then lsd. like I said it was way to much throwing up and bad body feeling also a nice migrane.</bodytext></report>
