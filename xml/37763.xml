Let me start by saying that I have been a 'hard-head' with the vast majority of substances I have tried.  This dose level could be much more dangerous to someone with typical response to salvinorin.

Here are what my experiences were like prior to my last one (read very mild)

My last experience with sally:

Situation.  I had taken 50 mg of AMT a couple hours prior, and was not impressed with the effects.  Overall, I would say that the effect of AMT was irrelevant to the experience I am about to describe.  I had found Salvia to be fairly mild and short acting, and was going to try a much higher dose to find out it it was worth pursuing any more.  It was about noon, and I loaded a tradtional tobacco pipe with all the remaining 5x salvia I had - about 400 mg.  I went outside on my porch and sat down.  I looked around the residential neighborhood, and figured I would be inconspicuous in the middle of the day smoking a tobacco pipe.  I was pretty efficient at smoking the pipe - taking long deep hits, and holding them in for almost a minute each.  I would say that I smoked most of the material that I had put in the pipe.

The experience began with my legs turning into a combination of vines and leaves.  This was not your typical hallucination.  I didn't have a sensation of vines and leaves growing on me.  I didn't feel them.  I didn't look down and see them.  I knew that it was happening.  It started at my feet, and worked it's way up my entire body.  I was turning into a human shaped plant creature.  This is the only time in my life (and that with a lot of drug experience) that I was something else.  Sure, I have lost control of my actions, or been completly overwhelmed and unable to move.  This was different.  I wasn't me, but just fucked up.  I wasn't totally lost in hyperspace.  I was gone, but another being was sitting on the porch.

The leaves of the tree in front of me took on an extra waxy, extra-3-D look, as if they were much thicker and full of life.  About this time, a mother and daughter came into view walking on the sidewalk - maybe a block away.  The girl was maybe 5, and talking to her mom.  Remember, there is a plant creature sitting on the porch.  I don't understand what the girl is saying.  I don't speak English.  I just have animal instincts.  Fortunately for all involved, my animal instincts tell me to run away from people and hide.  Due to a genetic throwback or something, I am able to operate the door, run into the house, know which room belongs to me (ie is safe), shut the door and jump on the bed.  As I lay on the bed, I look up at the plain white walls and see ribbons of color hanging from the edges between the ceiling and wall.  It's moving clockwise around the room.

I am now a couch.  Once again, I am not absorbed into the couch.  I am not a couch with eyes.  I am, and have always been a couch.  I think about what it's like being a couch - just sitting there all day.  That's all I do.  Sometimes people sit on me, but I don't feel it.  I don't have skin or nerve cells.  I'm just made of cloth and wood and metal and am a couch.  I never move.  I don't care.  I just am.

Finally, I come back.  I realize that I am laying on my futon, and that I was recently a couch, and before that, a plant primate of some sort that has never existed.  I feel glad that I didn't hurt anyone or get myself in trouble, and feel lucky that I made it through this without a sitter.  OEVs are fading fast.  CEVs are still there.  A bunch of weirdness, but nothing special to mention.

I realized that Salvia does contain a lot of power, and is to be respected.  I don't find it to be of much value at lower doses, and find it to be surprisingly, perhaps scarily 'different' at higher values.  I wouldn't describe it as overly intense, but to be completely subject to the wills of other beings than yourself is pretty risky.

This was about 4 years ago.  I keep salvia available, but have not gone back to it yet.  Two things keep me away.  One is fear that the being I become will do something bad.  The other is that, while I found the experience remarkable, I really wish the experience could be longer than the 10 minutes or so that it lasted, so I turn to other things that last longer.

If Salvia could be made to last an hour, I think it would be an amazing thing to explore.  As it stands, I keep it in my toolbox, and mostly just warn others not to take it lightly.</bodytext></report>
