Informal home study on detection times (because I now work for a government contractor): I recently had to quit regular use of weed due to working for the communist facist's we call our government.  Due to my inability to completely quit I decided to test our testers.  Phase one is to determine what my personal detection times are.  I have used common over the counter drug test kits available at the local drug store.  What I have determined is the following: After having not smoked other than one or two hits off of a pipe on Friday night (very potent weed-did the trick) I have consistently tested clean by Sunday evening of the same weekend.  So far I have performed this ritual 3 times.

My next course of action is to investigate the use of synthetic urine.  Since I am paranoid wondering if they can detect fake urine, I am planning on ordering a couple of samples and submitting them to legimate drug testing labs personally to see what their response is.  I will post a follow-up with my results.  We all need to share information to beat this nonsense being dumped on responsible pot smokers.
