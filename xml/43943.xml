LSD was always my favorite drug and I have not had connections for it for a long time.  I read about 2C-I and decided to give it a try.  It was described as similar to LSD and 2CB. I'm very experienced in hallucinogens.

I purchased 100mg from a reliable seller.  I eyeballed 5 piles of 20mg each.  I took one pile and made it into 4 piles of 5mg.  I put 20mg in a small shot of water and downed it.  My friend put 5mg in his beer.

I started to feel it in about a half hour.  My head started feeling very pleasantly cloudy.  Colors intensified.  After 45 minutes, I could see the carpets and walls making shimmery waves.  This breathing movement was very much like a moderate dose of LSD.  It would usually take me at least 4 hits of LSD to get the visuals I was getting at this point, and this is only an hour into the trip.

So exactly one hour into the trip, my friend who had drank 5mg decided to snort 5mgs. I snorted 5mg as well making my total 25mg and his total 10mg.  We immediately felt a rush coming to our brains from the insufflation.  The visuals are now getting very intense.  I am seeing beautiful geometric patterns everywhere.  They are similar to LSD visuals, especially with the melting movements.  It usually takes me 6 hits of LSD to achieve these kinds of visuals.

I played Viewtiful Joe, an extremely visually trippy video game, and we watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which was the perfect choice.  I really enjoyed 2C-I.</bodytext></report>
