Okay, I've tried my fair share of drugs, one party night after running out of alcohol I decided to take some of my soma stash. Oh christ, I had already drank a 6 pack of Sparks (alcohol/energy drink) and had a decent buzz on but didn't especially feel like sobering up just yet. So I grab 3 somas, chop them in half and shortly all hell broke loose.

First came the rubbery-numbness....no problem.....then came the soma shuffle....that I can handle......anything after that I don't remember.</bodytext></report>
