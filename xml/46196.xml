I recently tried Leonotis nepataefolia (wild dagga) which I bought off the internet in Australia.

I've been smoking it at uni and at home, by myself or with friends. I find it approximately half as strong as ground grown marijuana.  I have been having rollies but I bought a pipe to use which is less time-consuming. It's reasonably harsh on the throat, but certainly still smokable.  I did loose my voice a bit, from smoking it.  It kind of strips the lining off my throat and I always have water handy.  A bong would probably be easier but I haven't tried it like that yet. A friend of mine coughs a lot when he smokes it.

I get pretty relaxed when I smoke it.  I recently had a break up and have found it excellent in soothing my nerves, helps me cope.  I feel giddy and a bit high immeadiately while smoking it and it lasts a couple of hours.  I smoked in the morning and went to uni in the afternoon and I was giggling uncontrollably.

It smells a fair bit like pot.  I couldn't really smoke it publicly because people sniff and stare.  It doens't make me paranoid like pot does, possibly because it is weaker.  It is also dirt cheap, I got 10 grams for $5 Au dollars, and pot is $20 Au dollars a gram here.

I've been smoking 2 cones or 2 rollies and that is nice and enough for me.  I think exercise brings it on as well because going for a walk seems to reinvigorate it.  I don't hallucinate or anything on it, but I giggle a fair bit and come across as pretty stoned.  It's hard to concentrate properly at uni if I smoke before class.  It's a depressant.

I have been drinking after smoking, which is much the same as drinking after smoking pot.  I feel kinda nauseous but drunk/high at the same time is still good.

A relaxing, easy-going high.</bodytext></report>
