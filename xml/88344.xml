I had ground up a large portion of home grown MG seeds a day before. The next day, me and R smoked a blunt, but ground up our weed in the same grinder as I had used for the MG.

After smoking we went on a drive to a fast food joint. During the ride there, I saw different spectrums of light, like I could see people's cell phone signals, and mild tracers. R also reported 'tripping' but he is not a psychonaut so I cannot be sure of the accuracy of this statement. This leads me to believe that LSA is smokable.

I will be trying it soon with HBWR seeds because I have a large quantity.</bodytext></report>
