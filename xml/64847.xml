I am 25 years old.  I have a history of general anxiety.  I began taking Paxil a while ago and recently increased my dose.  I have Clonazepam on hand to use as needed, which is not a common occurance.  I smoke marijuana regularly and have taken Adderall, Ritalin and Focalin in efforts to combat ADD.  I drink 3-5 energy drinks a week.

Long story short, I jumped from ADD medication, one to the next, and they worked.  For a short time.  On each medicine, I built a tolerance quickly and had to take larger doses in order to attain the same benefits, and quickly couldn't attain many benefits at all without a dose that would create problematic body response.

I was prescribed 200mg Provigil (Modafinil) in an effort to find an alternative medication to assist with my ADD.  I was also prescribed the medicine to help combat the lethargy and excessive sleepiness I had begun to experience on my increased dose of Paxil.

Having slept from 9am to 3pm on day 0, I found myself still wide awake in my apartment three hours into day 1, 3:00 AM.  Finally, at 4 AM I feel suddenly exhausted.  I would have just slept, but I needed to be awake at 7:30am to ship a package.  I didn't want to miss the overnight deadline with my carrier so I rationalized the use of some of the Provigil.

/n
4:10am  :  take 200mg Provigil tablet with full glass of Gatorade.
/n

I go back to my computer and try to play a videogame to stay awake until the medication kicks in.  I know my ways, and if I fall asleep as an upper is kicking in, all I get is fitful sleep.  I quickly realize the perfect time killer is a cigarette.
/n
/n
4:25am  :  I was enjoying the view of the city lights reflecting off the clouds, but as I finished my cigarette my stomach started hurting.  I assumed it was the microwaved dinner food I ate just around midnight.  Either way, that cigarette sure kicked my head into working shape.
/n
/n
4:32am  :  I'm not really sure it was the cigarette.  I remember that I have a relatively empty stomach, so I could be getting effects.  I'm actually a bit excited since this is the first time I've taken the medicine.  I want to see if my doctor and I have found a good solution.
/n
/n
5:03am  :  Sorta forgot about the report, I found a guide for the game I was playing online and got caught up.  While playing I was taking mental notes of changes.  My 'accuracy' in the videogame was definitely increased from the time I loaded it up and closed it.  I would attribute it to natural skill, but I play the game at least a small bit everyday so I began to think this may be a similar effect between the Ritalin/Adderall stimulus and Provigil.
/n
/n
5:30am  :  Its helping my ADD.  But not in a way I expected.  My mind almost subconsciously categorizes my thoughts and discards those of no import in the immediate future.  I started reading one of the Harry Potter books after the earlier note regarding gaming.  I found that I could read much like I can on Focalin:  I maintain a quick clip down the pages yet truly take in what I view, whereas without these types of aids I tend to go so many as 10 pages before noticing I do not recall the last several pages I read.
/n
/n
There is something interesting here, though.  My body feels tired.  My arms and feet feel heavy.  But my head feels subtly electrified.  I had been listening to an EP (half-length music album) which I just received from a friend earlier that night, and upon first listens even in conjuction with reading learned most of the lyrics of all the songs.
/n
/n
5:37am  :  200mg Provigil with half-liter of water.  I then go directly outside with the last of my pack of cigarettes, figuring I'd watch the sunrise, something I tend to sleep through.  It's lighter outside and I notice a third thing about the effects of this substance.  My vision seems to be improved.  Not in the sense that I could wear a lighter prescription of contacts or whatnot, but objects look much more defined.
/n

I was fascinated by this, and spent fifteen minutes trying to 'focus' my eyes, even 'zoom' them.  I noticed I could see the fine grains of our porch much more clearly than I recalled seeing them before.  It felt that prior to taking the medicine, my eyes were a digital camera that took perfectly recognizable pictures, but now had a few more megapixels to really sharpen the corners and make things 'pop.'  
/n
/n
5:58am  :  I light the cigarette, and smoke about half of it slowly, enjoying another aspect of the medicine I noted:  confidence.  I felt very 'everything is alright.'  I live in a neighborhood with lots of theft and attempted breakins, even some armed holdups.  Anytime between 1am and 7am I feel uncomfortable being on our porch.  At this point in time, I felt - quite simply - logical, and my mind made no fuss over my body's current location as it usually does.
/n
/n
As the cigarette came to its end, I noticed a very prominent buzzing feeling in my cranial area.  I would attribute it to the nicotine, but I smoke fairly regularly and the buzz was very, VERY similar to that of getting a triple tall extra shot latte at your local coffee shop.

In total I took 400mg of Modafinil over the course of a few hours and smoked two cigarettes.  I have never felt this sort of mental clarity in my entire life.  It has an anti-anxiety/depression component to its use, that's a sure bet.  I simply felt logical, in control and irrational thoughts were turned away at the door, more or less.  In the time not covered, I felt extremely motivated (excited, actually) to clean my room and clean the porch.  Once I got the jobs done, I felt more rewarded than I ever have in my recent memory.  Yet, my mind was still being its old goofy self.  Jumping from subject to subject, but with such clarity.

Modafinil seems to be something that could change a large portion of the population's lives.  I mean, I've also noticed that I feel more compassionate and inclined to do favors.  It's early afternoon now, but I still feel warm and aglow.  I was ecstatic when my apartment mate finally woke up so I could converse.  Maybe the medicine interacts with SSRIs, who knows, but it sure has a whole lot more to it than narcoleptics.  Yet, the commercials market the pill to people suffering from 'excessive sleepiness.'</bodytext></report>
