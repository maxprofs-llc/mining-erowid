experience: nozinans are often compared to cannabis or THC tablets a dose of 25mg is compared to 1/2 gram of cannabis with a touch of PCP. They are antipsycotics, so no halucinations are involved, just a warm glow. I once took three in one day, i felt like if i had smoked two grams of pot, a quarter gram of hash and half a cap of pcp. The dose seems to be parabolic. the side effects are twitching and small muscle spasms.</bodytext></report>
