This drug can be useful for withdrawing from opiates or as an alternative to street heroin or other opiates. I feel my own experiences could provide solidarity perhaps for other users who have tipped the balance of sensibility... OK, now for my History:

I have been continally prescribed 12 mg per day of buprenorphine (subutex)  as an alternative to methadone or a street heroin addiction for the last three years, before which I was a heroin addict for one and a half years. For the first year or so I just took 4mg per day sublingually and found that this held me, i.e.- stopped me from feeling withdrawal symptoms, for between 24-30 hours per dose. During this time, I discovered that although Buprenorphine did inhibit the effects of opiates, this greatly depended upon the dose; the individual, and the time elapsed after taking the dose. Simply, the higher the dose taken, the more effective at blocking other opiates for longer.

I am sure that it could be considered `dangerous` for people to take benzodiazepines with buprenorphine, but I have taken large amounts of each, on many occasions, as have many people I know, and experienced nothing worse than the usual sedating effects of the benzos. If you have no tolerance to Opiates or Buprenorphine, it could be dangerous for people who aren`t used to it to mix it with too many benzos.

Amyway, onto a much more previously unmentioned subject, is the intravenous use of buprenorphine. I was injecting 12mg of Bup three times a day for a few weeks (before I went back on smack to stop fucking myself up, and now I have been on 4 x 2mg hits a day for about three months, but, hey!!), and found that it makes my veins very unelastic, hence I rapidly discovered the best way to prepare this drug for injection to minimalise bodily harm, although it is NEVER harmless to inject this stuff.

Anyway, as follows I:
/n
1) place the appropriate dose of subutex or bup in my nice clean spoon. 
/n
2) Add the correct amount of water so that I will be able to hit up in the appropriate quantity in one go, and then mix well with, preferably, the cap of a sterile works until I can feel no crumbs or grains in the spoon, within reason.  
/n
3) LEAVE FOR AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR for the impurities to settle, or as long as I can, then
/n
4)  Get a clean filter, from a straight or a filter tip for a home-made, and cut a thinnish slice off it as I would a Swiss roll, so I still have a full width bit, but not too long. 
/n
5) Drop this widthways into the centre of the spoon, so that the fibres run horizontally, and then proceed to slowly and carefully draw up the liquid through the filter. I should find that most of the impurities stay at the base of the spoon. 
/n
6)  Whilst Intravenous injection is certainly not good for me, injecting into skin or muscles has been shown to lead to a high chance of developing abscesses on those sites. I have injected this stuff, foolishly, a great deal intravenously, missed a few times, but never had an abscess, although, it is bad for my overall circulation, veins, and spare a thought for the kidneys.

It`s usually only worth doing if I'm so ill withdrawing from opiates then it can`t get any worse, but everythings relative and everybody`s different, so hey, this is my contribution anyway.</bodytext></report>
