Ever since I went to see The Queers in 1995 my ears have rung continuously. I realized that I would never experience silence again and was very sad. Luckily I heard that ginkgo taken as a supplement can help with tinitus (constant ringing in the ears due to exposure to loud noise). I decided to try it and for about a year took ginkgo . I do not remember the exact brand or dose, it was just something I bought at walmart and took a couple per day. What is remarkable is that the ringing in my ears decreased in volume significantly.

I experimented with taking it for several weeks and then stopping and vice versa and noticed a lag of several days between the onset or decrease in effect. I emphasize that the effect was dramatic. Constant loud ringing like after a concert (left ear especially) and then a low ringing after taking ginkgo.

After about a year I discontinued it and noticed that the ringing didn't come back like before. My ears still ring but not nearly like they did before. I do not necessarily attribute the long term improvement of my condition to ginkgo, but I can say confidently that ginkgo greatly eases acute tinitus. This effect has now been well verified in the medical literature. I noticed no effects on my memory or concentration whatsoever.</bodytext></report>
