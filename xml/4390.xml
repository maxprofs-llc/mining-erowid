Report on the effects of three years of weekly MDMA use (note:last use ever was 4 months ago). Often Xanax (a benzodiazapene) was taken to turn the drug off at the end of the night. Xanax dependance is an unintended result.

Fear - seratonin depletion may be permanent. Trying to see if Zoloft (an SSRI) will replenish seratonin and cure depression and insomnia. Beware - weekly use not recommended. Never again for us.</bodytext></report>
