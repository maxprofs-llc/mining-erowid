I feel extremely guilty about this, but to accomplish this trip, I stole the hydrocodone from my aunt's prescription. A moment of desperation to feel different on anything, I guess.

It was about 9 PM, and I just woke up from a nap. Knowing I had the hydrocodone, I immediately took 4 of the 7 tablets I had. I took 4 because I knew that went fine the first time I did it.

I made sure to lounge in my bed, instead of being active (like I did the first time, which made the onset longer than it should have been). I started feeling the effects about 45 minutes later. It started out as a very mild calm, then all of the sudden it whooshed in.

I swear it was like a body orgasm. I took another, hoping to extend this feeling as long as possible. Everything felt good, and it seemed like nothing could ruin the trip.

Sometime between 10:30 and 11:30, I got up from my bed and walked around my apartment. Everything was slow. I felt like I was walking normally, but when I really looked at how I was walking, it was a slow, basically tip-toe around the house. I got back into bed five minutes later, after the novelty of my slow walking wore off, and let the feelings of calm consume me once more.

I took another tablet, sometime around 12. I really hoped this feeling would stay. I needed it too. It felt like I was going to cry once it was over. At around 12:15, I took the last one. I rubbed myself on my blankets, my stuffed animals, anything that felt good. I pet my cat, and it felt amazing. Everything was so calm, and I had a permanent smile plastered on my face.

At around 3, I felt everything wearing off. I felt like crying because I already missed it. And I already exhausted my 'stash' of tablets, so I had nothing to look forward to having later. Then, it felt like I just blinked, and I looked at the clock again, and it was 6 AM. Somehow, I fell asleep for 3 hours, and it only felt like a blink. This happened the first time I was on it as well. Then, I had to get up to go to school. I was fine all through school, and I felt really peaceful all day. The only thing was that I already missed it.

I love the feelings that hydrocodone gives me. Everything feels warm and fuzzy, and fantastic.</bodytext></report>
