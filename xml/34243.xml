just recently i smoked a bowl of california poppies and it was one of the most amazing experiences i have ever had. it was about 11:00 at night and the full moon and stars were out. i turned all the lights off in my room and filled my pocket pipe up to the brim with raw california star (my nickname for california golden poppies--they look starlike to me). the stuff was a little rough on my lungs at first and i coughed a little but i eventually got used to it. upon finishing the bowl i set down my pipe and walked outside to see the night sky. i lay down in the grass and gazed up at the bright stars above. five minutes passed and i began to feel extremely relaxed and at peace with myself. i concentrated on one star and all the other stars began to 'fade' out. i felt as if i was being drawn into my star and as if i knew all there was to know about it (its name, what it was [galaxy, planet, supernova etc.]). when i stopped concentrating on that one star all there other stars reappeared with a flash the literally made me blink.

i glanced over at my house that felt miles away and thought 'maybe i should be getting back now' but i couldn't stand up, and, more importantly, i didn't want to. i soon forgot that i had ever  thought about leaving in the first place. besides, the rocky ground felt as soft as my bed does. i felt something crawl across my hand but i didn't care. i thought about all my problems and 'solved' them with this newfound sense of clarity. everything was good in the world. the sounds of the night animals only added to the peacefulness and the breeze felt heavenly. i soon forced myself to rise and when i looked around, i forgot that i had laid down in this particular area of my yard. as i began to walk back to my house i couldn't help but laugh at nothing. i forget that i had ever laid down in the first place. everything felt ages ago. i don't know how long i was out there, minutes? hours? i went into my room and sprawled out on my couch to watch a movie. wow, i never noticed how good this soundtrack was or how everything about this movie was perfect.

i soon felt a sense of boredom (apathy) and lethargy but i just didn't care. i went to bed feeling like an enlightened man. when i woke up the next morning i felt extremely tired. this may have been an after effect of the poppies or just because i stayed up so late. i dunno. but what i do know is that california star trips are AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! like a cross between opium, vicodin and weed (i got the munchies). peace out.</bodytext></report>
