One night I got pretty bored when my friend spent the night. We had acquired 3 5/500 mg. tablets of Lorcet earlier that week, so I decided it would be the time to try them out. Know that my parents are EXTREMELY STRICT, and say I had a sip of alcohol I'd be grounded a month. Getting caught with what I was doing that night would probably mean grounded for life. Those kind of parents. Well, lets just say hydrocodone makes you feel AWESOME, but if my parents had woken up, I would've been able to act perfectly normal and not rouse any suspicions at all.

Ok, here we go with the story. At about 1:00 A.M., I decided to go ahead and take all the pills at once with a glass of water. I was already slightly sleepy, so I'm sure I didn't get as great of an experience as I could have. If you want the best possible, take them while you are wide awake. About 1:30, I started feeling extremely happy. Thats the best way to put it, I was just in a really good mood. I am normally very overanalytical and pessimistic, so I usually talk about deep topics. My conversation with my friend tended to be less serious and depressed, but more on relevant things with me being very optimistic. I remember everything that happened, but with the combination of me being sleepy and being in a completely great mood, time passed without me realizing it. At 2:30, I was still chatting away and I had some major revelations about what I should do with my life. I was lightheaded in feeling, but when I tried to sit up, it felt like my head was a lot heavier than normal. Struggling to stay awake at about 3:00, I was caught up in forcing my eyes open and just feeling absolutely carefree.

There were absolutely no downsides to this drug, which scares me. I will definitely do them again, but just a day or two after this experience I wanted to do them again. Its that addicting. If I could live with this high I got and never feel anything else, I would. I can see how so many people get addicted to it. I smoked for almost a year and quit cold turkey, but I think it would take a lot more to get me to stop taking these pills if I ever get hooked.</bodytext></report>
