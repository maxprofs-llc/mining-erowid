Wow what a wonderful high I tell myself as I take my first 30 mg of hydrocodone in the A.M.  It no longer sedates me but rather acts as speed without the side effects.  Within two hours I am looking for the same euphoria again so I take two more 10 mg. hydrocodones but I can't seem to reach the same high.  By evening my mood swings are so severe from the massive amounts of drugs that I go into a panic.  I relieve the panic with high doses of valium and sometimes alcohol.  Now I am so confused and scared I cry myself to sleep with more valium.  I awake in the morning to start the whole pattern again.  I get to enjoy about two hours out of the 24 hour day.  I am an addict, I am dying.  I know that getting and chasing that high is wonderful.  I know that being young and experimenting is fun.  I wish I had a second chance.</bodytext></report>
