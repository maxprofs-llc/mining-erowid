I've been using E since the summer of my freshman year, I have rolled about 26 times up to this point. I'm now 18 years old and close to graduating and attending a local college. I bought a pill tester off of the and verified that these pills contained some form of MDXX, the purity however couldn't be determined. There were 8 of us, 1 would be drinking, I would take 2 rolls and some Xanax after the comedown, the rest would be on E with a combination of weed, x10 extract of salvia, and 2 grams of mushrooms.

This wasn't the most profound roll of my life, but it was a very good vibe and we all felt comfortable at my house which is in a rural location with lots of trees and open fields to roam about in. I find a natural setting is the best place to be when rolling, the sense of being part of humanity is so much greater than being at a rave. As the onset came, I felt the usual tingling sensation on my skin, which gradually led to a warm and comforting euphoria and openness I can't normally achieve sober. All my fears and anxieties were stripped away, I felt connected with everything around me, and found a serenity and peace I've come to know with each roll.

My friends were tripping pretty hard, they compared it to 2c-e only with a greater euphoria. One was communicating with what he thought were spirits in my backyard. He was so sure of himself that they were real and explained their significance and that they weren't any sort of hallucination. He handled his trip really well, and told me he could see a halo around the area we were sitting. Another one of my friends felt my parrot was talking to him every time he had his back turned, it wasn't a verbal communication of any kind but by this time I was concentrating on the person drinking next to me.

I went out with this girl for nearly 3 years, it took me a whole year of emotional and physical energy to get over our breakup. The E brought back feelings that were dormant, feelings that I preferred remain buried and gone. I had her next to me the entire night, holding her, and talking to her with an articulateness I can't usually pull off. I had my head next to hers, and every time I breathed in, it filled me with energy, euphoria ,and a familiar calm and conviction that everything was okay. When she left at 7 in the morning, I was overcome with a strong hangover and slight depression, my after glow was destroyed.

I'm back to normal, confused about my feelings, because sometimes E can be a little deceptive and hard to figure out. Were those feelings genuine, or was it a byproduct of my 'loved up' state? I still have to figure that out and while E helps to sort out alot of my problems in an unclouded mindset, this time it brought on a few complications.</bodytext></report>
