This is really a corrollary to Jetsam's 2C-T-7 report (see /n), an experience for which I served as a sitter. I'm writing it because I observed very carefully her physiological response during the first 30 to 40 minutes and noted what I believe to be predictable patterns, for the same timing has held for myself and others I've witnessed.

I weighed out 7mg of powder for Jetsam which she split between both nostrils. The burn hit her hard. Following is a minute-by-minute account of my observations of her condition:

At 3 minutes she was flushed, perspiring, and her eyes were well dilated. It was obviously quite an intense coming up.
/n
/n
At 5 minutes she began having muscle tremors. She seemed to plateau at this point for a minute or two.
/n
/n
At 8 minutes she began showing signs of real discomfort. She curled up into a ball and asked that I hold her hand. I took her pulse; it was faint and accellerated.

Between the 9th and 10th minute was her first indication of any nausea. She asked for water. I began to get a little concerned, for Jetsam is a highly experienced psychonaut who's handled a *lot* of hairy situations and here she was having what appeared to be a particularly difficult time of it. I was extremely relieved having done nothing myself so that I could monitor her progress.

By the 11 minute point, she was visibly wincing and having muscle contractions, predominantly in her legs (from outward appearances).

By 15 minutes, she was full bore into the experience and was clearly having difficulty assessing her situation. I helped her into the bathroom after she indicated she was feeling the need to vomit.
/n
/n
At 18 minutes she had a massive purge. I've seen Jetsam vomit plenty, but this was more than I'd ever seen her expel. The duration of each expulsion worried me -- fluid would flow for 1-3 seconds. I immediately recognized the serious possibility of asphyxiation from such prolific puke. /n

By 25 minutes, things were settling in. Once things leveled out, we had a great time. You can read her report for the rest of the story.</bodytext></report>
