I read about how flavones in plants like skullcap act like benzodiazepines and thought I'd give it a try. I prepared skullcap tea by adding about 400ml hot but not boiling water to 4tbs of shredded Scutellaria lateriflora letting steep about 10min then straining.

After about a half hour I noticed definite CNS depression, a sort of quieting of the brain, no euphoria or anything I'd really call recreational, just sort of a blank mind feeling, made it easier to sleep but didn't exactly knock me out either. All in all I would recommend it as a sleep aid but that's about it. Woke up the next morning without any real 'hangover'.</bodytext></report>
