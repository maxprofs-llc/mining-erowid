After several tests, I have raised the normal germination rate of Jurema Prema seeds from 10% to well over 80%.

Place several dozen seeds in a shatter-proof saucer. Do NOT scarify. Cover with a thin layer of water. Boil water in a kettle, allow steam to pass, and add super hot water to seed dish to raise water level four fold. Let seeds sit in this hot water for two minutes. Then double water amount with cold water and let seeds sit for 24 hours in normal light at room temperature. Change cool water daily and check for swollen seeds, which are now beginning to sprout. Leave seeds in water until white rootlet breaks through, usually another 24 hours.

Plant in a four-inch pot, bottom half with potting mix, top half with perlite or vermiculite, and plant seeds just below top surface. Keep moist but not drenched. Prefers warmth and light. Third leaf with clear mimosa-like leaf structure should appear within one week.</bodytext></report>
