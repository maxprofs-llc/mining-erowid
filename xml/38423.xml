I just wanted to inform you of my personal experience with AMT that left me hospitalized for the entire trip.  In 2002 I purchased 1 gram of AMT from the internet.  This was not the first time I had ingested it. After reading about the dangers of the sensitive dosages, I was always careful to measure safe amounts out.  However, on this particular evening I did not.  I was careless and thought that I could 'eye ball' it.  I put some AMT into a capsule and ingested it.  I then drove to my boyfriend's apartment and hung out for awhile.

Probably an hour and a half later I started getting slight visuals and then all of a sudden out of nowhere I lost my mind.  I cannot explain exactly what happened... but I was confused.... I didn't know how to talk or even who I was...  I cannot explain what happened... but everything started spinning out of control and my boyfriend called my parents to the apartment....  The took me to the emergency room and I was given activated charcoal and spent the night and morning tripping in the emergency room.  When I stared to realize I was just tripping and I knew who I was, it was actual quite fun.  But I did scare everyone around me.</bodytext></report>
