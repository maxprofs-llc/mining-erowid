My girlfriend and I finally decided to try the seeds after I had read much about them on the internet.  I have eaten mushrooms numerous times, and I have also tripped on acid.  Both my mushroom and acid experiences have ranged from pretty bad to excellent.  I fully understand that it is the nature of psychedelic drugs like these to have unpredictable effects.  Sometimes they are awesome, and sometimes you think you're gonna die.

I soaked 16 seeds in water for a day or so, and then spent a good amount of time scraping the 'skin' off of them with my fingernails.  I then soaked them again for another day, and scraped them once again.  I had heard that the 'skin' is the primary reason that people get sick when they consume these seeds, so I figured I'd be as safe as possible.  The seeds were sold as 100% organic, so presumably there were never any pesticides applied to the plants during their growth period.

In any event, once the seeds were fully scraped, I ground 8 of them in a coffee grinder and dumped the powder into a container of water and let it sit for a few hours, shaking it up now and then.  I did the same thing with the remaining 8 seeds, but used a different container so that my girlfriend and I could be sure to have the exact same dose.  She is about 130 pounds, and I weigh about 150.  We both drank our slurries at the same time, but it only took about a half hour before she threw up.  My stomach was feeling pretty crappy, and although I wanted to throw up, I didn't.  Fortunately for her, vomiting got most of the seeds out of her body before she had a chance to digest them.

We took a walk and things started to get interesting.  My stomach felt pretty crappy, but I was still excited for the trip to come.  It didn't take too long before I felt horrible.  I tripped my balls off and had what I would describe as the worst 12 hours of my life.  There were some VERY weird side effects of the seeds that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

I tripped hard, but not in a good way-- it was a totally bad trip.  One of the interesting things about hallucinogenics like LSD, shrooms, and LSA is that even though I know you just ate a drug, sometimes I cannot help but feel that I am going to be fucked up forever.  No matter how many times I told myself that it was going to get better, deep down I was never really sure.  My girlfriend helped to reassure me that eventually I would be okay, but it was a very difficult experience.

Physically I felt sick to my stomach, and visually everything was wacky.  The visual wackiness was typical of what you might expect from acid or shrooms, but not enjoyable at all.  It just made things more difficult.  At times I felt halfway between sleeping and waking despite the fact that I wasn't even close to being asleep.  I couldn't stay in one place for too long without growing extremely uncomfortable, so I had to go outside for a little while, then come back inside, then go back outside etc.

One of the strangest things for me was a definitive cyclic nature of the drug.  I truly believe that this was a strictly physical thing, and not mental at all.  What would happen is I would feel really bad for a while, and then gradually I would start to feel more normal, but then I would start to feel bad again, and then I would start to feel more normal.  The first time that I started to feel more normal, I got excited because I almost started to feel good for the first time.

The weirdest thing of all was the physical effects that would go along with the cycles of feeling good and then bad.  While I was feeling 'bad' my hands felt very uncomfortable and tingly.  Then gradually I would start feeling better, and my hands would not tingle again.  Soon though my hands would start to get tingly and I could feel the 'badness' coming back, as if I could literally feel the drug pulsing through my veins.  Also very strange was the fact that I literally could not have a conversation during the 'bad' parts, but during the times when I felt more normal, my entire mental state shifted such that I could have a normal conversation with various friends who were around the house at the time.  But like clockwork, I would begin to feel my hands get numb and tingly, and I would start to lose my verbal ability, until I had to leave to go outside and do my best to make it through the next hour of uncomfortableness.

These cycles continued for the duration of the 'trip,' which, incidentally was a full 12 hours.  At almost exactly 12 hours after we ate the seeds was the first time that I felt normal again, and it was an unbelieveably emotional experience for me because I had had such a harrowing experience for such a long time.  The cycles of 'goodness' and 'badness' got progressively shorter and progressively milder-- what I mean is that the 'bad' parts were worse and longer lasting during the first hours after ingesting the seeds, but became gradually more tolerable and shorter lasting as the trip progressed.

I would put the entire experience in a category as the quintessential 'bad trip.'  This was not only mentally and emotionally difficult for me, but physically, it was extremely uncomfortable.  During the 'bad' periods, I felt sick to my stomach, tingly and numb in my extremities, and I felt on the verge of a yawn for the entire time.

To anyone who's thinking about eating these seeds I would say this... there is probably a reason that these seeds are not well known.  I think people aren't too familiar with them because they are not popular.  They are not popular because they are not enjoyable for the most part.  I could see how in some instances some people might have enjoyed consuming these seeds, but my guess is that you're much more likely to have a bad time than a good time.  This is coming from someone who's had plenty of mushroom and acid experiences.  My worst mushroom and acid experiences sucked in their own rights, but the suckiness was something that I could deal with as an experienced drug user.  However, the suckiness of the LSA seeds put me over the edge, beyond what I think any mentally stable, normal person could effectively and comfortably deal with.</bodytext></report>
