I have tried a fair few drugs (MDMA, speed, numerous different ecstasy pills, weed, 2C-I, 2C-B, foxy, coke, ketamine, codeine, acid, DMT (accidentally) etc) and have always looked online to see other peoples experiences, although Ive never posted my own. But after trying  4-AcO-DMT last weekend, I feel I have to tell the world about possibly the best experience of my life.

I arrived at my boyfriends (Adam) house at 11pm, 3 of his housemates who were in the living room had already taken it (not sure how long before I got there, possibly an hour) and offered us some. They said it was quite mild, and much like a synthetic version of mushrooms (a drug which I have not had much experience of) They where all saying what a fantastic drug it was and how it didnt give the headfuck like mushrooms sometimes can. After a bit of hesitation Adam and me decided to take it, and his housemate gave us each a dose of 15mg. We put the powder into a rizila bomb and swallowed it.

Note: I have a very slow metabolism, I would say It usually takes me around 30-45mins to start feeling the full effects of a pill or a bomb of MDMA, compared to Adam who starts feeling it after around 15-20min.

11.30pm (+0.30) Neither of us really felt anything much (we even talked about going to bed as we where both quite tired!) but we sat and chatted/listened to music with the other housemates for a while.

12.00am (+1.00)..only had very mild increase in brightness of objects, the blinds in the living room appeared to be swaying. I noticed that glass and plastic objects seemed to be a bit shinier than unusual. Start to see tracings of objects, like if people move their arms, or if I look at something then look away I can still see it. Still very mild, quite unimpressed and said to Adam would be better if it was about twice as strong.

1am (+2.00)..feeling the effects more now, noticed my body feels quite heavy and very slightly rushy. Like a weak pill. Nice feeling, not a huge increase in visuals everythings a bit brighter and a little fuzzy round the edges, the flame of a candle is very interesting to look at. Didnt expect it to get any better than this because of how long it has taken to come up.quite disappointed but still feeling very nice and quite euphoric/happy.

2am (+3.00).. all of a sudden it seems to kick in, and starts getting more intense, stronger visuals starting with the window blinds moving/swaying more intensely and am having trouble focusing on anything. Things are much brighter/glowing. Still have lovely body feeling of heaviness but my mind is perfectly clear and I am having no trouble thinking/talking/communicating.

2.15am (+3.15).. visuals are quite intense, things appear to be melting/glowing. Between now and 3.30am visuals continue getting slowly stronger, more glowing of objects, things start changing colour and appear to be melting. Have a completely clear memory, there seems to be no loss of co-ordination or ability to think. Feels amazing to walk/move, like Im pushing against the air at quite a force. I am finding everything very funny I got into hysterical fits of laughter on a few occasions.

3.30am (+4.30). start to get a bit freaked out by the hallucinations. I had a extremely bad acid come down a while ago and the hallucinations now are very strong, which remind me of the acid, try to look at my friends but I find their faces quite distressing, they are melting! I start to question if I will ever be normal again (I dont have a good grip on reality as it is) I start to freak out a bit, I tell Adam Im not having a good time, I go upstairs and take a 5HTP tablet (which Im hoping will sober me up a little bit) and go into the bathroom., I get myself a little worked up and panicked, just because I am overwhelmed with what Im seeing. When I close my eyes I cant get away from the hallucinations, in fact they seem to be stronger. My friend gives me a valium (think it was 10mg) and I decide to go to bed, Adam joins me too, as we are both feeling quite tired. Also take 3x ibuprofen/codeine tablets I have (I love codeine, I was hoping it would make me feel a bit better, couldnt extract it so just took 38.4mg)

 4am (+5)..am in bed, the Valium and codeine kicks in. I FEEL AMAZING. Im lying in bed listening to Zero 7, looking at the most beautiful visuals I have ever seen, they are still very strong, although more abstract. All I can see is beautiful geometric patterns swirling in time to the music, everything I can see (the room is semi dark) seems to have this purple and green glowing outline. I cannot even describe in words how beautiful this is. Adam is asleep, and I lie in bed until around 6.30am (around the time I fall asleep). I cant stop slowly waving my hands in front of my face, the tracings look so amazing. The combination was just amazing. I have never felt so happy/euphoric in my life. I am so calm and content with everything in my life. (and I have done MDMA many times, this euphoria is 100X more intense than that feeling). I start to think about things Ive been worrying about, but nothing matters. Everything I can see just looks so beautiful I cant describe. I force myself to stay awake as long as possible, because I dont want to fall asleep and stop feeling like this. I remember lying there thinking this is the best I have ever felt for 2 and a half hours.

When I wake up in the morning I feel totally enlightened. I am so unbelievably happy and feel lucky that I have had the most positive experience of my life. That night honestly changed me as a person, I feel so lucky to be alive and everything just seems so much more precious to me now.</bodytext></report>
