Upon arriving at my friends studio apartment we prepared 50 grams of powdered p.viridis leaf via the lemon juice method.  Approximately four grams of crushed harmala seeds were ingested by each of us in capsules.  After straining the leaf material the liquid was put back on the boiler until it reached a lower level (three ice cubes frozen).  After freezing the ice got smashed and eaten as a kind of disgusting slushy.  I would recommend this method because neither of us got nauseous during our experiences and have both gotten sick on smaller liquid doses.  This effect is probably due to the lower volume. Also, eating the slush is much easier to stomach.

I felt the first effects after about twenty minutes.  Ten minutes later I was nearing the peak, I felt as though I was hanging over a chasm with no bottom.  With my minds eye I brought the cascading patterns within my grasp.  Clearing away those visuals floating on the surface of my perception I dug deeper, only to reveal even more incredible patterns, rich with psychic content.  I knew I was at the peak even though it was not nearly as intense as a previous liquid dose at the same level (the extra boiling may destroy some of the necessary elements of ayahuasca but when you get it for five dollars for fifty grams its worth a little extra to avoid the vomiting and later intestinal cramping trust me).

My head reeling as I sat up I reached for the pre-packed bong of salvia 10X.  The following minutes of my experience are why I wrote this report (my first).  After one bowl-clearing hit I held my breath, within seconds I had faded from all that is familiar (nothing new yet).  Then I went further than I ever have before.  The space in front of me folded open and enveloped the world.  I have had fully immersed salvia experiences before (becoming one or more other worldly entities at once, alien thoughts, etc.) but this was different.  It was like I had slipped through a crack in the world, I had broken a rule.  The closest state to it I have ever experienced was when I was a young child, struggling with where the woman went who the magician made disappear.  I could not pass it off as a trick, so as children do (at least I did) I created a world to explain it that had nothing to do with this one, that way the woman would really disappear from this world, our world of 1-5 to the other of 6+ (no intended quantitative difference).

In this new world there are more than 360 degrees, in fact you can spin forever and never come back to your starting point.  I felt I had reached this world by perceiving at impossible angles.  I did see these angles with clarity (a product of the ayahuasca no doubt) but their impossible attributes were felt with a sense unlike any I have experienced, and that I certainly cant describe.  For about five minutes I was and was a part of the 'impossible'.  I was told I had been vocalizing during the experience whatis what who are youwhat..no and other nonsensical ramblings that I feel have no real relationship with the experience (as Ill explain later).  The thing that I feel that is important about this experience is that (as I understand it) it could be the way a mind evolved entirely in three dimensions would represent other actually existing dimensions.

I am perfectly aware of overreactions to psychedelic experiences and their propensity for planting irrational ideas in peoples heads (Im a damn psyche major make of that what you will), but it is because of the attributes of the experience and its separation from other experiences Ive had with the same drugs that I even suggest its reality.  Also the vocalizations I made that Ive stated had no relationship with the experience (I did not feel I met anyone to ask who are you and I usually do not vocalize at all during similar experiences) suggest an extinction burst characteristic of a psychically lost individual.  When a complex organism no longer receives reinforcement (in this case participation in the three-dimensional worldmaybe) it will exhibit behaviors that in the past have received that missing reinforcement (to understand we ask questions).  When the organism does not receive reinforcement it will basically throw a tantrum where novel behaviors sometimes appear (asking questions in machine gun fashion with no relevance to the situation).

After sitting stunned for about thirty minutes after the experience was over, I felt I should eat, ten minutes after that I began to trip on ayahuasca again (dmt emptied from the gallbladder?).  I strapped on my headphones and listened to number six on Sigur Ross American release album (both titles are in Icelandic and I do not recall them).  I had just had an experience that I thought was impossible to have as a human and beatific visions were riding ethereal melodies up my throat.  I cried from intense happiness, overwhelming awe, and the most sincere gratification to be part of this infinite world.

In case people actually read this report, Id like to take this opportunity to ask Erowid readers to boycott companies that sell ayahuasca related plants and salvia as natural highs.  Ayahuasca and salvia are some of the most truly important psychedelics and it would be nice to have them around so please let these companies know how you feel.  Expand your mind and drag the world kicking and screaming with you.</bodytext></report>
