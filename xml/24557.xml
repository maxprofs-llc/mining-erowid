Well one night I had drank quite a bit, and woke up with a horrible hangover...I had tried things like advil and other OTC painkillers to no avail, so someone I was talking to online suggested taking vitamin C.

Well I know I didn't have any laying around, so I checked in my father's medicine cabnet and fortunatly found some.  They were huge ass pills though, but I was in quite a bit of pain so I said 'what the hell' and just took it.

About half and hour later I noticed the intensity of the hangover diminishing, and with ten minutes of that it was gone completely.  So from that point on whenever hungover I have taken it with complete success.  I am not exactly sure how it works, but I know that vitamin C helps to boost my immune sysetem so I am sure that is a big part of it, okay, good luck to you all and all that jazz...</bodytext></report>
