I had just bought a Volcano vaporizer and wanted to test it out to make sure everything worked correctly.  Lacking cannabis, I found some lavender flowers I had picked and dried earlier that summer.  I ground them up in the grinder and loaded them into the vaporization chamber and turned the heat on low.  I filled a large (5+L) bag up with the whitish mist and drew some into my lungs.  The taste was pungent, but not overly so.  I continued to inhale and exhale the mist until the entire bag was empty.

After about five minutes, I began to feel very calm and collected.  I was comfortable with what was going on in my world.  I had a definite tendency to smile more, and my lungs and sinuses felt very clear and open.  I felt relaxed and awake.  After about 10 minutes, this feeling passed, but the calmness stays.  The Volcano manual suggested lavender as an aromatherapeautic for vaporization.  It worked well.  I think it would feel great when sick or congested as well.</bodytext></report>
