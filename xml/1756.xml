I was the sober person for a Amanita Muscaria experience with some friends. They consumed some fresh mushrooms with peanut butter, as the taste was horrid. Nothing happened for a while. Then...they all ended up getting sick (vomitting). The illness was brief but violent and unexpected. That passed and the buzz set in. They described it as similar to a few beers. Nothing special, and certainly not worth the experience.

They have not done it since and I don't think they will.

Based on their experience, I would not recommend it. If you do try it, be careful.</bodytext></report>
