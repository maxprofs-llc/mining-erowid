Well, I have been reading up on  Amanitas - A. muscaria  for a while. Finally ordered an ounce. I have taken Acid, never shrooms of any sort. So I ordered an ounce of 'grade a' I had a friend come over that is very familiar with regular shrooms that you pick off manure. He made the tea.

7:30pm he let the water boil. Soon as is began to boil he cut the temp. back until it was no longer boiling and dropped in the shrooms.

We are going to boil the rest of the ounce tonite. and report back. hopefully i will be able to tell you about a mind blowing trip tomorrow. Or.. I will just get some Acid and take a couple hits</bodytext></report>
