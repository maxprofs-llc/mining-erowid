I swallowed 25 mg's of oxycodone at 7:30. At 9 o'clock I was feeling euphoric and in the mood to write how I felt. Extreme beauty and the feeling that everything was getting better swarmed around me. I was also taking Effexor 150 mg's and Risperdal .5mg's daily for my depression. I also smoked two black and mild cigars while writing. Here is what I wrote..
/n
/n
Warm waves slip into my heart,
/n
My eyes close and enter sweet slumber.
/n
Smoke rises from a joy-filled plain.
/n
The cold of the night doesn't enter me,
/n
Yet gains awareness that I don't grasp for it.
/n
Fuzzy cottonballs replace my bone.
/n
They cozily fit together to form my body.
/n
The starless night still seems bright,
/n
Unevading and calm the moon does appear.
/n
No news could change my state of mind.
/n
The moon then creates a spotlight on me.
/n
Everything working for me is ten times as clear,
/n
And the negative things cease to exist.
/n
Time drives by in bundles as I smile.
/n
Lights gain a mysterious glow.
/n
My limbs move in a warm fire of hope.
/n
Yet my skin stays in a radiant way.
/n
Clear are my thoughts and ambitions.
/n
My eyes are starlit as if another universe is inside me,
/n
With only good to let the planets revolve.
/n

Towards the end of the experience, I felt better about myself. As if my current depression had been swept away. All and all, I had a very pleasant time. It was the best Halloween of my life..</bodytext></report>
