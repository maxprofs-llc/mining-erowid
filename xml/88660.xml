We tried some JWH-122 in powder form applied on mullein.  One bowl 0.07 grams smoked once among three SWIMs and paused.  After 2 to 5 minutes we began feeling high.  Soon after we all agreed that this is a pleasant, functional, mellow buzz.  Actually, quite stoned.  At the time of this writing,  one hour has passed and we are still quite pleasant.  Average dose per pound of body weight is .0001 gram.  Advise not to exceed.</bodytext></report>
