Well I woke up one morning and got ready for school. Lately things have been going good but I want to make them better. So I dug through the med. trey. Had alot of stuff but Phentermine just stood out. And the do not consume with alchohal caught my attention. I looked on the internet and found it was a appitite surpresser. I like my weight but, I wanted a high. So I grabbed afew pills and went to school.

T:0:50 Woooo omg I feel like I'm on cocaine.(without the energy bursts) I'm sitting in my chair just enjoying everything and when some1 wanted me to talk I would take FEW moment and then speak because I didnt want to talk I wAnted to enjoy this awesome feeling. As the day Progressed I kept feeling better. Got to gym class......and what amistake. I felt like playing basketball so I started sweating alot.....I mean ALOT! I got tired withing minutes and had to sit down.(I now think that the phent. made me dehydrated) So I went to the water fountain to get rehydrated......ULGH!! Tastes so bad. I guess the appetite surpressing is working. But I managed to gulp quiet a bit down.Still feeling like I just got 50 free dodge vipers(cause thats what the feelings like is almost overwhelming)I went to lunch coudnt eat so I just went to go get some water cause at this time I had some serious cottonmouth.
