I smoked a joint that a friend gave me that had been laced with PCP (unbeknownst by me or my friend). Later he told me that his supplier was upset with him because he hadn't paid for grass that my friend had been given in an earlier deal, so his supplier got even by lacing his next supply with 'Angel Dust'.

Anyway, I smoked the joint (I was a fairly inexperienced pot smoker) and began to think that what I was beginning to experience wasn't a 'normal' marijuana high. I was becoming very anxious and uncomfortable. I tried watching TV with my roommates but found that I was becoming more anxious by the minute, as well as feeling nausious and chilled. I excused myself to bed, (around 11 p.m.) hoping to 'sleep off' the effects.

Lying in bed, I was feeling the typical effects of the pot, but began to experience a pressure at the base of my spine that shot my spine and seemed to explode in my head; then the sensation would repeat over and over. I could feel my heart racing. I felt like I was going to be sick, so I went into the bathroom. At that point I looked into the bathroom mirror. I was shocked with my appearance. All the color was gone from my skin and my eyes had black circles. I looked like a corpse! I stumbled out to where my roommates were still watching TV. They immediately knew something was wrong. I begged them to take me to the emergency room. They were reluctant because they were afraid that they would get into trouble (they were pretty heavy pot smokers and thought that if they took me to the hospital that the police would get involved). I told them that if they didn't take me that I was going anyway. They had to help me out to the car. I lay in the back seat all the way there, still experiencing the explosions in my head and my racing heart beat.

In the reception area I was given a form to fill out once I confessed to my condition. I couldn't read the form, my sight was blurred, so I gave my insurance card and the form to one of my friends to deal with. Within a few minutes I was thrown on a gurney and taken into the emergency room. At that point I was on the gurney with those hospital curtains surrounding me. I was violently shaking and really beginning to worry. A doctor (or intern, for all I know) asked me what I had taken and to describe my symptoms, which I did as best as I could. He left, and a nurse returned immediately after and gave me a pill and a small cup of water. After what seemed about a half an hour, I began to feel a little better. My heart beat had returned to normal and the shooting sensations had stopped. I was still trembling, though. By now it was well after 1 a.m. After about another fifteen minutes, I decided to get up. I looked out of the curtains and called out to find out when I would be released. No one was around. I noticed a side door that was an exit to the parking lot, and went out that door. I went around to the main entrance to the emergency room. My friends were waiting there for me. I said to them, 'Let's get the hell out of here'.

I guess my friend didn't fill out the form correctly, because my insurance was never billed! It took two full days for the shaking to stop. I became so paranoid from the experience that every time I smelled pot, I feel that I was going to relive the experience. That was the last time I used any drug besides alcohol.</bodytext></report>
