I've been prescibed Pain Killers and Stimulants for the past couple of years...
/n
I've always had fun with Percocet and Ritalin Together...It is one hell of a Speed-Ball. But I digress...

I asked my Doctor for a prescription for Ultram, which he gladly filled. I decided that night to try Speed-Balling with the Ultram and Ritalin -- Big Mistake. Within one hour of taking the 10 ultram tablets and 3 ritalin, I remember standing up to change the channel of the TV, and the next thing I knew, I had Doctors and Nurses standing all around me. I though 'WHAT THE F*CK IS GOING ON?!?!?!?'

It turns out that after standing up to fiddle with the TV, I suddenly fell over and went into a grand-mal seizure from what I am told. Since that night, My left hand's Dexterity and Manuverability has been severly impaired. (Good thing I'm right Handed, Right?) I am told that since the seizure lasted about 6 minutes, Oxygen flow was impaired in the part of my brain that controls my left hand and arm for too long -- Dain Bramage errr... I mean Brain Damage.

BE aware of drugs you mix that lower the seizure thresh-hold... You just might end up a vegetable.</bodytext></report>
