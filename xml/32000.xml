Just a quick note to contribute my experience with this substance which spans over a year now.  I do not have an addiction and while I enjoy the pleasant effects of alcohol and other items, I never feel any withdrawal or cravings.

Here's what I have observed:
/n
/n
First effects: About T+20 minutes.
/n
Full effects:  About T+60 minutes.
/n
/n
Daytime usage: OK.  Able to function just fine.
/n
/n
Evening usage: Very pleasant. Relaxed. Well-being. Comfortable. Great for web-surfing, reading, listening to music.
/n
/n
Night usage:   My most frequent usage.  I believe usage makes it more difficult to fall asleep. I do feel very relaxed and pleasant while I trying though.  Once I fall asleep, I tend to wake often.  While this usually bothers the hell out of me, I feel absolutely wonderful when this happens on Ultram.  Euphoric, relaxed, slight fingertip numbness.

Aftereffects:  Even if I had trouble falling asleep or awoke several times during the night, I rise feeling great, relaxed, and well rested.

/n
Side Effects:  Slight but noticeably increased itching.
/n
/n
Overall:      A really pleasant, relaxing experience with little or no downside and no withdrawal or addiction danger (at least with me).

Other:  I tried to experiment by adding a Soma to the mix and found the experience to be very satisfactory.  Helps reduce the tendency to lie awake when first retiring.</bodytext></report>
