Subject is generally healthy 115 lb. male with moderate metabolism and no current tolerance to serotongenic compounds.

T+0h: 10 mg of 2-CB-Fly is ingested orally on an empty stomach.
/n
/n
T+1h: Mild stimulatory and entactogenic are effects are noticed, as well as some mild nausea. Slight CEV's are noted.
/n
/n
T+1.5h: Slight ego loss is apparent, mild synesthesia also noted. OEV's are extremely mild, much less hallucinogenic than 2-CE; however, the body component is highly pronounced.
/n
/n
T+4h: Body component loses its 'warmth', leaving a 'lossier' bodyload than I would find typical of 2-Cx's. Sexual enhancement is non-existant, in fact, every attempt at gratification is abruptly halted by the distraction of something completely non-sexual in nature. No vascular constriction is noticed, and vascular dysfunction normally felt even in sobriety has now dissipiated altogether, long after the effects of the drug have worn off.
/n
/n
T+8h: Baseline. A gentle crash, I found sleep quite easily.

Overall 2-CB-FLY is an enjoyable material, and while not Earth-shatteringly awe-inspiring, could definitely pose as an excellent intermediary to truely psychedelic compounds like LSD or 2-CE.</bodytext></report>
