The night started out young. I was bored and home alone from 8pm till about 3:30am. What else was there to do? I had some untaken extra-strength Nodoz laying around in my room, so I thought 'ah, I might as well as finish this bottle out'. Big mistake.

I take 5 extra strength pills (200mg/pill) in all of about 15 seconds. downed them all with a glass of water thinking 'this will be fun, I'll feel all energetic!' wrong.

Sure, at first I started out all hyper and enthusiastic, but it didnt last long.

By now, I'm all out sweating, trying desperately to catch my breath, my heart is pounding out of my chest, I could have sworn I was going to pass out at any moment and die. I could do nothing but pace my house, even though the walls seemed to sway from side to side while I attempted to walk back to the toilet for the maybe 15th time in 30 minutes.

Just when I think that nothing could get any worse, The caffeine seems to jump to a higher level. Keep in mind that although 1000mg's isn't a fatal overdose, I'm a very VERY small person to have taken all of that in one swallow. So by now I can't walk around my house because things are getting too intense for me. The only thing I can remember thinking is 'I will never touch caffeine again.'

I somehow manage to get to the phone in my kitchen and dial the operator to connect me to poison control. I get a hold of them and to my surprise they tell me that 'I'll be fine, my amount taken was not an overdose that needed Medical attention.' They told me I just needed to fair through it till it passed. Around 3:00 am I either passed out of fell asleep in my room.

Right now its 9:45 AM, and I woke up still feeling like shit, my stomach is killing me, I can't believe this. I will never touch Caffeine again in my life.</bodytext></report>
