I was trying to find some info on using 5-HTP with LSD, but I didn't come across too much good info.  I tried it this past weekend and have decided to post my report.  I had heard that in combination with 5-HTP, it gives the LSD trip a bit more of an MDMA feel.  Here are my findings.

8pm Dosed 100mg of 5-HTP

9pm Dosed 2.5 hits of average quality LSD.

9:45pm I am feeling the mild calming effects of the 5-HTP when the LSD starts to kick in.  I'm feeling the typical anxiety I always get with LSD, but it doesn't seem as bad as usual.  No real MDMA type feeling though.  Just less anxiety.  Maybe my touch was a little more sensitive.  I chilled out with my gf (who was also doing LSD and pot).  I didn't smoke any pot though because I don't deal so well with it.  Watched some dance videos on BPM for a while.  Then put on some soft porn since we were both pretty arroused.  Fooled around a bit, couldn't concentrate too much on the sex though due to the acid.  Listened to some tunes and watched some winamp visualizations on my big tv.  I was getting some pretty sweet audio distortions.  Was feeling the music in waves go through me.  Got some decent color trails, but nothing spectacular.  One thing I noticed was that it was a total positive vibe from start to finish.  I attribute this to the 5-HTP.

Around 1am, I took another 100mg of 5-HTP for the ride down.  I was getting a bit edgy just before I took it and in about 15 minutes, I was nice and relaxed for the comedown.  Not edgy 'stone skin' type feeling.  It was a total warm and fuzzy comedown.  I was able to sleep by about 5am.  That is the earliest I have ever gotten to sleep after an acid trip.  The 5-HTP didn't shorten the trip or anything, it just enabled me to relax during the comedown and I didn't have to sit awake through the whole 7:45...7:44...7:45 thing.  The most annoying part of LSD is when I am just tired of tripping and want to go to sleep, but can't!  The 5-HTP really helped this.  I also had a shot of vodka around 4am, but it usually takes about 4-6 shots to really get me to calm down enough to even think about sleep.

Also, just a note.  I don't feel that the first dose of 5-HTP gave me any MDMA type feeling in combination with the LSD.  If anything it kept me calm while I was taking off.  I probably wouldn't bother with it before the LSD in the future, but definitely for the comedown.  Happy travels!</bodytext></report>
