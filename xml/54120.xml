Whenever I'm about to try a new drug I always check online first to see what to look out for and check if it's particularly dangerous, so with this in mind I wanted to write something about methamphetamine for first time users like I have been today. I want this to be useful for someone curious about the effects or thinking about trying it. A whole heap of entries here about meth are from people who were still buzzing when they wrote them. I wondered about this at first, but now I know why.

Some of my housemate's friends come around here every weekend and use all kinds of stuff, DXM, Ecstasy, Meth etc. I've dropped Ecstasy with them a couple of times, but hesitated about meth until today - you hear all kinds of crazy (bad crazy) stuff about it. They'd been bugging me to try it all weekend, saying it was really good stuff - they even waved their baggie of power under my nose, saying it smelt like honey. This afternoon I finally relented.

The baggie contained a faintly yellow fine powder. These guys either snort it or drink it with tea (they swear it still works in tea). They advised I snort it. They shook out two lines, about 4cm in length and 3mm in width. I snorted the first one, half in each nostril, and kept the second line until later - the guys were going off to run around or something, and I didn't want to use too much at once.

The smell/taste was kind of acrid, but not too bad - tasted like a chemical of some kind. My nose hurt for about 5 seconds and then the pain went away, I sniffed my nose for about 3 minutes to clear out the taste. I sat around and waited. In about ten minutes, I felt a sudden rush to my head, and I felt my heart quicken. Just then a good friend of mine called and asked to meet me at the mall 10 minutes away, so I walked over there. Along the way I felt very clear headed - no euphoria but a little more jittery than usual. Walking felt physically pretty good, I had funny tingles in my legs and arms. I wanted to run but didn't want to bring attention to myself. I met with my friend and told him what I'd done, and he said he was thinking of trying it too sometime. I had to resist the urge to talk at him constantly, but still found myself telling weird stories about stuff I'd forgotten ages ago.

About an hour after I snorted the first line, I returned home, not feeling it too strongly - I kept thinking 'Well, this is pretty cool, but it's speed! It's meant to be really hardcore!'. So I snorted the second line, which was bigger, 1h 5mins after the first. 7 minutes after this I felt the same rush, which has slowly got stronger and stronger. I felt the 'true' meth feeling then - an extremely acute awareness of everything happening around me, I could hear the cat scratching three rooms away. I felt a rush of euphoria, kind of similar to ecstasy, but much less fuzzy and lovey. A kind of clear headed happiness, a satisfaction that I can do whatever I want. After the second line my hands, legs and chest got extremely tingly, almost numb, but that went away within about 20-30 minutes.

The main thing I want to do on meth, is do stuff. The urge to find something, anything to occupy myself is very strong. I had the feeling that my mind was perfectly synchronised with my body. On meth it is very easy to concentrate on one task without thinking about anything else - whatever I'm doing seems like the most interesting thing in the world - I can see how this stuff would be brilliant for studying, at least better than lots of vitamin B. The high is not at all similar to Ecstasy except in that I have alot more energy. Smoking cigarettes becomes a joy. In fact just about any task becomes, if not quite fun, absolutely doable.

I've enjoyed these two lines so much that I could easily see this become my drug of choice. If there were no side effects I could do it all the f***ing time and life would be a lot buzzier and funner. But herein lies the problem - I like it too goddamn much. It seems to fit in with the usual operation of my brain like a jigsaw - just increasing its clarity and effectiveness. Even now, about 2 hours after use, I still feel my energy increasing, if that's possible.

I can see how easy it would be to get into a cycle of use of this drug. The guy who gave it to me uses it every weekend, all weekend, and has sores all over his back that he constantly picks at. The skin on his face is fucked up with acne, that I don't remember him having before he started on meth. The three of the guys haven't eaten or slept all weekend, but they've gone through a whole lot of cigarettes and chewing gum. They keep arguing with each other about nothing at all. If acne and sores were the only side effect, I can see myself trying to get my hands on as much meth as possible. But I can see now, already, after this first experience, that the sheer desirability of it is enough to make me think very carefully about trying it again (although I know I will), or any more often than once a month.</bodytext></report>
