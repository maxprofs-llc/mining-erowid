Until I ate the 5-MeO-AMT it had been 3 months since my last trip.  This wasn't by choice, rather, it was due to the lack of hallucinogens around.  I had been eating LSD 2 or 3 times a week for a steady while, and was greatly disappointed when I lost the hookup.  When I heard the news that my friend J had found some 5-MeO-AMT, I felt the excitement that only comes to me when I know I'm going to be tripping nuts shortly.    I picked up 3 doses for myself and my roommates S and D(1 each).  In the past month I've had some difficulties stemming from a situation that has made me stop smoking weed, so I felt the need to get in touch with 'reality'. The reality that I prefer at least.

S and I eat the gel cap with the 5-MeO-AMT and put on some Floyd.  We also put in Alice in Wonderland and began drinking on the 12 pack S had bought.  For some reason watching that movie always makes my come-up a little easier.  I guess because it's just so ridiculous.  D had a play to go to a little bit later so he was going to eat the cap when he got back.

J had informed me that the comeup was pretty intense, and by now I'm feeling it.  I was getting pretty bad leg cramps and an odd sensation in my neck similar to acid but not quite the same.  I tried getting up and walking but I find my legs are almost to heavy to move.

Still no visuals yet, other than some slight tracers when I wave my hand in front of my face.  Alice in Wonderland isn't doing much for me, but the music had become noticeably more intense.

The 5-MeO-AMT hit me like a ton of bricks.  I was having full fledged visuals i.e breathing walls, liquid ceilings, visual distortions and so on...

It was then that I decided I wanted some nitrous.  I had never had nitrous while tripping up to this point and while I was definitly tripping hard, I wanted it to be more intense.

S and I arrive at the local head shop without incident and I scoop up a case of nitrous.  I know driving while tripping is a bad idea, but for me it's almost like coloring inside the lines just using my mind if that makes any sense.

This stuff feels alot like acid except for the come-up and the stronger body buzz.  I'd place the trip in between mushrooms and acid in terms of the body buzz and visuals.  The only thing it's missing is the looped out feeling I get in my mind when I trip on other substances.  That is one of my favorite things about acid, as it just makes everything so ridiculous and hilarious that it's impossible to have a bad time.  I still have yet to have any sort of introspective feelings or personal revelations.   In fact, I would say I was completly coherent in my mind.  No wierd thought patterns or anything like that and conversation was easy. It's almost easier to handle than weed, other than the fact that your hallucinating intensly.

S put on Floyd's Animals (which is a glorious album by the way) and we dig into the nitrous.  This is where my visuals became ridiculous.  I was sitting at our kitchen table looking at the  curtains above our sink as I took my first balloon.  It was a double and after inhaling the balloon I was sent into outer space.  I saw a circle of heiroglyphics spiraling around my entire visual field and the curtains and wall had taken on a wierd purple and red color.  I knew it was because of the floyd because as the notes changed so did the colors.  Full-blown synaesthesia.

D arrives.  He eats his dose, but by this time we had run out of nitrous.  I asked him if he wanted to go get some more, which he did so we piled in his car and drove back to the head shop.  By now I was definatly tripping to hard to be driving.  I had been peaking for a long time it seemed like, but it had really on been an hour.  We picked up 2 more cases.

We arrive back at the house, and get started on the nitrous.  I ate a grapefruit and it was delicious.

For the next few hours, nothing out of the ordinary happened other than the fact that I was seeing shit.  By this time we had pretty much killed all the nitrous.  I've decided that nitrous is glorious while tripping and when I trip from now I'll make sure to at least have one case handy.  It stays with you alot longer than taking it sober, and it definitly made my visuals more intense.

I've come down quite a bit by now, but I'm still tripping.  S remembers that we had a little 10x salvia left and pulls it to out to smoke.  I had never had salvia while tripping before, and to be honest I was afraid.  Salvia is intense enough by itself, and combining it with tripping seemed like a terrible idea.  After a little peer pressure S and D convinced me to take a hit.  S packed up a bong hit for me and I sat down on my couch and hit it.  D recommended I do it in silence, but I thought this was a bad idea.  In retrospect I wish I had.  After taking the hit things went out of control.  I faded back into the couch and it seemed as if I was viewing the room from 20 feet away.  But just as quickly as that had happened the room was back in focus.  I had no idea where I was, who I was, or even what universe I was in.  I thought I had ended up in a different dimension.

D had turned the lights back on and as he did that I stood up (bad idea) and got the feeling that the whole room had twisted 45 degrees.  I began stumbling around trying to make sense of it all.  At this point D began to say alot of crazy things like 'your forgetting the sauce for the doorknob' but I thought he was giving me instructions on how to get back to the real room where I belonged.  S couldn't stop laughing and his laugh became part of my visuals.  It's impossible to explain really.

Eventually, one of them told me to sit back on the couch and as soon I did everything felt right again.  It was glorious.  Earlier, I said that I wished I had smoked the salvia in silence.  This was because I felt the music had been what distorted the room.  I felt like I had dissolved into the music.  I lost sense of my self and had become enveloped in the hallucination.  I felt that if I had smoked the salvia in silence without any external stimuli there would be only one place to go... deeper into my own mind.  
/n

D said he's projected his soul across the universe doing this.  I would like to try this.  The next time I trip I'm definitly going to try it that way, perhaps even while I'm peaking hard.  The salvia also brought me back to a peak for a while and stayed with me a while, similar to the nitrous.  It was glorious.

During this time I began drinking heavily in anticipation of passing out soon.  Walker Texas Ranger had just come on T.V so I watched that for a while and then passed out.  I could still hardly make sense of the episode even though I had almost come down completly, but I have difficulty making sense of that show even when sober.
/n
/n
Overall, I would say 5-MeO-Amt is definitly a worthwhile substance.  It's similar to acid in terms of visuals, but with a good body buzz though that acid seems to lack.  It's also extremely easy to handle.  It's so easy I'd feed it to a baby.  I kid.
