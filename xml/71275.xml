Its white, clean
/n
pebble-size paper,
/n
dry against unsure toungue.
/n
Time passes hazily
/n
(Time.
/n
 uhh...
/n
 what's that?)
/n
Gravity's 
/n
stone-breathed shutter 
/n
pulls green 
/n
into blue.
/n
blazing leaf geommetry riding
/n
the ripples of collision, 
/n
smells like light 
/n
at night
/n
sounds like air in space.
/n
oh, hello, Sun.
/n
How are youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.............
/n
Answer at once, shine dances penetrating
/n
through your little dome of ecstasy
/n
Laughter flows upwards
/n
bathing heavy brain with joy.
/n
Eyes close. 
/n
Patterns frolic seamlessly across eyelids,
/n
emerging from the breathing migration of patterns are 
/n
bright beams bursting into the mind.
/n
Eyes wide.
/n
Sun's final secrets ride 
/n
the sky red 
/n
kissing the trees
/n
standing quietly.
/n
I stand.
/n
Walking...
/n
towards some unknown future.
/n
Still riding the blissful seafoam of an acid brain.</bodytext></report>
