I took Effexor XR for diagnosed anxiety disorder &amp; depression.  Last spring, I decided to quit since I had few refills left and still had some serious depression-related problems (low self-worth, self-injury, no motivation, anhedonia).  I tried quitting altogether &amp; I felt horrible: hot flashes, feeling my pulse in my eyes when I moved them from side to side (rx information lists Effexor can affect pressure within the eye), disorientation, and general malaise.

About a year later, I went to a dr. who told me some people who quit outright have been hospitalized with high body temperatures &amp; other withdrawal-related complications.  She gave me an Effexor XR starter pack with which to wean myself off the drug.  Of the 2 weeks I went from taking 150mg/day to 75mg/day, I spent at least an entire week with the same miserable withdrawal symptoms, especially eye pulses &amp; malaise only made better by lying still.  The symptoms mostly disappeared while taking 37.5mg/day.

Unless a person cannot take or has not had success with other medications for depression/anxiety problems (Zoloft, Prozac, etc), I do not recommend Effexor XR.

If they are on it &amp; wish to quit, they shouldn't quit abruptly.</bodytext></report>
