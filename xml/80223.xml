Experience 3:
/n
/n
I was in my room, and feeling quite nervous. I had said I would get back into this stuff, but now it had come to this: take a hit, or stop spewing bulshit. I had brought a more expensive brand this time, hoping to get rid of the bizarre dysphoric effects I had experienced last time. I think it actually did help. I prepared my pipe, and inhaled, holding the smoke in for 20 seconds as -per-method. The comeup was much more gentle and friendly, compared to the Genie. Instead of being pulled sharply into the experience, from zero to very strong in just 5 seconds, I was lightly uplifted. I still hit a point of uncomfortable strength, but I had much more time to prepare for it. At this point, some body hallucinations happened. My perspectives shrunk, and I found myself a mote on the head of a giant that I controlled -- My body was the giant. This quickly passed. I then had a genuine psychedelic-type (LSD-type, not Datura) hallucination. I was standing in front of my room's window. It was fading to darkness, but the sky was still a very deep blue. There were raindrops on my window, and the street lamps were all on outside. I closed my eyes, then opened them...
/n
/n
A million stars burst to life, shining denile at the face of entropy. Me. I felt their hostility, but couldn't help being awed by their sheer visceral beauty. Then the state vanished, and it was simply water droplets and refracted streetlamps again.
/n
/n
I moved around my room for awhile, pacing. I was standing about four feet from my window, and suddenly, a large and solemn face stared at me. I began making some minor conversation with it, in a hushed voice, and the expression on it slowly changed. After awhile, I got tired of this, and willed the state away. I then realized what I had been talking to: Two lamps for eyes, the middle divider of my window for a nose, and a bit of refraction for the mouth. I didn't care. It was time for some music. Not for the music, though.
/n
/n
I have neighbors one wall over, and it was semi late. Even baked, I was mindful of being courteous. I turned on the music very low, and turned on the milkdrop visualizer for winamp. It's exceedingly difficult to remember what happens next, but, well, here goes.
/n
/n
Fractal patterns, and mathematical relationships that were never apparent before were suddenly clear to me. Where before, I had only seen colorful displays, now every single shape was drenched in meaning, function, purpose. Fractals, hidden behind layers of filters and never seen before were now utterly obvious. I could look at the screen, and have total mathematical understanding of what was going on, instantly. It was almost like a form of synesthesia. To some extent, I think my ego must have died, because while I was experiencing this in my flesh, I also was the experience in every meaningful way. After time indeterminate, I was sufficiently far enough through the comedown for this state to disintegrate.
/n
/n
Next, I took my iPod, and listened to my iPod, and once again, I achieved partial ego death. I also had odd visions, which are truly indescribable, having no basis whatsoever in consensus reality. They were NOT CEV's, which I have experienced since this trip.
/n
/n
There is nothing further worth reporting of this experience. I came down, and then slept.

Experience 4:
/n
/n
I was in the bathroom, because it offers easy deodorization, and easy cleaning. Also, I needed a shower, and had heard that it was awesome to do them when experiencing the altered states. Maybe so, but not for this, as I would find out.
/n
/n
I placed my usual amount of substance in the bowl, and lit up, took my hits, etc. Same procedure as before, and as usual.
/n
/n
As I came up, I made myself put the kit away, and suspended parts of my mini hookah in toilet bowl cleaner, which I have found really helps keep the stuff nice and sparkling. (NOTE: I rinse the stuff for at least 20 minutes after the high is over. If you use this method, make sure you do to!!!) I had to force myself to do this, with every iota of my will, such was my intoxication. I then got into the shower, and... Well... It sucked. Utterly and completely. Boring, and I had to force myself to wash. But I got paid back for this timewaste.
/n
/n
Seized by inspiration, I corked the tub, shut off the shower, and let it fill. Slowly I noticed that the warmer the water, the less sensation I would receive from the portions submerged in it. I quickly turned the water up to the maximum comfortable temperature (and I have no idea how I found that seeing as I was so numb, but I did.) I then kneeled in such a way as to support the maximal submersion of my body. For awhile it was just like that, the nonsensation slowly crawling up my body. But after the water reached a certain, critical temperature and height... Bam.
/n
/n
Depth perception was fucked. Utterly fucked. One second, I was looking at my hands under the water... The next. What. I watched as a Two Dimensional membrane in Three Dimensional space oscillate. These oscillations were ripples in the water, but at that time, I had no way to know that. My awareness of the outside universe stopped completely and utterly. The membrane was exerting an extraordinary pull on me. I obliged, and moved closer, and the state grew even stronger. The membrane ceased being a membrane, and I abstractly knew that I was seeing my hands, and not a membrane. However, in truth, I was seeing Mount. Valentine. I christened it thus, for my hands appeared to be clasped in the shape of a heart (they weren't really). Eventually, I pulled my head up, and saw the rest of the bathroom. I was filled with joy: the world was much larger then I had thought it was! I then began to play with the attractive forces of the water. It's hard to describe, but was very fun. After indeterminate time, I unplugged the tub, got out, and dressed myself. I then went downstairs, determined to test an effect I had read about: enhanced taste.
/n
/n
I pulled out some mexican 4-cheese, and had a tiny bit. Oh. Wow. Every single factor that made that cheese delicious was maximized. It was transcendent of itself.
/n
/n
And that conclude everything meaningful from this experience. As a note of interest, while I was just as high this time as last, it was MUCH easier to deal with. I think I may be beginning to get the hang of the  'High' frame of mind.
/n
/n
Experience 5:
/n
/n
See above. Nothing notable, really. It has gotten even easier for me to enjoy being high. There is no longer any dysphoria! I tried some other foods, and they were very enhanced. For some reason, chocolate sprinkles acted to briefly re-up the experience.
/n
/n
In conclusion:
/n
/n
Diamond Spirit is excellent, really. It offers a pleasant, enjoyable experience, and is also quite hallucinogenic. Not as much as I'd like, but still, a very nice 'bonus'. I'll do this at least once a day, probably.
