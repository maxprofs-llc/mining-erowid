Boring Stuff: This is, again, the Bromo-DragonFLY that was sold as 2C-B-FLY. The infamous B1 batch that killed people. After having done doses of 250 micrograms (ug) and 200ug, I decided to increase my dose to 380ug. I weigh 186 lb's.

I set an alarm for this dose at 7:35 AM. I'd groggily get up and stumble to my table to prep it up. Simple as sucking just shy of 4 ticks on my .1ml measured syringe. Then I sprayed it in the mouth. Washed it down with some water that was vigorously swished around, and swallowed. It was 7:45 by the time it was done, that'll be our T. I went back to bed, tired as hecks.
/n
/n
T+1:15hr: Girlfriend has to get up for school. I let her out of the house. I'm still sleepy. Go back to bed. Nothing so far. 
/n
/n
T+4hr: I wake up energized. Typically this stuff hits me at 3.5hr, but in this case, a bit later. Or perhaps I just slept through the first part. Maybe sleep slows metabolism. Either way, I wake up like an energizer bunny. I start to just tidy up around the room, and notice that my girlfriend left me a surprise 1/3 of a gram of cocaine that looked very clean. I'm in Peru, so I know it was. I set it aside.
/n
/n
T+6hr: I start to feel the ascent of effects. Visuals are creeping in. They are more like an outer glow to everything. Not much is morphing shape. No patterns yet. Not a whole lot. 
/n
/n
T+7hr: This is the time I find my effects increase a lot more. Seems consistent with me. Visuals are becoming hard to ignore. A curious internal energy is appearing on all objects. They have what looks like an electric current running through them. At this point, the mental space hadn't changed a lot. I was in a profoundly great mood, although I'm naturally so most of the time. So I'm curious to see if the cocaine would jumpstart my trip farther. Or somehow modify it to be more intense. I take what was likely 1/3rd of that pile and make a small line. My pulse prior to dosing this was 66 which, on a sub-amphetamine, seemed safely low. I felt no problems mixing two stimulants. I take the line that was likely about .12g. The cocaine down here is very pure, and this is one of the more pure batches I've done in my experience. 
/n
/n
T+7:30hr: The energy from the cocaine has hit. And hoo boy am I feeling a sensation. It was almost as if the cocaine energy merged with the Bromo energy. Cocaine just makes me very alert, not too 'speedy' where I'm jittery. The Bromo energy makes me jittery, and a need to clench muscles. Although not soooo bad. They sort of combined. Now I'm not longer jittery, but still very energized overall. Not clenching anything any more. Instead very in control of my body. And mentally, still alert, still slightly altered. But now thinking more clearly. In addition, the pleasurable wave of the coke felt great over the general tingle of the Bromo.
/n
/n
T+8hr: Here is where I feel the Bromo stops climbing, and settles into its peak. I noticed my visuals died down somewhat, perhaps the cocaine takes over for a while. Despite having a full rush of cocaine and Bromo, my pulse is an even 84. 
/n
/n
T+9hr: The visuals have managed to come back stronger. I find while nothing overly impressive is happening, color and detail are enhanced to a wonderful level. I start to take a bus to a friends house to help with his computer. The ride is pleasant, watching the sun over the clouds. The detail in the grass. The stucco and plaster walls on most of the houses look more interesting somehow. Also on this ride, I find myself thinking a bit more introspectively over some recent family issues. And while I really haven't meditated on it much, it was something to think about. And the Bromo didn't exactly shed a new light on the situation, but helped me to look at it without being angry at anybody. In the situation its easy to get upset. I managed to just look at the damage that has been done, without pointing fingers. Unfortunately this headspace didn't last that long. 
/n
/n
T+10hr: I arrive at my friends house to help him with his computer. Eventually figured out the problem. Unfortunately he broke another part in his impatience waiting for me. I found myself quite analytical of the PC, although I missed the obvious answer to the problem until we were about to call the company that sold the parts to him. Silly me. 
/n
/n
T+11hr: His Girlfriend arrives to accompany us to the store to buy the part anew, or possibly repair it. I find my Spanish with her was pretty good. The Bromo puts me in a nice conversational state. At this point my effects seem about the same as they were at 8 hour. 
/n
/n
T+12hr: We decided to get some food. I hadn't eaten hardly at all the whole day, stimulants will do that. Enjoyed a lovely sandwich which my friend bought since I helped with the PC. 
/n
/n
T+13hr: I started to feel the effects dropping, as well as my energy. I could feel myself starting to crash a bit. But I went back to my friends for some Borderlands on Xbox. I was just about as good as normal. 
/n
/n
T+15: I took my leave after some good Xbox fun. Tired though I just opted for a taxi home. 
/n
/n
T+16: At home, I finished the cocaine pile hoping to see if I'd get more effects back, and then I'd finish out the night. The cocaine brought me mentally into a similar place as before, cocaine but with a touch of extra intelligence. 
/n
/n
At T+18 I was pooped. I had watched some south park and such. Decided to take 1mg of xanax. I didn't really feel the cocaine any longer.  However, after another 30 minutes I was still awake. I felt the restlessness of the Bromo still lingering. I knocked it out with another 2.5 mg of xanax. And woke up later the next day as was needed. 
/n
/n
In summation: 
/n
/n
No effects from 0-3.5 hours.
/n
Buzzing and extremely minor visuals from 3.5-6 hours.
/n
A general increase in effects from 6-8 hours. 
/n
8-12 seems to be my peak plateau at this dosage. 
/n
12-16 starts to wind down. 
/n
Anything after 16 seems to be just further declining effects. 
/n

No bodyload was noticed at all. Occasional clenching desire from the Bromo. No appetite, however I did eat a couple times with no problems. Constant energy was available though, and while I never felt focused to DO anything, I believe anything I did in fact do would have been done quite well. In this trip I never broke past a mild ++. And I mean a conservative ++. That probably was between hours 7-9 it was in the ++ territory, only to settle back down. I question a tad of possible tolerance buildup since I did 200ug 3 days ago. But I will make a point to do this again another week. 
/n
/n
The next day I didn't feel very tired, although I got plenty of sleep. Overall, an enjoyable experience that I felt needed just a bit more dosage.</bodytext></report>
