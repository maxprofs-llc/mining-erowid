Hey this stuff is pretty good for the 'I have to quit smoking cannabis for awhile' blues.

It doesn't get me high, but I do notice slight relaxation and some small twinges of psychoactiveness for about 30 minutes after smoking a couple bowls of this stuff. Pretty cheap, and legal, too.  It helps to get my mind off cannabis.</bodytext></report>
