I read up on the subsatance kava on this very website, i am not about to become sucked into mainstream illegal drugs and i was looking for a way to be relaxed and feel and see wonderful things in a legal way. After reading the tesimonials i decided to give kava a try. my first few times the pills didnt do much but slightly relax me. lately i decided to up the dose and see if, like cannabis, it would work after a few goes at the drug. WOW! it is unreal. heres what i experienced...
