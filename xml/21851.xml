Earlier today I bought a gram (sativa-domintant strain) half/half with a friend, B. This was the start of one of the most intense cannabis experiences I have ever had it would be my first time hitting a gravity bong, i was very excited, and prepared to cough my lungs out...

B stuffs a tiny snap into the bowl, and lights the bowl while pulling the bottle up. I push down on the bottle and feel my lungs fill up with the thick smoke
/n
* cough *
/n
I blow the huge hit out, not holding it in more than 2 seconds because it was so bigI sat back and waited for B to take his hitthe effects were already noticeable , and quite strongafter B took his hit he loaded a bowl for me, and I hit itthis time it took 2 hits to clear it, and I could hold it in a bit longer. I blew out the smoke.
/n
/n
I see out of the corner of my eye that B is loading up his second hit, but I cant move. Some sort of emptiness came over my body, like my muscles werent there. I couldnt feel anything but empty space I kept saying to myself snap out of it, if I dont, I wont be able to moveit was really hard but I finally moved, and realized that I had to keep moving around or Id get stuck again. Keep in mind this was only 3 hits

B loads my third (and final) bowl, and it takes me 3 big hits to clear it, holding each for about 5 seconds. I sit down, my lungs aching from all the smoke.

Half-way up the hill I feel my legs burning, like they are about to fall off. I try to just ignore it and keep walking. suddenly I am locked in a repeating motion, over and over againleft foot forward, right foot forward, arms swing, cant stop, im going too fast now The feeling of helplessness grows; I can do nothing but walk, faster and fasterI never slow down, I couldnt if I wanted toI cant feel my legs anymore, but I can feel my feetwhere did the ground go? Im floating now, nothing around me.
/n
/n
Faster, faster, I kept walking till I was practically joggingI stop for a secondor was it 5 minutes, I dont know
/n
/n
ok, time to walk again walkingits hard to keep up a steady pace; Ill walk fast then slow, then fast again, then nearly stop Finally I approach my house, but right as I get to the front yard, my mom is backing out of the garage she says she is going to the store and asks if I want to come. I somehow mumble the words no thanks and go inside. I lock my door behind me and sit down at the computer
/n
/n
my vision is meltingthe computer screen is the only thing that is real, everything else is just a hologramthe computer screen is popping out, coming closer to my face Ok Ill lay down insteadsinking into bed? No wait, there is no bed, I am floating, higher and higher

This goes on for an hour, very intense, before I start to come down a bit. By 2 hours later, I was in an average high, and 4 hours later, I was basically back to baseline however, some lingering effects stuck around. I am writing this 6 hours after I smoked, and I still feel minor effects.
/n
This has been by far the most high I have ever been off such a small amount of cannabis3 small bowls, and I felt like I was on acid or something.

At some points you could say I was too high, though I usually dont think there is such a thing hehe

I find gravity bongs are the best way to get really high off very little weed.
