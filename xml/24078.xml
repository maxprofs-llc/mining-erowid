I had a sleeping problem so i got my doc to prescribe zopiclone. I took the pill and went to bed. After 20 minutes my racing thoughts stopped, and my mind cleared. My body felt very comfortable and heavy. I then started dreaming and quickly fell into a deep sleep. Upon waking up I felt good. No hangover. no tiredness. After two weeks of this my precription ran out. I had no withdrawl symptoms.</bodytext></report>
