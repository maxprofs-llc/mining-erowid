Apart from the MDMA which I consumed at about 1:15 AM, I had been smoking a steady stream of marijuana since about 7. I have IBS and am on 100mg tabs of Amitriptyline every night (Amitriptyline is Elavil, a tricyclic antidepressant. The effects of MDMA with tricyclics has not been extensively researched, so I wanted to post this as an account of my experience.

After taking the pill, my first instinct was to take a shower. It felt great, but I wasn't really feeling the pill yet by the time I was done (about 20 minutes). I dried off, threw some clothes on, grabbed my trusty MP3 player, tossed on my boots, and walked out into the late spring night.

It felt great to be walking, like it took no energy at all, or maybe like I just had plenty of energy to spare. I don't get out much, so normally I get sore before long. The 'pain' in my hips that was slowly rising after a few hours of walking actually felt kind of good. This could have been some sort of interaction with the amitriptyline, as another use for it is a low to medium strength pain killer and CNS depressant.

I walked down by the old lighthouse near the Yacht club and walked out almost all the way. There was what I believe to be a skunk that I noticed scurrying away ahead of me. It didn't bother me, and I kept walking. After a while, I saw the small dark figure coming back toward me, and it kind of freaked me out. Instead of let it get to me, I just turned around and walked back toward the bike path.

Whenever I encountered a single pedestrian (there was a festival going on so there are drunks out for most of the night), I was OK, but I got nervous around multiple strangers. It felt like they knew, even though I knew they didn't.

I was expecting the usual sensory craziness associated with shrooms and other psychoactives, but instead of feeling fucked up, I felt great!

I walked all the way around downtown, eventually purely in the interest of finding something to drink. I found nothing, but it didn't bother me until I was about 3 blocks from home. I felt dehydrated, my throat was dry, and I felt like if I did anything else without drinking something I would throw up, or maybe collapse. The feeling did not worsen, and I got home and let the dogs out with no problem.

As I had a thin layer of sweat covering my body, I grabbed a cold Mountain Dew and cranked the central air. I then sat down here at about 4:45 to start writing this. I am most assuredly still under the influence of all three drugs ingested (one being the amitriptyline which doesn't seem to affect me in the 'fun' way anymore). I think if anything the CNS depressant effects enhanced the MDMA high and they combined for a great experience.

I feel the overwhelming urge to go pet the dogs now, so I will end this log. Thanks!</bodytext></report>
