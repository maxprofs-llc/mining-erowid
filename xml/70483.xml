I took about 2.5oz of %41alc alcohol rectally using a monoject. In the first half second it burned, then stopped as soon as it had begun. The rest went in without complaint. Shortly after, I had to shit. Badly. For about 10 minutes after I had a slight-moderate irritation in my lower bowel. As it passed I got a mild alc buzz (was a low amount of alc for me).
