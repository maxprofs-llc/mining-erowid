Allthough I have only tried this once for myself and my girlfriend, I have found that the aplication of a mixture of kava extract and toothpaste have noticeable effects when applied to a bee sting. While the glycerine in most toothpastes dry out the toxins of the sting, the kava provides relief as a local anasthetic as well a reducer of swelling. Results were within 5-10 miuntes.</bodytext></report>
