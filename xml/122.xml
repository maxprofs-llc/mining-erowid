We use codeine as a recreational drug fairly often, usually about three times a week.  We take it in pill form called 'Codoliprane' which cannot be found in the U.S.(considering Codeine is not over-the-counter.)  We usually take about eight pills each in the course of one night, each containing 20 mg of codeine.  We turn out the lights and line the room with candles and spend about 3 or 4 hours writing, (thats what we do) and drinking red wine.

The entire experience is so relaxing.  When mixed with alchohol, (only wine, I'm warning you) the drug becomes similar to, although less extreme than, heroin.  Induces creativity and definitely not a problematic drug of any sort for us.  We've never experienced any strange side effects, hallucinations, or physical problems.  Yum.</bodytext></report>
