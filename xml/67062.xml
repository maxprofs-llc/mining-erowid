I had heard a lot about this stuff from various places online, how to some people it was very much like cannabis, and decided to try it out. I ordered from an online head shop, costing 3 for 800mg of normal strength spice. It came in annoying little sachets, and really needed to be transferred to a better container, but that was done in about 5 minutes, and over the evening I tried it I had 2 large bong bowls worth (about 160mg in total, probably within a half hour of each other). Less harsh to smoke than cannabis to me, though it still hurt my throat, just not enough to threaten sending me into coughing fits. The taste is very mild, although some people find it a bit sickly sweet. Not much smell is caused by smoking it, and what is there is very incense-like. I was in a relatively good state of mind before smoking, and was relaxing at home with my flatmate (who is also a close friend), home tends to be where I feel most comfortable and safe.

I've smoked cannabis many times in the past, though usually pretty infrequently. The effects for me of spice were certainly very cannabis-like - soon after smoking (perhaps a little more slowly than cannabis, and taking five to ten minutes to build to its peak), I felt the familiar cannabis head and body buzz, a general feeling of relaxation, mild giggling, similar altered perception, mild time distortion, appreciation of sights, colours and music, etc. It interfered with my coordination a little (not that I have great coordination normally anyway), and caused similar mildly strange ways of thinking, though I did find it easier to push away any anxiety/paranoia feelings that came on (something I sometimes have a problem with with cannabis). I also had problems while mid-sentence remembering what I was going to say. I was in a generally warm and fuzzy state of mind, loving the music I was listening to, feeling happily very stoned. I also enjoyed cigarettes greatly, which tends to also happen on cannabis. When I went to bed, the new pyjamas I'd bought that day and the bed felt *extremely* comfortable. I don't think it hindered my ability to sleep, though I do think it gave me a little more energy. The effects lasted at least 3 hours, although I went to sleep so I don't know how long the high would have lasted for.

The next day I had a smaller amount, maybe 40mg, and that gave me an hour or so of being in a nicely stoned state, with a couple hours afterwards of mild stonedness and relaxation.

I would say that for me, it lived up to its reputation of being cannabis-like. There was something slightly different about it that I can't quite put my finger on, perhaps something missing in its effects and their strength, but it was pretty close. It's very nice to have something like this that's legal and makes me feel nicely stoned, although it is annoying that spice is almost as expensive as real cannabis. However, as I said, many people online have said that this stuff does not work for them at all, or that the effects aren't enjoyable for them, or that it only works well when smoked in a bong (I've not tried it in joints). This is a great example of the fact that every person reacts differently to the same substances. So, if you do wish to try it for yourself, buying the small cheap packets to give it a try is probably sensible, so as to avoid wasting money, but I'm glad I gave it a try.</bodytext></report>
