I was initially prescribed Xanax 1 mg for anxiety/panic attacks by my doctor. (My dose has increased since then) 1 mg worked good for quite a while, but one day I was so upset &amp; stressed out I decided to take 2 mg.... and WOW! I was just so relaxed &amp; chilled out. Everything around me was peaceful, and the horrible depression I feel each &amp; every day just lifted for the time being....

Somedays when I'm so depressed &amp; feel like I can't stand being here for another minute even.. I take my Xanax (which kicks in fairly quickly) &amp; suddenly find myself thinking - 'life.... it aint that bad' It actually helps to be more productive &amp; creative as well. Kinda of weird, but thought I'd throw it in there.</bodytext></report>
