two days after my first DPT experience, i decided to try a combo. at about 11am, i popped 4 happy camper herbal mood enhancer combos, 5 yohimbes and put 3 dropper fulls of green tea extract in my coffee. i waited a half hour and snorted about 120mg of DPT, saving about 30mg to prolong my experience. then i grabbed my discman and put my coat on, grabbed an extra CD and borrowed 2 dollars for a whipit.

i was frantically trying to get shit together so i could get out the door quickly because i had that internal fluttering again but this time it was twice as intense, i had to get moving. i walked out the door and proceded to walk the perimeter of monroe. what followed was unbelievably enjoyable. 3 minutes down the road, the snow falling from the sky took on a beautiful texture, the patterns in the snow on the road and in the grass negan to separate and jump out at me in my peripheral vision. i was smiling and singing and just knowing that i was about to experience somehting profound.

another 6 minutes go by and i'm about to go pay for a can of whip cream. walking through the store was weird because i had the internal shakes pretty bad and i was afraid the people in the store saw them and i didn't want any problems, and i was praying that i didn't fall into convulsions before i got out the store. there was a line at the cashier and i didn't think twice about having to wait. i just kept walking and went and paid for it at the video section.

when i handed the cashier the money, my hands were just goping at it, shaking like i was withdrawaling from heroin, creating an embarrasing confluence with the fact that it was just a can of whip cream i was buying. she gave me a funny look and i took the whipit and almost jogged out of the store, i was about to explode with impatience. i proceeded to walk through the parking lot, enjoying the hell out of the snowy environment, it was comforting.

i felt like i was breathing the frshest, crispest mountain air ever inhaled. my nose felt crisp and fresh as well as my lungs and the air tasted wonderful. i started singing to my discamn and experienced a sort of weird kinda depressing phase of the trip. it was the affect the music was having on me, i was experiencing that thing again where i felt i heard the lead singer's attempts to get a secret hidden meaning across through the insanity of his lyrics and the way he structures his vocals. i felt lonely for aminute or so being i wa tripping by myself but it passed very quickly.

i ran across the highway and i felt it was easier to cross than it was sober, i had more confidence in being able to dodge any cars. from then on until about 20 minutes after my dose, the trip was pretty much the same. time was slowed down to a crawl, it was taking forever to get from one block to another. i saw vividly, the auras of people as they were hurrying to their cars or crossing the street or passing by on the sidewalk. occasioanlly, as i was walking, i would read signs here and there and every time i looked at one, as they crept on me, before i read what it said i expected to say something that pertained to me or my trip or something that had any kind of connection with the energy brewing in me.

i get to park at T+20 minutes, and i'm ready to inhale my nitrous. i'm still shaking so i fear i might go into convulsions when i inhale the nitrous so i amde sure there was nobody in the park and made sure i was comfortable atop the picnic table and took the hit. every thing was immediately almost overwhelmingly colorful. reality rippled with intensity and i hit nirvana just for a second. it was SO divine, so amazing, i prefer to have at least one nitrous hit for every psychedelic trip, and i recommend the synergy to any of my fellow trippers out there. it is the most amazing state of mind i've ever encountered.

this one wasn't quite as intense as maybe taking a hit on shrooms or ecstacy, but it was still very similar. i got up after i was confidant i wouldn't fall down and proceeded back across town. immediately, i felt this need to get to my home road so i could go all out and let all my energy out through spirit dancing, i was afraid to do it in the middle of town with people every where, but i was comfortable doing it on my home road. i do it even when i'm sober. so now i'm just speed walking through town, going through the same trips i had earlier, only backwards. i was still peaking and it was only T+40 minutes.

i was in a hurry to undulge the freedom feeling a get from spirit dancing. i get to my road and start letting it out and it felt unbelievably amazing to move aorund so flexibly, beneath the beautiful snow. i felt like the way i moved my hands and neck and arms was MY language of insanity, MY hidden meaning i was trying to get across to the passing vehicles. i get home and when i take my coat and shoes off, i notice i'm higher than i thought for some reason. i didn't get it, it was like being home with my family enhanced the trip like vitamin C would.

i sat down and watched a movie with my dad and brother. it was freddy verses jason, and some parts kinda made me feel sick due to my vulnerability, and other parts just tripped me out because of the special effects. throughout the whole movie, i was cracking jokes and laughing and having good quality family time and just enjoying the hell out of myself. the rest of the trip was just a very pleasant and slow come down. then, at about T+3 hours, when i was almost sane again, i snorted my 30 mg and instead of it having a tolerance effect, it brought me right back to where i was earlier, but only more stimulated because i was confined to my house instead of walking continuously.

I love DPT. i will definitely do my share of tryptamines in the coming years. but once again, i can't say this enough, BE CAREFUL. it's a research chemical not acid, it feels like it has potential to do more damage than acid could do. i could be wrong though, but the DPT trip is very psychedelic so remember, setting and positive energy. pleasant trips. peace and lots of love.</bodytext></report>
