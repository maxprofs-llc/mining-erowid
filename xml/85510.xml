(-1:00 - Caffiene, Cannabis [repeated]) After a tough week at work, I got home on my last day before a day off and went to bed. I slept for about 14 hours, so the day after I woke up at 6 A.M. feeling damn refreshed. I drank a quart of coffee as I always do, and puffed on some Ice-O-Lator hash, made from the strain California Orange Indica. 
/n
/n
(0:00 - 750mgs San Pedro Extract) Once I felt awake enough, (7 AM) I went to my bag of tricks and pulled out 750mgs of my San Pedro extract. I also ate a few very potent budder cookies made from the same Cali Orange. 
/n
/n
(1:30) Around this time my girlfriend was waking up, and we had a day planned. We took a shower, got dressed, smoked a bunch more, ate more cookies, and by 8:30 our ride had come and I was well into the onset and starting to trip. It was presumably around 100-400mgs of mescaline, the rest of capsules ingested are of a comparative equivalence.
/n
/n
Its important that I note I have a very special affinity to mescaline. On its own I could sing the praises of it for hours for its cornucopia of positive possible outcomes. Also, all the extract came from plants in which I have lived with for some time, developing a certain relationship, and extracted and processed all the alkaloids myself, adding another dimension to the relationship. I will always conclude that this is the cause of resulting continuous glowing experiences.
/n

Now our ride didn't know what I was up to. She was a member of my girl's skin care class, and no one else in the class would know either. But today was bunnies day to do her final hands-on test of facial cleansing, and I was her subject.
/n
/n
(2:00 - 500 mgs Extract) When we got to her school, she left me outside to get paperwork and so I could smoke some cigarettes. While waiting, I took another 500mg capsule of extract. 
/n
/n
She came back out to get me, and we walked through the hair care section, and I was blinded by the reflective metal chairs and bouncing walls of mirrors! Its a funny type cosmetology school with a lot of characters, and I could feel everyone staring at me, this rugged, out-of-place guy, following his girl closely, walking just a little awkwardly. It was a definitive relief when we reached the small, dimly lit skin care room. 
/n
/n
(2:30 - 250 mgs Extract) It had a back room with beds and calming music, much like an actual spa. I could finally relax and help my girl graduate and get a face massage while tripping at the same time. My girl, of course, always knows what I am up to, so despite the racket of walking through the school, it was a serene set and setting. It was a little after 9AM by now and I was having full blown visuals. Before I layed down, I took another 250 mgs of Pedro extract. 
/n
/n
(3:00) After a full spectrum of sensations on my face and reflexology on my hands and feet, I felt so clean and relaxed. It was great! I spent the entire time staring at the ceiling, which was morphing, collapsing into holes, and then reforming only to move to another area and create another hole. It was fascinating.
/n
/n
(3:30) Unfortunatly my girl had to stay at school, so after we were done she walked me outside and called for my ride. My ride came, a female friend, who knows I'm tripping, and had a plan to shop for flowers as a graduation gift to bunny. I really wanted to go and check out a this 5 star florist she was talking about. 
/n
/n
(4:00 - 500 mgs Extract, 12 mgs 2C-E) We went back to my house first. Its about 11 AM now. We smoked more Cali Orange, more Ice-o-lator, and ate more cookies. Then I went back to my bag of tricks. I pulled out another 500mg capsule of San Pedro extract and a 25 mg capsule of 2C-E. 
/n
/n
I don't recommend eyeballing anything ever, especially potent research chemicals. But it was pre-weighed, and frankly I wasn't terrified of eating the whole thing, I just wasn't that interested in going out that far. So I poured what I believed to be about 10-12 mgs of 2C-E from that into the capsule with the extract. I could feel the onset of the 2C-E by the time we were walking to the car to go to the florist.
/n
/n
(5:00) I was stoked when we got there, I let the Boar handle the talking to the clerks while I wandered around, watching the flowers explode like fireworks, the roots grow into each other and cover the ground, listening to the leaves breath...I touched and squeezed all the stuffed animals and giggled at the basket of special sausages they had for sale. I was having a grand time, and eventually my friend came and found me with the flowers she bought. I had to carry them on my lap in the car, so as she was driving me home, I dove into the centers of the flowers, staring in awe at the prisms of dew collecting on the petals, and the near perfect fractal patternings of the stigmas.
/n
/n
(6:00) I had no desire to return to my girl's school, so my friend dropped me off and she went to give her the flowers and get a facial treatment herself.
/n
/n
Now alone I could begin to analyze what I was experiencing. The subtle manifestations produced by mescaline were now in clear view, only slightly distorted by the 2c-Es slate of color over the vision. If there is any euphoria to 2c-E, then it is brought out in spades by mescaline, or 2c-E simply potentiates mescalines natural ability to produce the most blissful state I am aware of existing. 
/n
/n
Unfortunatly mescalines tasteful bodyload was distorted by 2c-Es strange uncomfortableness. It had no real effect, however, on my enjoyment of the wonderment. 2C-E's 'grounded in the reality' aspect definetly helped me keep in touch rather than floating away into a mescaline deepspace, which may or may not be a good thing, depending on how you look at it. This (and the bodyload issue) could even be alleviated by dosing 2c-E first, then the mescaline.

(8:00) My girl finally came home around 3, we smoked together and decided since I'm really starting to peak, on King Of The Hill for me to trip out to. Its friendly, familiar, funny, colorful, detailed and easy to follow. This catalyzed my experience into a ++++ trip. I experienced the uncontrollable laughter that is rather cliche of a reaction to psychedelics, and something I've experienced one time, the very first time I tripped. Since then, its all been serious business. It was amazing to explode with giddy affirmation that everything is absurd, and my girl caught my vibe, ending up with both of us doubled over with laughter for 2 hours at the antics of Hank Hill and his wacky neighbors. 
/n
/n
(10:00) I insisted on a shower, something that I have to do every time I trip, so after 4 or 5 episodes of KOTH, we hopped into the steamy, wet, flowing, warm, enveloping beauty of the shower. I couldn't balance myself right, so I sat and let the water pour over me, closing my eyes...
/n
/n
Where I was met with a cacophony of Hank Hill's, tiled in seperate colors of an infinite rainbow, patterning into a vortex, BWAAAHH!-ing into oblivion. It sent me into another raging fit of laughter, and I thought it couldnt get better until dancing Dale Gribbles and whimpering Bills Dauterive's floated into view, and I laughed so hard I ended up with a coughing fit.
/n
/n
(12:00) 7 PM came about, and it was apparent I was still peaking, 12 hours since first ingestion. I still felt great, I still felt energized, and if I didn't have to work the next day, I would've done some DMT. The whole experience was so amazing I would have felt comfortable dosing higher, or even adding in another substance or 2. But I knew my journey had to come to a close, and I tried going to bed.
/n
/n
(15:00) Not easy. I tossed and turned, not tired at all, and still enjoying the CEVs and occasional mescaline euphoria waves. 
/n
/n
(17:00) Eventually I fell asleep, around midnight, and got only 3 or 4 hours of sleep before work, when I usually try to get more. 
/n
/n
(21:00) But I felt ok when I woke up, and after my coffee and more cookies and puffing, I looked around and...this isn't an afterglow...I'm still tripping! It had obviously gotten less, so it didn't make me anxious, but visuals were still apparent.
/n
/n
(23:00) I went to work and enjoyed the vague trip I was still on, but I had an interesting change in personality. I didn't care to continue the 'mask' I have at work, and didnt feel like faking a chipper attitude, and spoke my mind more often, while Im usually a candid cat. Nothing out of hand or inappropriate, and nothing abnormal at all should I have been at home, and certainly not uncontrollable, just a general feeling of wanting to be heard, not taking any crap and egotistical as it may be, an overall better, higher vision of myself.
/n
/n
(36:00) Complete return to baseline
/n
/n
This was the finest combination I have ever experienced. I really feel like I struck gold with this one, especially if you want to most for what you do, this was easily a 16 hour trip with absolutely zero negative effects, anxiety or problems. Only 2c-Es strange bodyload, and thats to be expected. The smile never left my face.</bodytext></report>
