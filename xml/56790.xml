I have used various drugs throughout my life including: Adderall, Methylphenidate, Cannabis, Benzos, LSD and my favorite by a long sea mile OPIATES! I have also been intoduced to Kratom this past year which I also really like. I've found that while taking 60-70 mgs of oxycodone daily for months I can take 4grams of 10x kratom extract the next day and still get an awesome painkiller high.

Anyway, on to the main reason I am submitting this report. Throughout the years of opiate use as most opiate users do,  I would occasionally run into bouts of nausea. This can really take away from the opiate experience as one can imagine. There is however a very simple remedy - GINGER ROOT. As simple as it may sound every single time I have encountered nasuea from opiates I have simply gone to the grocery store and purchased fresh ginger for a buck or two. If using fresh ginger I simply cut off a half inch piece, peel it, cut it into sections small enough to swallow and I'm good to go. I  can also buy capsules at health food stores for a few bucks. I Buy good quality (organic or wildcrafted) and take 1-1.5 grams when I take opies or kratom. This really does work for me.</bodytext></report>
