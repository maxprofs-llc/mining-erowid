Making ether is relatively easy. What you need is:
/n
/n
Starter Fluid
/n
Plastic Water Bottle with a sports cap,
/n
Water
/n
/n
Empty the water bottle (or fill it) until it is about 1/4 of the way full of water. Then, you spray in the starter fluid until it fills the bottle MOST, but not all of the way. Shut the cap and shake vigoriously. After the liquid settles, there should be two noticeable layers. 
/n
/n
Open the waterbottle lid so it is open just enough to let a small pour of liquid out (not all the way open). Turn the waterbottle upside down and drain off the liquid until all the seperated water/contaminants have been drained off.

Douse a rag, not soak, and inhale normally. You don't have to huff hard and hurt your lungs to achieve the high. You also don't have to soak the rag as it will evaporate before you can inhale all that is on there- you'll be wasting it. Just re-wet the rag as necessary.</bodytext></report>
