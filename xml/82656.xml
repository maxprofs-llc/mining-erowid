I took one lyrica and 4 tramadol the first morning I got them filled. It got rid of all of my pain from fibro and myofascial pain. It was like my back was completely numb but where the pain was supposed to be it felt cold. Its weird visually also. Everything seems so vivid and alive kinda similar to 2C-B. These drugs also got rid of any anxiety that I had which is great and it also helped me sleep. Sometimes sleep on just tramadol isnt really sleep at all. Its more like laying awake and losing some time in between.</bodytext></report>
