Adderall has taken away my soul
/n
I felt so brilliant at first
/n
Capable of anything
/n
I could just go 
/n
and go
/n
and do 
/n
so much 
/n
people were envious of me
/n
because I never stopped
/n
never crashed
/n
ever
/n
And my drive
/n
my drive
/n
I had such discipline
/n
I was strong
/n
focused 
/n
dedicated
/n
confident
/n
and I was so 
/n
so 
/n
so 
/n
alive
/n
everything that came out of me was golden
/n
Crisp.
/n
Clean.
/n
Sharp.
/n
Perfect.
/n
I felt success
/n
It was coming
/n
out of my pores
/n
surrounding everything I did
/n
I was absolutely glowing.
/n
/n
But now Im just numb
/n
Stuck
/n
Hollow
/n
I cant finish a feeling
/n
My thoughts stop and start
/n
and I dont really remember who I am
/n
anymore.</bodytext></report>
