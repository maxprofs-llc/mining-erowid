Foxy... That it is. 
/n
/n
My freshman year of high school completed, I decided to celebrate the arrival of summer by, perhaps, tripping.
/n
/n
Acid is scarce here. So is everything. I had decided to purchase some DXM, when my dear friend 'Gannon' told me he had obtained quite a quantity of 5-meo-dipt. I researched it a bit here on Erowid, having previously been interested in foxy. So the plan was, Gannon was to stop by and sell me some.
/n
/n
I had previously enjoyed LSD with this fellow peer Gannon, but it was on uncomfortable circumstances: he was dating my best friend, and i felt like the third wheel. So I had some negative feelings towards him. The Fox changed this.
/n
/n
At around 8 PM, I'd say, Gannon came by. It was then decided he would take the foxy with me. He emptied ginko-biloba out of capsules and then using the tip of a knife, eyeballed out a dose from his little ziplock bag with the chemical name written on the outside. I must say i was a bit wary of his measurement, that he might try to rip me off a bit, thoughts that had generated from the negative feelings i had associated with him. 
/n
/n
We took the foxy about a hour later, with water. I was excited to try this new psychoactive, as is a child waiting in line impatiently for the next ride at Disney World. For some reason I thought foxy would be like dxm. I kinda had my hopes up that this would blow  me away or something.
/n
/n
Within around 45 minutes of ingestion, Gannon, who weighs 180 lbs and had previously taken foxy, vomited his share of the foxy, an equal dose to mine. 
/n
/n
We were waiting in my bedroom, a highschool student's mess of clothing, school papers, rodents, whatever. The house was void of all possibly interfering relatives, so the atmosphere was positive and free of paranoia.
/n
/n
I was waiting with giddyness, feeling an unusual metallic vibration in my body. The room looked as if it were blinking. My stomache felt horrible, horrible pain at the absorbtion of this beautiful substance, but we must endure this until the tryptaminey sets in.
/n
/n
After a while,i started seeing rainbow patterns everywhere in my field of vision. As i talked to Gannon, we were both shocked at how similar my voice sounded to one talking into a fan. My voice sounded robotic. I started doodling on MicrosoftPaint (which is fun to save bitmaps with and then look at when you come down, ad say 'what was i thiking??!') when the white screen became a profusion of intricate rainbow detailed fractals. They seemed to be made up of rainbow blobs of oil, Gannon and I decided were the 'Tryptaminey-blobs.' 
/n
/n
After discovering we had this observation in common, Gannon and I started to feel warmer towards one another. I began babbling all sorts of crazy thoughts, all at once. Thousands of
/n
thought patterns rushed my mind atonce. All were great ideas and made so much sense,I wanted to tell them all. Gannon would agree with what I said and act like he knew what i was talking about =). 
/n
/n
When Gannon began to speak,his voice sounded synthesized, and would decrease in tone until i couldn't understand what he was saying.
/n
Gannon and I had a long philosophical conversation of everything. We found that o foxy, we could correlate any object and idea. We found all sorts of connections and loops in the human mind, society, life, everything.
/n
/n
I did alot of thinking. Gannon and I were no longer separated by society rules. We knew each other by human spirit, not egos. We felt a sort of allyship by this Tryptaminey.
/n
/n
We had all sorts of new ideas together. We agreed this Tryptaminey was made up of color,light,and darkness. How much sense it made at the time.
/n
/n
Gannon had to leave, and by some stroke of misfortune i was left alone at the bathroom mirror. Flaws in my face became amazingly grotesque, my facial features would morph and stretch ad look like i was making funny expressions. I decided my face was hideous and horribly flawed.
/n
I then proceeded to observe my nude body in the mirror. It looked like a beautiful bronze and porcelain  statue. Then it would morph  into an underfed emanciated bag of bones,then would morph and become rubenesque. (Note to self: Definately stay away from mirrors.)
/n
/n
The fractals were amazingly beautiful. All colors of the rainbow, all at once. Intricately detailedgeometric designs,of the most brilliant hot pink,neon lime, bright blue, etc. Nowhere in the world had i ever seen such intense colors. Yellow as bright as a highlighter. Beautiful sparks of blue would explode in the air like fireworks. The fractals are very geometrically based and very beautiful to watch.
/n
All colors and lights in the room would morph into palershades,and then explode with such sheer brilliace of purecolor.
/n
/n
Unfortunately, music sounded horrible. Vocals sounded raspy and metallic, everything was in a lower key and waaaaay slowed down. Individual beats wereout of key. (Listen to Paul McCartney &amp; Wings 'Jet', it soundslike they are playing a kazoo!)
/n
/n
The body load was horrible. I would get these waves of this undesrciblable uncomfortable feeling. Felt like a lot of robotic pressure was being placed in every cubic millimeter of my body. 
/n
/n
But what I enjoyed most was the the thought patterns. I kept finding myself at a fork in the road, and mymind would attempt to goboth ways at once. An idea would have opposing side, and my mind would follow both sides. I could find continuing loops in everything. 
/n
/n
Time for a closing. This has to end somewhere, you know. The visuals were beautiful to watch, and i loved thinking complexly. If you like doing heavy thinking and enjoy bright colors, its definately worth a try. Foxy is my new favorite psychoactive.</bodytext></report>
