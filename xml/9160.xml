     The first time i tried mushrooms i did the traditional  method of chewing them and holding them in your mouth. I ate somewhere around  2.5 grams of dried mushrooms. I  found the experance very enjoyable. With  intense  images and thoughts when my eyes where closed to mild open eye visuals. The whole experaince lasted somewhere around 5 hours.

     The next time i tried muchrooms i tried smoking them. i smoked a large quantity  and began to  feel the same beginning effects as before except this time i didnt wait 30 minutes to feel effects they were damn near instant. I was feeling early begingings of a good trip  i.e.  trails breathing walls etc. I felt the effects become slightly more intense  before quickly wearing off. All effects had worn of  in less than 30  minutes.

      In conclusion i would say that eating the mushrooms is much more effective, is much longer and more intense.</bodytext></report>
