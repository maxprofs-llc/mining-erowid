About three monts ago I came across a web site that was selling legal drugs, that supposed to get you high. One of the products that I purchased from them was a product called Herbal Ecstacy, very popular on numerous web sites. I figured, maybe I can get a good buzz from it. I took two, the package said to take one to two pills on an empty stomach, nothing happened. I haven't eaten anything for 10 hours prior to taking the pills.

In the process of three hours I took 6 pills, my friend took 8. After three hours I felt my temperature changed and I thought, wow, I think I am starting to feel something, but in a minute it was gone, and nothing happened, my friend did not feel anything too. It was a complete rip off.</bodytext></report>
