I had heard about Salvia for some time and decided to try it out.  One of the websites offered a premium Hawaiian Salvia leaf for a little more than the Mexican, so I thought it would be a good place to start.

I tried the leaf on three successive nights.  First night I smoked 4 bowls.  Second night 2 bowls.  Third night 6 bowls.  Every time was the same: an immediate tingle in the head with the first hit and then --- nothing.  Just a little giddiness and lots of unfilled promises.

Had I not seen copious reports of effective Salvia experiences here on Erowid, I would conclude that Salvia was nothing more than the fake MJ trash you see in the back of magazines.  I did notice one other disappointing trip report with almost eerie similarity: supposedly primo Hawaiian leaf from an Internet seller which does little or nothing.  Maybe someone is shipping crappy leaf.

The only real effect is a loss of $18 and a pain in one lung.  If I try this stuff again, it will be with another supplier.</bodytext></report>
