Not a regular drug user. 60 years old. I have tried pot and all kinds of alcohol. Decided on this drug because of its nootropic effects plus a slight buzz. I always have my 2 teenage granddaughters to stay at weekends they dont need looking after and also my husband is now retired so he was also available if I needed any help.

One cap at 12 oclock another at 5 another at 8. After I hour started to feel good after 3 hours felt drunk. Children went to bed, husband also went to bed but I stayed up till 3 in the morning listening to the music channel singing along QUIETLY slept like a log felt great in the morning. I think 2 is enough for me.</bodytext></report>
