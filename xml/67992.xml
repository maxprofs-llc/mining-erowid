I'm a dagga fan, of both wild dagga and 'Marijuanilla' as its called. I had packed a normal sized joint of a herbal smoke mix called 'Tribe', and added in some crushed, dry dagga stems that were kicking around on a CD case. So, I walked down close to a spot where I normally walk during the summer. During the walk down I started smoking the mix, gradually. By the time I almost finished the smoke I started heading back. I started to perk &amp; pick up finally, as it snowed. The rest of the night I found myself with a body high, I was able to walk quite a distance a few hours later without feeling tired or getting sore. The interesting thing is that, normally my experience with dagga alone and with marijuanilla gives me a head stone. The stems came from some organic home grown dagga (leaf.)</bodytext></report>
