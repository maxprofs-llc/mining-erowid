About a couple months ago I went to a local club where most of us ravers like to go to every week. I had a few extra dollars on me so I decided to by some ectasy.(or what I thought was xtc) since no one I knew had it I decided to go asking around, I ended up asking some guy that I've never seen there before and he told me that he had some 'froggies' that he would give to me for $30. Being the naive idiot that I am decided to buy it even though I knew better than to buy a pill for more than $20. I went into the bathroom and looked at it only to find that it wasn't a froggie... it had a carousel horse on it and if I remember correctly it was tan.

So I decided to take only half of the pill just to be safe. I waited about 45 minutes to an hour maybe and I still didn't feel it kicking in. Then, all of a sudden it just hit me, I was overcome with the need to move my whole body incredibly fast. I thought I was fine, that it was just because of a little bit of speed in it or something but then when I still felt that way 20 minutes later I thought something was wrong. My heart was pounding out of my chest, I felt absolutely no effects that might of been caused by E, I was incredibly nauseous, my muscles tensed up, my whole body felt like it was on fire (I don't think I'd ever been that hot in my life) I noticed that it was starting to get hard to breathe and that my chest was starting to hurt. At that point I was beginning to think that I was on the verge of having a stroke. I thought that maybe if I lay down that everything would be better but it wasn't. People looked as if they were flying instead of walking, the music was going so unbelievably fast that I just wanted to cover my ears and scream. This was about 3 hours after I had ingested the pill.

Around the 4th hour I didn't even feel as if I was there, I thought I was dying. My skin was still burning, my heart was still racing. I was completely drenched from pouring water on myself. From that point on I can't remember much other than telling my friends how sorry I was and that I'd miss them but, when they tried to answer me back I couldn't hear a word they said or the music. All I saw was their mouths moving with no sound coming out. I'm not even that religious but I was praying to god the whole time. I just felt so far away from everyone and everything. The faster things went the hotter I got, the hotter I got the darker the room got. Finally about 5 hours later and at least 26 bottles of water later I started coming down.

Another thing I'd like to mention is the fact that when I ate the 1st half I put the other half in a wallet in my back pocket and by the end of the night my friend asked me to give them the pill so they could throw it away. I went to grab the wallet and then took the pill out, when I looked at it it was all smashed up and somewhat dissolved from being inside my soaking wet pocket. The strange thing was that it turned a bright shade of pink....??? I was completely baffled as to why it did that. Anyhow, I am sorry for writing so much, I'm just hoping that this might help someone in the near future. If I had it to do over and started to get the same symptoms again I would go to the nearest hospital a.s.a.p, especially if I had ingested more than half of the pill. I wonder if what I took was PMA./n   If anyone has had a similar experience to mine or has any idea if what I took was indeed PMA feel free to email me at msichickie13@aol.com stay safe!  /n
