Im submiting this trip report cause there is not to many others. Well i read one and that would scare someone away from soma's and i dont think that should.

I was afarid of doing them because erowid didnt have much info on them at all. Well i had bought 12 soma's for 27 bucks and the dealer said not to do more then 5 but he said 5 is a nice high and was ok to do. So I looked up more about soma'a when I got home and didnt find much. Just to note One picture that didnt look like the pills i had, it said that most somas are 350mgs are something i have no idea how many mgs are in the kind i took so dont go think you can take 5 and be ok.

Start Low, then work up. Dont be stupid. So i took the 5 pills and just hung out with my friend J that took 2 and we just chilled and played video games and listined to music. I began to feel sorta funny like i knew something was coming up and then i felt dizzy a little. And i couldnt think really hard to well. No notice to music like weed or anything but I had the urge to stretch and lift some wieghts for some reason. After i was done i felt like I was pulsating with blood and evergy inside. I got light headed every time i stood up.

I felt really good. J and I took turns hitting each other and kept saying it felt good and it really did. I kept getting up to work out for some reason every ten minutes or so and i couldnt feel it lifting up or down it was pretty cool. I then set down and chilled some more and got sleepy a little. Then there was no way i could get up and work out anymore all i could do was just sit there Me and J smoked the fine chronic after awile and played some more video games. So To sum it all up it was a good time felt really good the whole time. On the other hand though 24 hours later my stomach was hurting really really bad for a long time. I dont know if thats from that or that im just coming down with the flu.</bodytext></report>
