I have been supplementing my illegal drug use with JWH-018 and other synthetics for quite some time now. I did not realize this until I noticed my wife was not drinking very much (she is an alcoholic) and then not at all. She said did not like the way the alcohol made her feel anymore. We smoke a homemade smoke blend that I make and it is the only chemical we are currently using with no bad effects. This was definately a great bonus I was not expecting.</bodytext></report>
