I found this to be a very good mix.  Especially in case of being afraid of a bad trip on shrooms, and especially in the mountains.  The Xanax kinda blocked out alot of the cool mushroom thoughts, which was the only lame thing.  But after the come-up, I just kinda stayed in this egoless peaceful state of mind.  And it gave me extra visuals in the dark, probably from the xanax, they weren't very mushroomy visuals.  But I saw some great visuals when the sun set.  I walked up to this tree stump that I couldn't really make out in the dark.  It looked like a green lady, made partially out of leaves, and she was wiggling, doing some sort of dance.  The Xanax made me just watch it in interest, without any kind of fear.  I wandered through the woods that night, and it also seemed like all the trees were reaching out toward me as I walked by them.
