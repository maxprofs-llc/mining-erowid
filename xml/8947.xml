 Around October of 2000, some friends and i were going to have
/n
a typical smoke session. Maybe 5 people, some high quality
/n
weed. Well, i had a bunch of mushroom shake left from a party,
/n
and i threw it on top. Why not? I had to work in an hour and
/n
a half and figured the weed would be fading by then. 
/n
 So we toked it all down. Pretty soon i felt totally stoned
/n
out of my gourd. And more, it had the definate feel of mushrooms
/n
too. Great i thought, its really nice. But by the time work
/n
rolled around, i was still feeling like dancing through happy
/n
land. I had to call in with a lame excuse.

 Now, Aughust 2001, im sitting in japan (mushrooms are legal
/n
here by the way). I just packed a bowl full of mushroom shake
/n
and burnt down. Well, its definately giving some effects. Mild
/n
visual changes, sound and tactile perceptions are slightly mushroomy. Nice feeling.

 So, i can say mushroom smoking has an effect. However, the taste is rather bad, and usually causes a mild headache. Definately interesting though. If you have only 1 or 2 caps, or a bunch of shake, id say smoke the stuff, but use some weed to kill the taste.</bodytext></report>
