I have read many reports on this site that discourage the use of quetiapine as a recreational drug. I however have had good luck with using it in smaller doses when I have no other psycoactive substances around. I have been prescribed seroquel for almost 3 years and I admit at first some of the effects are intolerable, however if I can overcome or get used to some of these effects it can become a more pleasureable expierience.

I have taken as much as 150mgs and still been able to got to work at the factory. I have also still been competent enough to work the heavy machinery present although I tend not to. I could be different from every last person who posted on quetiapine, but I have had fun and information is information.</bodytext></report>
