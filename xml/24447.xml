Having read many experience reports on this drug, I was anxious and very nervous to try this (potentially) very powerful hallucinogen. Quickly, a small bowl was packed of the 10X extract my girlfriend and I had ordered from an online ethnobotanical supply store. I hit the bowl eagerly, in my girlfriend's (let's call her C) unlit dorm room. A pleasant gray light from the overcast sky (which I found beautiful) was filtering into the room, and the album 'Worship and Tribute' by Glassjaw (a mutual favorite of ours) was blasting on the stereo. I inhaled deeply the strange, not unpleasant smoke and exhaled when I could no longer hold it in. Suddenly, I became plastered to the bed, as if punched by some malignant phantom. My face and torso became indescribably tight, as if the walls were closing in and constricting me. I experienced a calm euphoria, and it passed within seconds. I eagerly packed another bowl, a much larger one this time, in an effort to do the job right! I smoked, retained, and then released.

Again came the constriction, much more severe this time, and it felt as if my mind was trying to free itself from my physical body, and that I would soon burst at the seams. I delved into complete and total incoherence, giggling like a maniac at thoughts that made no sense. It was coming, I was going to break though, the dissolution of the ego and the rational mind, an escape into a world of pure energy and...

But I was scared, and I, at the last second, fought it. I battled the Salvia and won. The high dispersed, and I missed my opportunity to take a mental vacation into the furthest regions of space.

It was C's turn. SHe smoked, held it in, and released. Within seconds, she had turned extremely pale and was shivering as if terrified. I kept asking if she was okay, and she responded by screaming 'Nothing belongs to me!!! Nothing belongs to me!!!' I became frightened, thinking that she would 'snap' and that I would have to physically restrain her form running around the room, etc. I put on her favorite cd (Counting Crows' 'August and Everything After') and tried to soothe her as best I could. Within a few minutes, she had calmed down. She later equated the brief experience to the peak of an extreme acid trip. If only I had let myself go, I would have been able to empathize.

What makes this drug so scary, I think,is the speed with which it comes on. If the effects took several hours to peak, one could easily adjust him/herself to them and 'flow' with the experience, rather than be attacked by it.

Because the drug was done in a dorm in which C did not feel comfortable, the Salvia magnified these feelings to an exponential degree. I had the worst trip of my life on mushrooms in my Bronx apartment (which I hate) and I could only imagine what would happen had I done Ms. Salvia there.

I will do this again, I will let her take me where she will, and I will do it in a park, where I feel the comfort of nature's embrace.</bodytext></report>
