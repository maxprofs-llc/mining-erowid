Several months ago I began using Adrafinil (a 'Nootropic') semi-regularily and am impressed with it. Generally tablets are 300mg however I've found that as little a 50mg has significant (albeit subtle) effect.

I find it stimulating in a way similar to l-deprenyl but a bit more intense(IMO).  Concentration, 'speed of thought', memory, energy, motivation, and alertness are all significantly increased for about 4-6 hrs.  Mood is mildly elevated.  For me there is a hint of anxiety as well but much less so than with 'dirtier' stimulants like caffeine or BZP...  Very 'crisp' feeling and as though my brain likes it.

Effects (for me) come on quite 'noticably' about 1/2 hour after ingestion and something of a 'rush' is felt with very mild but pleasurable 'energy waves' detected.  This is with 300-900mg.

It is worth noting that I consume absolutely no caffeine, nicotine, or any other stimulants and so am likely a good bit more sensitive to Adrafinil's stimulating properties.</bodytext></report>
