One day, I got a call from a friend of mine. He told me that a patch of 'super-acid' is available, and cost is an avarage 10e/blotter. Well, whatta hell, I thought, it has been quite long since last trip, and this really sounded spectacular. I picked a duty-free day for tripping.

The day arrived, and I remember the sunshine. I soaked the blotter in some juice, and drank it while smoking a tobacco. After 30 minutes doorbell ringed, and I opened it for a blummer to come and fix some pipes in our kitchen. After the blummer had left, I analyzed my feelings. Nothing spectacular yet, Absolute different feeling than those in acid, much more mellow, much more stabile. Little did I know, underestimating this psychedelic is something nobody should do.

Now my friend arrived, and I gave his blotter for him. We fixed a full-bowl of nice flower-indica. It gave a nice buzz on the top of this slowly evolving psychedelic trip. I started to mes around with my studio-equipment, making some utter psychedelic trance. Time stopped and I can remember the feeling of huge euphoria - but still, nothing really mind-blowing and psychedelic in sight.

After making music for several hours and smoking one more bowl of marijuana, I gave up - I was sure that there was nothing more to expect, and all I was going to get was this extacy-like euphoria. Little did I know, after my friend left and I got to be alone, the things started to take some very wierd turns. At one point I could not lie down, focus on anything particular. Surrounding world toke the shape of a 'wallpaper'. There were no depth. Everything I saw, was like flat paper texture. This freaked me out, since I couldn`t control it at all, I went outside.

It was magical to wander around a tiny forest. I felt so... well, lost, in a way. There were absolutely nothing that made sense in that state of mind. Any action I toke, was based only on instincts. I didn't scare at this sensation I felt, actually - I like the feeling of losing the control. Times passed on, and the darker side of this substance started to kick in. Strongest mindfuck I have ever felt in my life. While acid gives clarity and feeling of crystal-pure thoughts, this substance just wiped its ass with my mind.

It was oddishly that I did sleep. In fact, I could`nt recall any dreams, nothing at all. Still, after woking up, I could tell, everything is not like its supposed to be. This following day was so heavy and hollow. It was like id lost my interest for just being here, there - anywhere, like I`d lost purpose of anything. That evening, I visited my friend and told that I'm really messed up. Nothing gave me any kind of inspiration. I can recall that I still knew that this is only a result of substances draining my serotonin receptors.

At first this was fun, fun and fun - in the end, it was quite a hard and hollow, even a little scary experiment. It toke 3 days to recover fully from that twisted state.</bodytext></report>
