I recently I came to the conclusion I had a serious problem with alcohol so I quit drinking completely.  The courts have put me on an alcohol tether (SCRAM) which measures through my sweat.  They have put me in jail 3 times and just told me I was drinking every day last week and that I put something in-between my leg and the bracelet.  I did not, I don't even use products with alcohol in them (soap, shampoo, toothpaste etc.). The only research done on this product was done by part owner and a non qualified person of the company that makes these products.  This is a crock of shit! I am tired of going to jail for something I did not do.</bodytext></report>
