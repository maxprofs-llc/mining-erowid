This trip, probably because it was my first time ever using any psychedelic, will be memorable to me.  The time line that I have my trip in most likely isnt exact as it has been over a year since I had this trip and just now felt the need to post a trip report about it.  It should also be noted that we took this 5-meo-amt nasally which has been known to cause deaths, though at the time, I was too stupid to research the chemical first and did it anyway.  Dont forget it wasnt really measured which is another stupid thing to do.  NEVER EVER do something this stupid as 5-meo-amt can easily cause deaths if overdosed on.

T+ 0.00 - Some random guy and his girl, people I didnt really know, came over to my friends house and suggested we try some mescaline.  We were all up for it though they said they cant get mescaline right now.  The guy I did not know suggested we try 5-meo-amt saying it was almost just like mescaline though it will last longer.  Keep in mind this guy didnt tell us it was supposed to last a long, long time.

T+ 0.30 - Everyone gets extremely sick, including me.  Tammy, my friend, runs out the door puking outside on the sidewalk, the couple, Courtney and Jeff,  runs into the bathroom puking, and I just sit there with a bad stomach ache.  This stomach upset was unlike anything I have ever experienced.  The only way I can really explain the stomach upset is that my stomach felt like it had lots of acid from pop in it and is fizzing rapidly.

T+ 1.00 - Three of the four people that took this substance are already feeling the affects.  We talk about whether we are feeling cold or hot because we are not so sure.  This goes on for I dont know how long.  Then I finally have to go to the bathroom as I am so sick, but being I cant puke like everyone else can for some reason, I had to do the other method lol.

T+1.15 - I am not totally sure how long I spent in the bathroom, but I do know when I was finished, I walked downstairs head first because It was the right thing to do as I put it.  So my friend and her friends are talking and listening to hip hop.  This hip hop is really aggravating as it feels as though it is thumping at my heart.

T+1.30 - Random people arrive now that three of us dont know, though Tammy knows.  This freaked us three that were tripping out, though did not affect Tammy because she knew the people.  One of the people we were tripping with, wasnt necessarily racist, but he thought African Americans were people to steal no matter who they were so this caused chaos on our come-up.

T+1.45 - The people that had came are now gone now and I am reading peoples fortunes as at that moment I think I am gifted by the Gods to foresee things.  I tell Courtney she is going to wreck and she would be on the front page of the newspaper.  This freaked her out quite a bit and it did me as well later that week she actually did wreck and was on the front page of the paper, though not related, still freaky.

T+ 2.00 - 4.00 - Somewhere between these times I must have went insane as I, and no one else, knows what anyone did during this time.  Its as if we just all were sucked into some sort of void and no one can remember a thing.

T+4.00 - At this point everyone is tripping extremely hard and I am receiving such awesome OEVs.  I go into the living room, and look at the painting of the lion.  This painting was incredible, the hair of the lion was flowing as if there was wind and a woman, though the woman is not in the actual painting, kept appearing behind the lion and smiles at me.  I am not quite sure how long I stayed here but I do know it was very fascinating.  I go into the kitchen now, sit in the middle of the floor and absolutely admire the vinyl flooring.  The vinyl flooring was made up on purple and pink flowers though at the time of tripping I did not see the flowers.  Instead I was seeing these purple and pink vine like structures just swimming in water, as if they were snakes even.

T+5.00 I become bored of visuals at the moment and decide to sit in the hall of the apartment.  Thats when I started seeing a very strange visual.  I was seeing the walls as normal, however, though the walls were normal, water was seeping down these walls.  It was like a waterfall.  I was getting scared about this though because I was sitting right beside an electricity outlet and thought it might cause a power surge and kill me.  I finally got a hold of myself somehow and decided that I was on a drug and that it would all be over soon so I should just sit back and relax.

T+7.00 Another memory lapse prevents me from remembering the hour between 5 and 7 so I had to start with 7.  I, at this time, find myself in the living room with everyone in there listening to hip hop music.  Tammy, I noticed, was sitting on the right side of the couch totally engulfed with something.  She had her eyes closed, most likely enjoying some vivid CEVs, with a huge smile in her face.  When asked what she was doing, Tammy just told us she was sleeping.  (Its barely possible for me to go to sleep on 5-meo-amt by the way.)  Courtney and Jeff are on the other couch and appear to be fighting, though this could be a hallucination.

T+8.00 - 11.00 This is when the trip takes a turn for the worse which ruins the rest of the night for me.  Tammy retires up to her bedroom so I am left down there with Courtney and Jeff, two people who I did not trust nor did I really know.  I witnessed Jeff hit Courtney, unless this was a total hallucination, not sure, and it made me quite afraid.  I told Jeff to not do that again to her and he looks at me and tells me to mind my own fucking business and to go to hell.  This upset me quite a bit so I just laid down on the couch and tried to get my mind to quit playing tricks on me.  It was not working apparently.

Next thing I know, Jeff comes up to me and says I am messing with his girlfriend and he is not at all fond with that.  He then proceeds to punch me in the face, I think anyway.  This sparks something up in me and I run and hide in the bathroom for about 3 hours.  I go into Tammys room, she is laying down with her lights off and I am freaked out really bad.  I keep telling her that something bad is going on and I am not sure what.  She laughs and assumes it is the drug, which it could have been.  I run to the bathroom again to hide as even Tammy doesnt believe me.  I then go back into Tammys room where I find all three now in there and I cant grasp how because I thought it had only been a few seconds that I was in the bathroom.  They all ask what is wrong with me and start laughing hysterically.

T+ 12.00 We all decide to head back downstairs because the upstairs wasnt right.  We sit the remainder of the hard trip out which was another hour.  Courtney and Jeff still arguing because Jeff has to go to work and they did not plan for the trip to be this long.  Courtney and Jeff leaves, still tripping like a dumbass, and he actually went to work that day.

T+ 13.00 Tammy and I watch Rugrats, possibly the funniest show while tripping.  I felt as though I was Tommy so it was pretty cool.  I lay there trying to figure out when this trip will be over because my head is hurting and I really want to go to sleep.  I look outside and saw probably one of the funniest things ever at the time.  I saw 12 janitors in a tree.  There was no janitors as I made Tammy look.  They were swaying back and forth til one fell down and I laughed so hard.

T+ 15.00 Thinking the trip was over as I had not seen any visuals in such a long time, I decide it is time to go home and go to bed.  I get in the car and make it out of the driveway just fine.  I then get on the ever scary interstate.  An ambulance passes me and right at that moment I felt as though I was in that ambulance and this caused me to fuck up bad, I nearly wrecked.

T+ 15.30 Made it home, lay down, and get on Yahoo.  Talk to people while tripping and find it was so boring.  I ended up deciding to lay down on the couch til I fell asleep which I did not fall asleep until T+ 25.00.

I wake up the next morning knowing I will NEVER do 5-meo-amt again as it is way too long and it seems it fucks you up really bad.</bodytext></report>
