I recently had gone to Toronto, to visit the HotBox cafe to pick up some salvia extract. I purchased about one gram of 20x extract for about $40, with the intent to getting completly fucked. My past drug expereince includes marijuana/hash, cocaine, LSD, mushrooms, ecstasy, and i had tried salvia one time prior to this, which induced visions of aliens. I was hoping to get another such trip.

I went over to my buddys house, who I will refer to as G. My friend K was already there. I brought my little vial of the brownish/black extract and my lighter, with hopes of throwing it in his glass bong.

He allowed us to smoke in his basement, which was a rare occourance because his mom really wasnt cool with us doing anything like that in the house, but luckily it was only us and his brother in the house.

I dumped out a little pile of the extract on a peice of paper...an eyed-off two hits (it turned out it was a perfect two hits). I was sitting in G's pink comfy chair, G in the other one, and K sitting behind us. I loaded the 2 hits into the bong and attempted to spark my lighter...it was dead, shit. The only other option was matches, and knowing salvia needs a high temperature to burn well, I used two matches simotaneously. I lit them, and drew the flame onto the bowl by inhaling. I took one long, large hit from the bong and pulled the rush. I held the hit in for about 20 seconds, and in the last 5 seconds of which, I began to feel the familiar effects, a sense of gravity, tingling body, raised temperature, and an overwhelming feeling of confusion.

I tried to ask K for 2 more matches but all that came out was 'Uhh..I, uhh..more..matches'. Luckily he understood me. I lit the matches, and took another ripping hit. The last thing I remember of actual reality is placing the bong on the nearby table. What happened next in reality, and what happened in my mind are two completely different things, which I will explain separatley. First I'll tell you what happened in my mind.

I lost complete touch with reality and all I could see was a room of spinning, and mixed colors. The only sounds I heard were scrambled roars and screams, which could not be made out. I could see no other objects which were in the room. My two friends K and G were no longer K and G, they were two other beings, who were trying to trap me in this spinning room. I had never felt such intense fear in my life and all I could rememeber thinking was I'll never get out of this, I'm here forever'. So I attempted to 'leave' this intense room of color, so I stood up and began to walk, trying to escape. I was then told in some weird language, which I understood, to sit down, so I did it, and ventured back to my pink chair. From that point on things began to be more and more real, and I began to gain my vision of what was in the room, and lost the sense of being scared off my ass. But all I could say for the next 5 minutes was 'Holy Shit'. I felt my forehead and realized I was pouring sweat, and then noticed my shirt was drenched.

Now I will tell you what they saw happen with me. After taking my two hits I placed the bong on the table and started leaning forward in my chair. I then said 'Its getting hot' and thats when G noted that I began to profusely sweat. I then began talking about a cross of some type, and tried to grab a burning incense stick that was beside the bong on the table. After that, I was just completely slurring all my words and not making sense, the only words they would make out were 'Match' and 'Cross'. Then I started looking around like I was deeply paranoid, and jumped up out of my chair, and began walking as if I was completly wasted, and tried to leave the room. G then told me 'Sit back in that chair', so I did it, then came back to reality. The whole time they were just laughing at me, so I assume thats why I was hearing roaring, and such.

This was not at all what I expected from the salvia, I was expecting a euphoric trip, like my first one, not a fearful intense one. But this was still amazing, and I still have a bit left, and plan to soon use it.

And a note for anyone who uses this stuff...USE A SITTER..I could have at any time knocked anything over, or fallen and hurt myself if my friends werent there to tell me what to do...happy tripping ;-).</bodytext></report>
