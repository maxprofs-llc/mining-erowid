I asked my doctor for some Lyrica (pregabalin), to fight my general anxiety. I'm right now under the influence, and it's strange, world is kind of buzzing around me. I have bursts of euphoria every 10 minutes or so. I don't want to sleep, because the feeling is unique, I want to experience it in its fullness.

I would advise this drug. It makes me mellow and happy and sociable. Ask your GP! Dreamy days are about to begin, it's my first day under the influence. Cheers!</bodytext></report>
