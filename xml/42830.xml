Okay, now the trip was a bit ago, back when I was put on wellbutrin for depression. One day, after being on it for maybe 3 weeks, I was pretty depressed (they said it would take weeks to kick in) and decided to take 12 150mg pills of my wellbutrin one morning before school, around 7:30. Now this was back before I ever even touched any other kind of drug (besides prescription), and I wasn't doing it for any kind of trip, just cause I wanted to see what would happen (maybe pick my mood up?).

Well, I went to work (work experience for school) at a computer store, around 9am, and I was feeling pretty weird. I was really warm all over, My hands were tremouring, and my whole body would shake and shiver from time to time, for different bursts of time, once for about 20 seconds my whole body shivered and twitched, and my legs gave out after it stopped and I fell to the ground. It wasn't eazy putting together a pc when I couldn't stop shaking my hands. Physically I felt empty, kind of like a hollow statue of myself or something. I was very indifferent emotionally, also feeling empty in that department as well.

As time when on, maybe an hour, I started to feel pretty bad, like the beginning of a harsh fever. Shivering, warm inside, cold skin to touch, sweating badly, it was pretty crappy. Mentally I was almost more aware, my thoughts went by pretty quickly, but it was weird, like when someone asked me a question, I gave a perfect answer (which I would have had to think about for a bit), and it was like before I actually did conciously think about it, the words were there in my head, spewing out my mouth. I dono how else to explain that. I stayed at work till I was done and eventually just went home instead of to school after the work experience, (around 1-ish) and rested in my room, watching tv as the feelings came in waves, but overall was depleating, until I fell asleep, not sure what time it was.

The next day I was just dead. My brain wouldn't work, my body felt exhausted, not like tired, just not wanting to work for me. And I wasn't hungry the entire day. I didn't eat during the experience at all either, food almost seemed discusting. I don't know how other people got some crazy hallucination from this drug, but I wouldn't suggest using it as any kind of tripping device. And frankly, I think it should really be evauluated as a anti-depressant.</bodytext></report>
