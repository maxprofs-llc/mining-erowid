I will not bore you with unnecesary details about my life. I have taken Cubensis 3 times prior to this experience, even higher doses, and experienced nothing like this.

Yesterday (Friday Feb. 2nd, 2007), myself and my younger brother (18 years old, I am 20), decided to trip on some of our dried cubensis. We decided to increase our dosage from last time, to 2.6 grams, as these seemed to be extremely potent cubensis. We went far from humanity, out to a beautiful spot in nature, right by a river, with birds chirping and a generally pleasant environment. We took our doses at the same time, at 2:30 PM. We sat on a warm rock in the sun, and smoked some cannabis while waiting for the effects. After 15 minutes, I could feel my thought process changing, getting deeper. I felt happy, but that anxious feeling of coming up was present too.

By 3:00pm, the first real effects began to kick in on both of us. We decided to walk.

We walked along the path by the river, where there were no other humans. I could feel myself forgetting or losing everything in my psyche I had ever learned about social interaction and communication. Me and my brother walked along, until we came upon a beautiful tree. I touched it, and I felt so understanding of the tree. I felt sorry for it, because it could not move along with me and experience all the wonderful things to see. But we kept moving, and we would stop every couple of feet to marvel at some small rock or shrub and how beautiful it was. Every place we stopped took on a brand new feeling, that was so overwhelming and beautiful.

Finally we came to a sandy spot by the water, that was in full sun. It was warm and we liked it. So we stopped here. We sat on the sand there for at least an hour, although I had no understanding of time at all. The subject of time was very confusing. I repeatedly tried to figure out what time we started tripping, and how long we had been tripping for, but found it impossible. Why should there be a beginning, and an end? that is not our natural function. We are eternal, never ending. It was at this time, sitting on that sand in the warm sun, that I entered a dream. EVERYTHING that I could perceive with my eyes, was a visual. Everything that I looked at was surrounded with black, although it is impossible to describe what I saw, It seemed to all follow a theme. What was real I could still see, but it was much more colorful and beautiful than normal. It would also warp and twirl fantastically. Plants seemed to wave at me. Everything was surrounded by a blackness, which I believed to be space.

We then stood up to leave that spot and return to the car to listen to music. As we walked (it was a long way), I felt I was extremely tall, then I was getting lighter. We walked to the top of a hill, where there was a cliff, at least 40 feet high. I walked to the edge of this cliff (very dangerous looking back on it), feeling more like I was floating to it at this point more than walking, and a gust of wind shot up from the cliff when I looked down. When the wind hit me, I was flying. I remembered EVERY dream I have ever had, at the same time. and it felt exactly like I was flying. I could fly. It felt so good, the best feeling in my life. I was actually flying, and there was not a chance in hell anyone could have convinced me I was not, because I was really flying.

I looked down the canyon, from where I stood, and I could see myself down by the water, playing as a kid. As a child my parents would always bring us to this spot to play, and I could remember all of those feelings as a child playing by the water. I remember how badly I would want to stay when we had to leave. And I also remembered so many dreams I had experienced, where I was in this exact spot. I believe I was in a lucid dream, while awake, I had returned to this spot that I had dreamed of so many times, in real life, and in the dream world at the same time. This was the best part of the trip. Absolutely indescribable bliss.

My brother felt the same thing. We did not speak much, but we understood each other. I KNEW I did not need to speak to him, because he understood me without me needing to. I honestly don't know if we experienced some form of telepathy, but he told me afterwards that he felt the same way. We were communicating without words or on a physical level. This place had a huge significance. I felt as if leaving this spot would signify something extremely big, but I was not sure what.

When we finally left, I could feel the trip change as we walked away from it. We got in the truck, and lit a cigarette. I found it amazing that I only had to take one puff of the cigarette, and instantly felt it 10x stronger than if I had smoked the whole thing when not high. We began calling them pleasure sticks, because only one puff would bring on a feeling similar to the drug MDMA. Then we loaded a bowl of ganja, and found the same to be true with it as well! one puff and I was stoned out of my mind. It was awesome! I have developed a tolerance to weed, cuz I smoke too much of it, but on shrooms, that doesn't exist. I was so blind it was like the first time I smoked weed.

Then we drove to another spot/n, where we began to come down. The come down wasn't pleasant. I realized that tripping that hard must have some repurcussions. It took over two hours for us to come down. I felt as if I was learning everything about reality again. I literally felt my conciousness COME DOWN to another level. I felt stupider, more restrained. As reality began to take over more and more, I felt so much knowledge, understanding, compassion, slipping away from me. I strongly believed, and still do, that the place where I went on these mushrooms was the place we go when we die. Our bodies die, but we just leave them, and go on to another place, another world, another body maybe. I fully understood and realized this. I also found many flaws in our society, government, etc. I could think so clearly, and understand so much, I can not even begin to describe what I learned.

The reason we tripped so hard this time may be because we forgot to drink, and got dehydrated in the sun. We had bought drinks to avoid this, but carried them around with us the whole time, not really understanding why or what they were for. So we did not drink until about 7:00 pm, sitting in the car, and suddenly realized we were dehydrated, that's why we were STILL tripping. I thought I was sober, when marijuana leaves grew from the stereo and covered the entire dash. After drinking a half gallon of water (I was SO thirsty and didn't even realize that's what that feeling was) I vomited, urinated, drank the other half, and was finally sober.

We got home, and it felt like it was the first time I had been there. I took a shower, and when I got out I felt so clean, fresh and new. I made decisions to change my life for the better. I realized I was doing a lot wrong. I feel that my life is forever changed, in a very positive way, by these mushrooms, and I am very grateful. I will not do shrooms again with anyone except my brother.</bodytext></report>
