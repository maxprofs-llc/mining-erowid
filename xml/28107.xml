Upon hearing of an herb that provided lucid dreaming, I was immediately curious.  When I received my ounce of the herb (through an online vendor) I was quick to make the herbs into capsules by grinding them up and fitting as much as I could into each one.  Before bed I took 6 capsules (due to my body weight I assumed more was better) and smoked 1/2 of a rolled cigarette of the herb.  Within a half hour I was having the auditory hallucinations often told of when using calea.  I would hear small chatter in the distance, and here and there it sounded as if something small was playing around in my room (like a small animal).  Background noised from outside would confuse me, and it would take quite some time for me to decipher what different noises were.

Other than the noises, I noticed little other effects of the herb.  I have tried calea several times to date, now, and still the story remains the same.</bodytext></report>
