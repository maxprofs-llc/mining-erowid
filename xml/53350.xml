/n
/n
T - 0:25 - Quite dizzy and tired. Focusing is difficult. Movements are exaggerated. A 5 degree rotation of my head feels like 45 degrees. The cannabis like buzz is transforming into something unfamiliar.
/n
/n

T - 3:00 - Im walking in the countryside with my dog. I try to call her name but cant speak. Within a split second Im home watching television with the remote control in my hand. I keep trying to change channel but cant focus on the buttons. 
/n
/n

T- 3:19 - I step back and the girls reappear. I notice a snake behind my stereo, worms in my bed and spiders on my door. The floor is covered with food. I reach for some but it disappears. My dog multiplies. I can see 3 of her.

/n
/n
T-6:15- Fall asleep (3:30am). Very lucid dreaming. This was the most enjoyable part of the experience because the unpleasant physical effects were left behind. The dreaming state was clearer than the waking state. I occasionally wake up next to a porcelain head then realize its actually my pillow.
