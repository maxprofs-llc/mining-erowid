I've had trouble sleeping for years, I've taken all kinds of sleep drugs and I have to say this stuff really helps. I never have trouble sleeping once I fall asleep, but I always have trouble getting to sleep. Melatonin solves this.

About 30 mins after taking this, I felt naturally tired and ready for bed. Works great.

Only side effect is that the dreams are amazingly vivid. I never usually dream. While taking this drug I've had some amazing dreams and some of the worst nightmares I've ever had. At one point I woke up in the night convinced that someone had broke into the house. Took me several minutes to figure out it was just a dream, it was truly frightening.</bodytext></report>
