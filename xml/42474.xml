Around 2 years ago a friend and I were bored of the fun but limited possibilities of weed and alcohol and were really craving to try some halucinogens, having both only really ever experienced a trip in any way from higher dose cannabis intake any step up we decided would certainly be interesting.  So unable to get hold of any 'real' halucinogens, LSD being hell to get hold of (I still as of yet have failed, but the friend mentioned has managed to try it and I'm eternally envious) and shrooms being out of season we turned to looking up less known halucinogens and in little time turned to nutmeg.

I read up on taking nutmeg and tried to make an educated guess that we should go for about 30g of fairly fresh powdered nutmeg each, which sounded easy as pie on paper, but  when confronted by 30g of nutmeg you realise that that's quite a quantity of reportedly vile tasting powder to tackle, still we pressed on. My first mouthful wasn't pleasant but was all that bad, the taste is a bit strong, and the powder got stuck all over my mouth and isn't water/saliva soluble so it's not a nice feeling.  After a few mouthfuls it starts to get really nasty tasting and we decide that we need a different method.

So I decide that it's a good idea to try and fill a pie with it to mask the taste, bad idea, you need to chew to eat a pie and that spreads the nutmeggy filth round your mouth, and if possible putting it with food makes it nastier as the food seems to absorb the taste, which is ok when it's a sprinkling of nutmeg, but not when its 30 grams. After forcing down the pie we opt for making tea with the remaining nutmeg, an easy sensible option which I don't know why we took so long to use.  All I can say is that nutmeg tea is the easiest way to consume nutmeg, but it sure is filthy, is bitter as hell and there's a nasty taste which at that point is only bad tasting, not mind bendingly horrible tasting, but that'll come.

So we wait a few hours and nothing happens, we had hoped it'd all have started by then, we'd be flying, and ready to land and resume life not long after, but still nothing.  Then we made the only sensible decision we'd made all night by giving up and going home.

A good few hours later and I still can't get rid of that taste, or the smell from either my mouth or my mind.  It's like my stomach is sending up the flavour and it's making me feel very sick, which makes the taste even stronger.  It's only then that I really realise the effects, they must have been working for quite a while but I'm not really sure because I hadn't even noticed it up to a point and then I realised that the effects were quite strong.  I wasn't really tripping but it felt and looked a lot like a low dose of mushrooms or a high dose of weed, where I'm not having obvious halucinations but my vision and perception of proportion and time are altered and distorted.

I get stuck in areas of thought and am easily distracted, I spend hours just sitting on my bed feeling really screwed afraid to move in case I sick up, it was not nice!  After a time I think I made some attempt of going to bed, my memory goes completely after that until some time the next day, when I'm still pretty screwed.  I go to see my friend and he's been through the same and we're both still wrecked.  This lasts into the next day when I have to attempt going to school.  What a mistake, I spend half the day lying on a table inthe common room and the rest of the time dodging lessons because I knew I couldn't deal with it.  After that day I think the effects subside.

The horrible taste and the weird headache it brought all the way through the first night (a headache which was horrible but not really pain, seemed more like the taste and smell of the nutmeg mixed together with the feeling you get in your brain when you're dehydrated) and the taste or smell of nutmeg or even thinking for too long about that night brings back the headache and strange feeling until I can distract myself.  Nutmeg was certainly powerful, and interesting, though I would never say pleasant.  If you really want to try something legal but strong and interesting, give it a go, but really work out how much to use because too much really isn't nice.

I won't be trying it again however desperate I get, there's a reason thing like nutmeg abuse aren't popular, it's cause they're horrid!  There are much more fun drugs out there!</bodytext></report>
