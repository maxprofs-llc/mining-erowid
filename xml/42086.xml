I take somas and alcohol on a frequent basis. I also take just 2 somas but the alcohol varies. Sometimes, I am in a great floaty kind of state and other times I am passed out or pissing myself. Somas mixed with alcohol can be great fun, it's like heroin for me. I work at a strip club and the somas make me fearless and not care if guys are assholes or not. It also makes me so relaxed that I have actually passed out on a customer while giving a lap dance! It's kind of funny when I look back on it, but I also think it is probably dangerous and I should quit before I o.d.</bodytext></report>
