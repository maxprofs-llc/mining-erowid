Hello I'm not talking about any one experience for of all in general. They asked for people taking Prozac daily that use psychoactives. I have been taking Prozac for about 2 years now only 10mg a day though. I was going to list each of the main substances I use/ed and how it effected me while on Prozac.

Alcohol:

Alcohol and Meth were my first major favorite drugs that I started using at age 12. I finally turned into straight drinker, drinking everyday. I couldn't stop, from the time I woke up till the time I blacked out drunk I wanted to get drunk. I started on Prozac and within a month all of sudden, it was actually creepy, I had no desire for alcohol and almost quit cold turkey when I never thought possible. I've went two years now and have been a bit buzzed a couple times. Prozac lowered my tolerence so bad I have 2-3 beers and I'm passed out. I feel like I've never drank in my life and have no worries because I hate alcohol now.

Cocaine:

I never got too bad into this stuff, I was well into Meth before Coke. Doing lines almost has no effect, Smoking it gave me the biggest rush and best high but wore off within 20 minutes and I was back to normal like nothing happened.

Methamphetamine:
/n
This has to be my all time fav, most addictive one. I'm not sure what effect is the Prozac and just basic Meth side effects. But it started when I was 12, I had minor anxiety problems and found Meth actually cured it until I was coming down then it would hit a lot harder. Eventually I developed panic attacks. It got so bad I thought I was dying everyday and I quit Meth. I started on Prozac about 2 years ago and the panic attacks stopped and have little anxiety. So then I start using Meth again. Now I'm up to using Meth and Marijuana along with prozac everyday now. For some reason I always get way more higher then everyone else, but my tolerence goes up so fast that its starting to have bad effects. I can't even function now without it, I can't get out of bed for days without Meth. When I'm on it, I don't get high high anymore it's more of like a 'Welcome Back Bob, Hope You Stay Higher This Time.' I litterally am in bed without it and when I get up I'm exhausted and yawning. This continues until my next hit, see I'm a smoker too. That's the only way 'll do it. I don't know how safe it is for prozac and meth but hell I'll take my Prozac right after hitting my crack pipe.

Marijuana:
/n
I never was too much into pot until I went back to school and Marijuana helped me graudate. I started my Senior year taking six classes at school and then coming home to take six classes online. Marijuana helped me through most of this. I smoke probably 1/2 to a gram before I hop in the shower, after I smoked like a dime of dope. That's how I try to start the day everyday. But Marijuana I've used at least 3 times a day EVERYDAY not missing one day for 2 years at least.

Hallucinogenics (Psilocybin Mushrooms):
/n
I know this has to be from the Prozac because I researched and remember reading something about it. I've never had any visuals and never had any audio hallucinations. I can eat more then anyone else and its almost like getting stoned to me. The first time I felt them the most then my tolerence went up the most. Although with the Azurescens on Prozac or not had the most effects. I would feel giddy and almost in a drunk like state. But I was able to function normally. Matter fact I used to eat em before school during season. It never had to much of a major effect though like what most other people say. And I remember I did shrooms one time before Prozac and the whole time I had major energy, and I laughed for like the whole night and into the next day. Since prozac I've never come close to doing that. I haven't done shrooms in a while, ever since I got bad into Meth I've quit just about everything but still Marijuana 3 times a day but only a few hits each time, and my prozac and meth. That's about it anymore.

Now as far as the prozac itself when I first started taking it my anxiety went totally away and I got all this natural energy and I felt really good about my self. I used to have a problem getting to sleep and waking up but I could go to bed fine and get up after sleeping half as long feeling better. Since then the drugs have reduced the effects of the Prozac (I truely believe) to where its almost the same as I was before it except not as extreme. My anxiety is back and panic attacks here and there. Except my sleeping problem is bad, my friend who does same amount as me has no where near this problem. Without it I have to sleep 14-20 hours. 20 only after being up for a while (go figure) I've done a lot of like prescription drugs like Xanax and Oxycontin and stuff but the main ones were listed above. I felt that Prozac would have been a miracle if I didn't get back into drugs, but it still even after all this, has little effects that are noticable.</bodytext></report>
