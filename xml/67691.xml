After trying Pirecatam orally with orange juice for a while and hardly getting any results, I decided to try something different. I had found no reports of the powder being taken up the nose, but I thought it couldn't hurt to try. And did it ever hurt! The pain of it up your nasal is pretty bad, but what was this this? It worked! I had unlocked its full power. One or two good sniffs are enough to give me a nice buzz. I notice increased confidence, sociability, energy, and mood. It's nothing like the oral method.

Of course the only downside is the immediate pain it causes, which is why I haven't made a habit of this. It's something I'll do sometimes before going out to social gatherings. The effects only seem to last around the one hour mark though. Overall, it gives a pretty enjoyable experience on its own, proving that Piracetam actually has a good use!</bodytext></report>
