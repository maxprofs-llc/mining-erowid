I'm not a very experienced psychonaut, but I had experimented with a few psychedelics before this 2c-t-7 experience. I had tripped on LSD a few times previously and on DXM about a dozen or so times.

The experienced started when a friend of mine (we'll call her Carroll) said she had found some acid to trip on for a concert we had planned on attending. She said the one caveat was that it wasn't 'real acid', but a research chemical called 2c-t-7. I had done my previous research and knew a little about the drug, but I was hardly an expert. After a few browsing online for a bit, I figured I could handle it, and she invited her friends over who sold us the drug and also accompanied us to the concert.

T=0:00, Carrol, her two friends, and I consume the 2c-t-7. They all take approximately 30mg and I take about half.

T=2:00, Everyone is starting to come up, but I have yet to feel anything. Noting my tolerance to previous psychedelics, I decide to take the other half of the powder increasing my total 2c-t-7 intake to roughly 30mg.

T=3:00, We all ride downtown to see the show, but as soon as I get out of the car, I inform my roommate (Iris, who is not under the influence) that I am not feeling well and desire to go home. I am still not experiencing heavy mental effects, but my I do experience slight nausea. We get a cab back home, and this is where things begin to get interesting. As I exit the cab, the entire world becomes very distorted. I take 2 25mg seroquel in an attempt to abort my trip and go to bed.

T=3:15  It felt very similar to a low dose of LSD, but unlike LSD, it made me extremely paranoid and frightened. I made my way upstairs and bundled up on the couch, hoping that by closing my eyes and focusing inward, I could stop the fear from the external world. Internalizing made the experience much worse. I couldn't feel my body, but at the same time, I felt uncomfortable everywhere, as if I had been sitting in an uncomfortable position for hours and couldn't move an inch. Nothing I did alleviated this feeling

T=3:20, I act very irrationally and panic, screaming at my roommate and ordering her to fetch me water, or leave, or please come talk to me. I tried anything I could in desperation to make things feel normal. I could feel the seroquel kicking in, and I became very drowsy, but closing my eyes only made the experience much more intense, so I felt at constant war to keep my eyes open or shut. Suddenly, every few minutes, my entire body would collapse into one singularity in my the middle of my head. Each time this happened, I was sure that I was dead, and was surprised when once again I was able to open my eyes.

T=3:30, My roommate is extremely confused, and at my urging, calls an ambulance.
/n

T=3:45-7:00, after stumbling down into the ambulance, I'm brought to the local hospital. I'm very fidgety, and cannot concentrate on answering the medical staff's questions. My roommate fills out all of my paperwork and insurance information and informs the staff of my condition. I see demons in the shadows which terrify me. On occasion, I open my eyes and forget where I am. I forget taking the drug and feel like I am going in the hospital because I am dying, or maybe I've already died? I rip all of the cords and probes off of my body and stand up and wander around, before the nurse brings me back to bed.
/n
/n
T = 7:00, still tripping very hard, the nurse informs me that I must go home in order to work things out with my insurance so I'm not dropped for using illegal drugs. I protest loudly, but eventually I'm convinced to go home. I still feel as if I'm on the edge of something, in a very uncomfortable position with no way of resolving my situation. 
/n
/n
T = 7:15, I lay down with my roommate in her bed trying to sleep. I feel very paranoid and every little noise and visual (most of which, I'm assuming, weren't real) consumes my conscious. I feel that this is never going to end. I wish desperately to go to bed.
/n
/n
T = 12:00, I wake up the next morning early, as I have class at 9:00am. I jolt up when my alarm goes off, and find that I am no longer tripping, and have no hang-over effects. I'm overwhelmed to be sober, and literally weep at having been given a second chance.

Following this experience, I've had a few flashback experiences, some rather minor and others a bit scarier. Sometimes after smoking large amounts of cannabis, I'll re-enter the 'tripping' state of mind. This usually does not scare or disturb me, as I'm equipped to handle it and it's more reminiscent of a very mild LSD trip than anything like my 2c-t-7 night. Other times, while not under the influence of any drugs, typically when sitting down in the same area for long periods of time, my entire vision will begin to tunnel and everything will slowly spin. Objects will ebb and flow, and grow larger and smaller. Also, my breathing becomes somewhat irregular and exacerbated when this occurs. These flashbacks are much more ominous and bring me back, thankfully with much less severity, to that horrible night.

I personally wouldn't again try research chemicals or anything else that hasn't been studied thoroughly. If you choose to indulge, I'd recommend starting off at a lower dose (15mg or so) bearing in mind that 2c-t-7 takes a really long to come on, so it's easy to over-do it.
