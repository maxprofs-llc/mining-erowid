I have recently been experimenting with various substances to treat my Anxiety disorder. Namely Kava, taken in form of an Extract (Tincture). On a particularly Anxious evening I decided to ingest around 35 drops of my Kava Extract, as well as ingesting 1 300mcg tab of Melatonin and 1 Cap of 50mg 5-HTP.

I had been in a very unrestful anxious, state much of the day, as I am much of the time. I wasn't on any prescription medication for anxiety not having took any for over 2 months. This was adequet to cleanse myself of the SSRI I was taking.

I ingested the substances around 9:00 PM and within 20 minutes began to feel effects. The most notable was a very nice relaxed, calm state of both mind and body. This led me into a state of warm euphoria, nothing like a hard drug, but enough to cherish. I liken the feeling to say 1 Soma or 1 Vicoden.

At around 10:30 PM the drowsines won over my faculties and I retired to my bed. Oddly enough it took me around 45 Minutes to fall asleep. During this time I continued to feel very relaxed and at ease. I slipped off to slumber unknowingly. Waking up the next morning at 6:30 AM almost void of any after effects I was filled with memories of vivid dreams.

I could recall vivid states of intense euphoria, though I couldn't recall what actually felt good about it. Just that I had felt that way. There were no definite story lines to note, but a memory of vibrant images. Mostly scenes with colorful sets, familiar faces. It all seemed very real.

In retrospect I figure half dosing the Kava, and maybe excluding the 5-HTP would have allowed me to be more conscious of the dreams. I recommend these combinations to the explorers of the dream realm. While these substances are relativily safe, remember to read precautions, educate yourself, and use common sense.
