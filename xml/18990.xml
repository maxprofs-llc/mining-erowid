I had heard so much about nitrous but had never tried it. Which is surprising because once I've heard about a drug which sounds appealing to me, I usually go to all lengths to find it. I saw it every time I went shopping for years but never decided to buy a pack.

I decided to finally try it so I bought a pack of 4 whippets and got everything ready. I was alone, and in my garage sitting on a chair and I had everything assembled in front of me. I filled a balloon, inhaled and held it in. Within about 20 seconds I felt slightly numb and euphoric.

It was fun, but I wanted something more intense. so I cracked the rest of the cartridges and filled up 3 balloons. I inhaled each balloon one after another holding in each hit for as long as I comfortably could. After starting to inhale the second balloon, I was hit with in incredible rush and a numbness that started at my lips and quickly spread throughout my body. I inhaled the third balloon and all of a sudden I was overcome with a feeling that I was a balloon being blown up. It felt as though with each breath I took, I would expand larger and larger until it felt like I was about to burst. then I popped, it was like a full body orgasm that lasted for a second. I quickly stoop up and waved and shook my head back and forth. This felt very good because I felt like I was floating and when I moved my head fast it felt like I would float higher and higher.

The high only lasted about a minute, but it was incredibly intense.</bodytext></report>
