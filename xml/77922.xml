There I was
/n
/n
White powder
/n
/n
Lights off
/n
/n
Bed made
/n
/n
I lit the lighter
/n
/n
The powder quickly became oil
/n
/n
The oil seeped into the wool

can I do it???
/n
/n
Yes I can I take the 4th cottony hit
/n
/n
4 Large hits through a bong
/n
/n
I hit the pillow
/n
/n
Impossible visions
/n
/n
I remember
/n
/n
Entities say hi
/n
/n
They say goodbye 
/n
/n
I am waking up
/n
/n
Reality is becoming clear again
/n
/n
DMT hyperspace is folding back into the 3d world I'm used to.
/n
/n
I'm being reborn.
/n
/n
Now I remember who I am.
/n
/n
/n
But I forget how it feels to breakthrough
/n
/n
I forget about the impossabilitys.
/n
/n
And on my life goes
/n
/n
Load, Light, Toke, Remember, Forget.</bodytext></report>
