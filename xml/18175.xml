This weekend R and I tried the N,N-diisopropyl-5-methoxytryptamine for the first time. It's always a bit exciting and a bit scary trying a new chemical for the first time. We were lucky to have G there as the sober sitter. I recommend this to anybody trying a new chemical or new method of ingestion. You don't want to become the crazy naked person running up and down the street that is picked up by the cops.

We put the chemical in to little gel cubes, I thought that this would be the best way to insure accurate and repeatable dosage. We added 250 mg of the 5-MeO-DIPT to 200 ml of gel mixture and divided this into 64 doses of approximately 3.9 mg each. I initially took 3 cubes, which gave me approximately 12 mg of the 5meo-dipt. R took 4 cubes, for a 16 mg approximate dose.

Initial effects were felt at around T+30 minutes. We went into the spa for the initial come up phase. The first effects felt were a bit of a stony feeling, then minor distortions to my vision. There was an increase in sensuality, touch felt sooo good. After we got out of the spa, R and G went and took a shower together. I went back to my room and laid down. I felt so alone, being there by myself. I started to experience more body load, my muscles tensed up. My heart started to beat faster, I estimate at around 105 BPM. I didn't really feel like taking my blood pressure, but I will have somebody do it next time so that I can see the correlation. I put on Nine Inch Nails - Rusty Nails II. It seemed an appropriate album, but it was very dark and it didn't help my mood at all. I was soooo relieved when R and G came back, as I had started to irrationally worry about R, him being tripping and all. Once they got back all became happy again.

I don't recommend taking this drug alone. I really don't think it would be fun, be with your friends. I took lots of pictures and spent some very special time with R and G. This substance seemed to be very recreational and not very entheogenic at the dose level that I took. I wouldn't have a hard time interacting in a public place, concert etc. I plan to try this substance again, probably at around the 20 mg range.</bodytext></report>
