I was with some friends one night, sitting around smoking a j. One of them said that he had some pills - muscle relaxers, he said. He handed me one and I examined it, as I usually do with pills that I don't know about. It was a white circular pill with -Seroquel- and -200- imprinted on one side. I decided to wait to take it until I could get to the handy-dandy PDR.

The next day I got online to check it out. It turned out to be an antipsycotic, not a muscle relaxer, as my friend had said. I was skeptical about taking it; Antipsycotics can be scary stuff if you don't need them. I said what the hell and took it. Two hours later when nothing had happened, I said 'Oh, well. It was free.' When my roommates came home (about an hour later) we were cleaning house. I was doing dishes, when all of a sudden Zang! - I was gone without any warning whatsoever. I struggled through the dishes, and made up an excuse to leave, because my roommates are straight, and they have a child (I don't like to trip around children - they ask too many questions).

I had to drive to my brother's house several city blocks away (NOTE: It's my opinion that driving under the influence is incredibly stupid and dangerous). The drive there was terrible, like being really drunk. When I got to my brother's, some of friends came over for some beers and blunts. My brother suggested I not drink any beer, and I agreed. I did smoke a little of the blunt, but didn't feel anything because of the Seroquel. I kept having to get up for some reason, even though the body high was like a Dramamine high. The mindfuck wasn't as bad, but I was still pretty loosely screwed on. I had trouble making out what was going on in the movie they were watching. Certain things on the screen would be very hard to figure out in my mind.

As the evening went on, I slowly got more sober and more talkative, which was good because I drive back to go to sleep for work the next morning (7AM, and I couldn't call in, because one of my roommates is the manager).

Overall, it wasn't worth the risks. I could have easily ended up in the hospital or had siezures, or some other ill shit like that. I knew I was taking something powerful, but I had no idea it would be like that.</bodytext></report>
