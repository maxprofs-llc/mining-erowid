Opened up a 37.5 mg phentermine capsule and snorted it in a series of 6 lines.  The first 'bump' was like a very dull version of cocaine.  It does not have the numbing properties of coke so it burns the nose a bit.

The phentermine made me feel awake and talkative and it totally suppresses my appetite.  The good feeling lasted roughly 15 - 20 minutes.  Then I took one line about every 15 minutes to keep it up.  The feeling became more awake then high though.  Not nearly as fun as coke, but I would do it again maybe before work as it really wakes me up.</bodytext></report>
