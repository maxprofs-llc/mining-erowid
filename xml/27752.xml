Today I purchased a 100gm bag of powdered kava root from the local health food shop. It was imported from Fiji, and cost only $6! After reading online that I would need to eat quite a lot, I decided to make tea out of it. I heated 25gm of powder in 2 cups of water for about 10 minutes, not letting it boil. Then I strained it through a t-shirt. Being a frugal dude, I repeated the process with the same powder, using this time, one cup of water.

I drank it all within 30 minutes. Taste was kind of alkaline, with a very numbing effect - although nothing like cactus juice. I have to say the taste grew on me. About 10 minutes after finishing, just as I was about to brew up some more, I noticed I was feeling a kind of drunkish happiness, so I decided to wait and see how it went. Probably a good thing. I got quite high. Quite like a physical drunkenness, with a very clear head, maybe clearer than usual.

After about two hours of talking with friends, and a few beers, the drunk feeling passed and the kava feeling changed to an opium like buzz. I curled up to sleep in my friend's bed and woke up after a long nap, feeling nicely refreshed. I will be taking kava again.</bodytext></report>
