I decided to take 400mg of Trazodone. After it began to kick in I started to feel 'fuzzy' and distant. I then proceded to get an atrocious headache. My heart beat like a jackhammer. I then went into a Secondary Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizure, This was the result of a Complex Partial Seizure.

I had to be taken to the hospital and given large amounts of Dilantin, Tegretol, and Lorazepam just to bring me out of the seizures. I went into coma-like state as a result of being in seizures for so long. Luckily it appears as though I did not suffer any brain damage. Please stay away from this stuff, it is a strong chemical, I have never had a seizure before in my life, but this stuff sure made me seize.</bodytext></report>
