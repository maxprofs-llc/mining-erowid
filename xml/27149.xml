Well for a long time I had wanted to try Absinthe because I read and heard alot about it but I never had the chance to buy any. Until one day about a week ago one of my friends came over and had some Absinthe with him. I nearly freaked and begged him to let me drink some. Instead of letting me drink some he gave me the bottle and told me I could have it(it wasn't full anymore he had drank most of it the night before with some friends only about 0,33 liters left).

He advised me to dilute it with some water since it's pretty harsh to drink it straight(which I also did). Well I was getting ready to go to a Party and I wasn't about to share so I drank most of it on the way to my other friends house who was gonna drive us to the party. Once at the party, I diluted the rest of the Absinthe that was still left again with water. I wasn't experiencing anything yet only a subtle buzz and a feeling of extreme calm and serenity. Almost like when I'm high.

Well about 2 hours later with the bottle already being empty I was definitely feeling something. A feeling like explained earlier just very very calm and a slight buzz. Then me and my friend went outside to talk and started walking. While walking and talking with my friend I could really feel the Absinthe. It felt like I was sort of high sort of drunk, a mixture of both I would say. And everything was calm and I felt almost weightless. This lasted for about 45 Minutes and then I could barely feel it anymore.

Later on when I was home already I started coming up with real cool shit and got really creative. I started writing a couple of lyrics and just felt very good and felt like thinking. About life about everything. And that's about all I have to report, I would definitely do this again and I'm looking forward to it next time.

Also I think I should note that while at the party I drank nothing else. I just wanted to experience the effects of the Absinthe alone.</bodytext></report>
