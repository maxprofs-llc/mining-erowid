Yea I had a very bad problem once.  Me and my friend smoked a couple gravitys (a container to hold smoke in water to push smoke into lungs) of some chronic $50 an 8th, I was ok when my heart started racing really bad to point I thought it was going to explode.  My chest tightened and I started to get scared to where I was walking it off and controling my heart.

That wasn't as bad as the recent experience.  I have smoked for a bout 3 years now mostly chronic, and it seems getting high has lost intrest aka negative effects.  Today I smoked 2 bong packs of some good weed, I was getting a powerful buzz through out my body.  Then it happened my heart beats got weaker and weaker.  I thought I was dying or something.  The tighting of the chest happened and my hearing faded and rang, my tongue went numb and the arms and feet as though as I felt my body dying.  I started to move real quickly and to get my heart beat up.  It took like 30 mins to feel like I was alive again.  I made it through that buzz killer but now I'm scared of smoking weed again.  It haunts me already of that moment where I thought I was going to die of 2 bong packs.</bodytext></report>
