New Years Eve was approaching, and although I do enjoy my usual laid-back family celebrations, I thought I could go for a little more excitement this time around -- courtesy of the MDMA which I had recently obtained.

Although Im somewhat experienced with stimulants (mostly diverted pharmaceuticals) I had never tried ecstasy before. It seemed that I could never find a good time to use it  my expectations of it were high enough that I didnt want to waste it on any old ordinary day. New Years seemed the perfect occasion to try it for the first time.

I had it on reasonably good authority that the pill was, in fact, MDMA, so I was fairly confident that the experience would be more or less what I expected, and although it was New Years, I didnt want to cloud the experience with alcohol. I decided to snort the pill, simply because the very acts of getting out the straw, cutting the line, etc. are enjoyable to me  Ive effectively been conditioned to enjoy that stuff, as its always followed by euphoria...But I digress.

I figured out my timing (I know it seems anal, but I like to plan things.) Id test the waters by railing about one-third of the shit at 9:15-ish, and depending on the results of that, do the rest of it about 45 minutes later.

Here goes. (Ill write this in the present tense  it makes it easier to describe.)

Little line,  of an inch or so, right up the left nostril  ahh, thats the stuff  I can feel myself starting to anticipate the effects. Drip tastes like hell. Even the act of snorting has already got my pulse up a bit. Im excited to see what this will be like.

I think I feel something, although it might just be psychosomatic. Upping of the heart rate, wanting of a cigarette. I go outside for a smoke and yep, there it is, that extra enjoyment of cigarettes thats accompanied most of my speed experiences. We go out for coffee and to go to the bank. Music is good, I like singing along.

Still slightly up, but thats all. Decide its time to do the rest. Two more little lines, ahhh. Went to get some water  some slight cotton-mouth at this point. Im offered cookies and realize that I have no appetite at all.

There it is! This high doesnt seem to sneak up on you like a speed high can  it was more sudden. At this point, it seemed pretty close to a fairly-high-dose amphetamine high  endless talking, always needing to do something productive. My friends were watching TV and I found it hard to just sit around, especially when they wouldnt let me talk while they were watching. (I should mention, by the way, that my friends were sober and therefore easily irritated by my babbling  kind of a buzzkill.) I was smiling, laughing, talking, telling jokes, relating random anecdotes. You get the picture. I was up for anything.

Good shit. Soooooooooo happy. I couldnt stop talking if my life depended on it. Went out for another smoke, but this time went to a park and sat on the swings and sang. I notice some enhancement of the senses: it seems I can see more clearly; things that I hear seem brighter, cleaner and sharper but also mellower (if that makes any sense) and my sense of touch is affected: everything from the cigarette between my lips to the breeze on my face is pleasurable. Im flying high, enjoying myself immensely, but with none of the jitters that come along with speed use. I can sing out loud and just enjoy the high. I never want to stop swinging and smoking and singing with the wind in my hair and the night so silent all around us. Life is perfect.

Driving around, looking for a restaurant thats open this late on New Years. No luck, but its fine  I dont want to eat anyway, but I do really want a smoke, so we stop. Ahhhits fucking bitterly cold, but its OK. Everything is amazing. It feels a lot like a speed high, but with a tiny extra tinge of sensory enhancement that really improves the experience. Im not getting any of the much-advertised empathy  likely because my friends are sober. The only thing even close to empathy is that I wish they would take some of this too  I want to be able to talk to someone about how good Im feeling and have them know what Im talking about. Not to mention that it isnt fun to repeatedly be told to shut the fuck up when talking is a truly pleasurable experience.

We end up at a Pizza Pizza. I wish we could drive around all night  Im singing along with the music, and the comfy seats in the car really allow me to lie back, close my eyes and realize how good life is, how amazing this night is, and how much fucking fun Im having. Mmmmm.

Back at my friends place to ring in 04. Her parents and some of their friends are there, and I can talk to them with ease. I have been noticing some mild teeth grinding/jaw clenching, which usually happens to me on speed anyway; Ive almost come to enjoy it for some reason. I got some gum, though, and a drink of water  I still have cottonmouth (again usual for me.) My body temperature seems high, and when I look in a mirror, my face is really quite red. Still flying high, enjoying every minute, but Im just past the peak.

Happy New Year! Lots of singing, jumping, hugging, yelling, the usual. Past peak, but still feeling great.

Were bored. Eventually, we get on the internet and start signing my friend up for gift registries at appliance stores. I enjoy this, though, because I can talk, and help, and organize, and think of ideas, all of which are immensely fun. The only problem from now on is going to be keeping my brain in check. You see, I absolutely dread crashing (which stems from one particularly bad crash) and now I tend to get worried while I should be enjoying myself (Uh oh, when will I start to come down? Maybe itll be soon. Oh my God, I think Im coming down, dammit, dammit, dammit) and it just goes downhill from there. So the challenge for me is to keep my mind elsewhere. I realize that I have some speed on me which I can boost with if I need to (although Id really rather not) and some lorazepam to put me out. That calms me down  I know that I dont have to face a crash if I dont want to, and I relax. Its always good to have some benzos or something on you whenever youre using stimulants, because even if you never have to take them, you know that youve always got a way out, a way to come down and sleep it off.

My heart rate is still through the roof. Were watching some movie that I dont understand, and Im not making any effort to do so  even thinking about random things is fun enough. I still have real cottonmouth and Im drinking lots of water. Im kind of surprised that Im still feeling positive effects  considering that I snorted it, I expected the duration to be on the short end of the 4-6 hr average time. Oh well, Ill cross the comedown bridge when I come to it.

My friends went to sleep, and I want to sleep as well. I can feel the effects tapering, I feel mellow and happy still, but it sort of comes in gentle waves  an oscillation, if you will, between the remaining mild mellow euphoria and a sense of mental and physical tiredness. I realize how much I want a cigarette, but no way can I sneak out of my friends parents house at quarter to four without one of her dogs waking the neighbourhood. I take 1mg of lorazepam in an attempt to bring me down a little bit  my pulse is still quite fast.

T=7:00 (4:15)

I feel a slight heaviness in my limbs, but not drowsiness, and my heart is still racing. I take another 0.5mg  I dont want to take very much because Im not going to end up getting much more than three hours of sleep, and I dont want to be a zombie in the morning. At this point, I believe that if I were to just stay up, the crash wouldnt be that bad  just a lessening of effects, and the resultant disappointment. But no  I need sleep. Im still a little up, though  Im sick of lying here doing nothing  I want to at least read a book, or check my email, or anything. I force myself to lie down, try to stop thinking entirely (not easy!) and try to sleep.

It took me until 5 AM to get to sleep, and when I did, I drifted in and out, dreaming weird dreams. When I woke up at 7:30, I wasnt sure that I had slept at all  the dreams seemed so strangely realistic. I needed a smoke and a coffee more than anything else in the world, so I threw a coat on over my pajamas and went out to the nearest coffee place (luckily it was open.) I felt heavy from the lorazepam but my heart rate was still quick  weird! It felt a bit weird to walk at first, but once I got out in the cool air, it got easier. The introduction of two cigarettes and a large black coffee into my system did me a world of good, although I still felt a little heavy, clumsy and a tad drowsy.

The drowsiness continued the rest of the day, but it was an enjoyable drowsiness, mellow, I settled into bed with a Calvin &amp; Hobbes book and felt great.

Overall, my first MDMA experience was an excellent one, and one to definitely be repeated in the future.</bodytext></report>
