The other day, while I was walking the street in Tel Aviv I saw a sign in a kiosk which stated 'fresh khat'. I've decided to buy some khat, I've paid 70 NIS (~15$ US) for a double dose of fresh stocks. The seller instructed me to cut off and chew only the young leaves at the tip of each stock. He told me to chew the leaves for 3 hours.

When I got home I've made a nice bundle of young leaves and chewed on it. Khat leaves are extremely bitter and create a terrible cotton-mouth.
/n
/n
T + 15m : no effect, just cotton mouth.
/n
/n
T + 45m : no effect, the leaves lost most of they're bitter taste 
/n
/n
T + 3h : no effect.

I've decided to make a strong tea from the stocks leftovers and the mature leaves. The leaves were boiled for 30 minutes in 3 liters of water (~3 quarts), the tea was then reduced to one cup. The tea was dark like black dye and was very very very bitter.
/n
/n
T + 4h : no effect, drank tea
/n
/n
T + 5h : no effect
/n
/n
At that point I called a friend of mine who recommended me to make some 'Khat lemonade'. The leaves were mixed with some lemonade in a blender.
/n
/n
T + 5h30m : no effect, drank Khat lemonade
/n
/n
T + 6h : no effect
/n

Because there was no effect I decided to meet a friend at the local coffee shop. We sat down and drank some coffee. After drinking a cup of coffee I became relaxed and felt more articulate than usual.
/n
The sensation was mellow and lasted for 2 hours. 
/n
/n
In conclusion: Khat was a waste of my money and time
