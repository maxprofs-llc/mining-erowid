For the past year I had experienced intense anxiety and not wanting to take something addictive like benzos, barbituates, etc., I set out on a quest to find something for relief. After much research I stumbled upon buspar. The next day I went to my doctor and just asked for it, she prescribed 5mg twice daily.

Now, the first two or three times I took it there was a noticeable dizzying effect for about 20 minutes, this subsided within a few dosages. After about a month I went and saw a psychiatrist who was better able to determine dosages, he upped it to 15 mg twice daily. Again, the dizziness started for the first couple times it took it. After about two weeks I noticed an extreme change in the amount and frequency of my anxiety, I can always tell when its been too long between my dosages. Many people say buspar does nothing, at least nothing good. I can't agree, it's all about finding the proper dosage and patience as with any other psychoactive.</bodytext></report>
