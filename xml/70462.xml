I hadn't rolled a joint in a long time, so I figured I should practice for the upcoming 4-20. I used catnip to practice, and a couple of them turned out so nice that I needed to smoke them. After I smoked them, my throat felt very smooth and my breath felt cold.

Keep in mind that catnip doesn't get you high. Get some skullcap if you're looking for a legal herbal high.</bodytext></report>
