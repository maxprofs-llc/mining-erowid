My mom was suffering from food poisoning and needed some medicine to help her out. So I ran down the dollar store and bought Benedryl, Nyquil, and Imodium. I have tripped on Benedryl before, and it felt amazing, as if I was floating. I picked up the medicine and went home. When I got back home, I took 5 Benedryl tablets, and sat at my computer getting ready to write this. Now, I'm feeling amazing. I feel like I'm stuck in space, in a vacuum, and just floating around. My muscles are relaxed, but a slight head ache. It's so hard to type right now. I'm seeing flying dots, and a rubber pad behind my computer screen, but they're aren't really there. A dog barked at me and I just freaked out. My experience is full of euphoria and muscle relaxation. The antihistamine feels godly. This is truly a flying experience, and the definition of euphoria.</bodytext></report>
