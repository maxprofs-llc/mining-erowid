Prep.: 
/n
The seeds are baked by placing a seed on top of a lit light bulb seems to work for me better than in a stove or any other. Seeds are crushed in a mortar and pestle to a very fine powder. Then seeds are mixed with baking soda and a bit of water. After placing the brown sludge over a lightbulb set in a lamp I waited. After the mix is completely dried I crush it again in the mortar and pestle. It is ready.

Setting and Mind Set:
/n
Sitting in my room very anxious. This would be my second yopo attempt first attempt was ill prepared and gave me all the bads without the goods. I sat there with well prepared powder in a medium sized line breathed in and out and dove in. One nostril, Two nostrils. Oh god it burns. I run into the bathroom and calm myself down.

In the bathroom staring at myself in the mirror. My Shower is on to calm me. The pain is intense but not anything i can't handle. My face is burning and drool is coming out of my mouth. I know that soon I will be vomiting. Correct, I am currently vomiting but the effects are starting to kick in so I really don't care my vomit actually looks neat in yopo vision and I'm staring at it.

The effects are now full blown there are many colors and if I close my eyes I can see a spirograph spinning out of control. I decide to take a shower just to experiment it is very relaxing and to my surprise i notice all feelings have become simply feelings. It was like if I feel pain and I tell myself that it is all in my mind. All feelings did not feel good or bad they were just feelings. Moving around is also very easy.

The effects start to change. Now there are transparent planes All over my room. It looks like there are windows all over my room. Also my room is green.

My ceiling is moving and there are transparent tentacles coming out of my ceiling light. There are also geometric patterns all over the ceiling they look very fancy.

I look up at three dots on the ceiling and realize that this must be how people made up star constellations. These three dots make up a horses face but look nothing like a horse without the yopo.

All in all this was a great experience and I can't wait to try again with lime in the mix. A word of advice is when this stuff is in your nose don't breath in through your nose and blow the stuff out when it starts to take effect.</bodytext></report>
