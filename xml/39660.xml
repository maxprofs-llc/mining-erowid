It all started in mid November 2004. Being in study period with nothing to do, I decided to leave with my friend Neil to drink some beers at his house.  Neil offered me some marijuana but I declined seeing as that I was being drug tested.  When we arrived at his house, Neil smoked a few bowls of his weed and I drank about five beers. We returned to school after the festivities were over and commenced to go to last period. I remained drunk until I got on the bus to go home.  My friend John asked me if I wanted to chill at his house after school.  I got off the bus at his house.

While at his house, I learned he had an assortment of various drugs available.  I snorted 60mg of Adderall to try and sober me up so that I could call and tell my parents my plans for the evening.  After I called them, John told me that his brother was growing an 'Angels Trumpet' plant in the basement.  Supposedly, it would make you trip for three days.  We went down to the basement.  I ate three leaves, John ate about two.

We put on a movie waiting for the trip to start.  About one hour into the movie, I started to feel very tired, almost as if I were to fall asleep.  We stood up and stopped the movie and attempted to get something to eat.  I noticed that my motor skills were severely affected as I would reach out to touch the door and it would take me several attempts before actually reaching the knob.  I went to the bathroom to piss.  I looked in the mirror and saw that my pupils were very dilated.  I went out to tell John the exciting news about my pupils and he looked at me and started laughing.

We went up to his room to play video games.  I tried to race the car but I kept crashing into walls and other cars.  At one point his sister came into the room.  Seeing as I had never met her before, I introduced myself to her in the best of my ability.  Soon after this, I blacked out.

My friend Chris, who does not use drugs, had just gotten out of work and came over to John's house to hang out.  All memories from here on are told to me by Chris because I do not remember.  John's mother came home and asked me if I wanted something to eat.  I quickly said no in a panicked way.  I kept calling his mother Mrs. Anderson even though John's last name is not Anderson.  We decided that I was too fucked up to be at John's house so we went out and hung around Chris' car.

I told John and Chris that I was going to look for my locker in the woods.  They advised me against it seeing as we were not at school.  At this point, I remember my hallucination.  I was at my school, everyone had pale white clothes on, and pale grey skin.  The school was black and white.  My friend Drew, who used to be the drummer in my band, was the prevalent person that I remember from this hallucination.  Chris told me that as we were standing around his car, I was attempting to change the oil in my father's car which was not there.  We all got in his car, which was really there, and decided to go to the mall.

On the way to the mall, while I was caressing the leather seats, we were stopped by the police.  Apparently, one of John's neighbors had called the cops after observing me wandering in their back yard in a delusional fashion.  The cops brought me down to the station.  I somewhat remember being in the back of the police car and trying to stick my finger through the metal grating.  The police called my parents and they came down to the station.  While they were there, I almost wandered into the road and got hit by a car. My parents brought me home.

I don't remember the ride home.  I do remember when I got home, my father punched me in the face and was trying to get out of me what drugs I had taken.  I told him I had to take a piss in the woods, walked down the porch stairs about five steps, and turned around and came back in.  My father asked why I hadn't gone to the bathroom and I got confrontational with him saying that I did.

My mother was on the phone frantically trying to get from Chris what drugs I had taken.  I remember looking over at the cabinet and seeing stacks and stacks of cereal boxes.  I was also talking to people who weren't there in a frantic manner, and picking pieces of dog hair off the floor and playing with them and putting them back down.  Eventually I muttered 'angel's trumpet'.  My father, having read a book on brugmansia and other hallucinogenic plants in college, decided that I needed to be brought to the hospital.

I don't remember much of the ride to the hospital.  I was trying to communicate with my parents, having forgotten once again that I had taken any drugs.  I remember that after everything I had said, my mother would say things like 'What the fuck?'.

When I arrived at the hospital, I was hallucinating wildly.  John's parents are doctors.  While I was laying on the hospital bed, I thought I was in John's parents' bedroom taking a nap.  The doctors were asking me if I had taken any drugs that day, I said no.  My parents told me I was reciting things to them such as how to solve related rate problems in calculus and the chemical structure for glucose.  I remember I was hallucinating that my calculus notes were written on the hospital curtain because of the strange patterns that were there.  I also told my father that my blood was neon red because of the heart monitor on my finger.

The doctors finally injected me with glucose and a chemical to counteract the brugmansia.  I stopped hallucinating and woke up in the bed thinking I was getting my wisdom teeth taken out.  I spent all night in the hospital with my mother saying foolish things such as, 'I need to go to the bathroom in the woods.'

The hallucinations continued throughout the morning on the way home from the hospital.  The road signs' letters kept rearranging and changing.  Eventually that night, the hallucinations finally diminished almost completely.

In conclusion, Brugmansia fucked with my head.  I know I'll never do it again.</bodytext></report>
