At 10:30 am this morning I began to grind and consume what would be 10 nutmeg nuts. I put 1  nuts into hot water and milk with lots of sugar. I began to drink it. It was disgusting. It wasnt so much the taste that I couldnt stand just the feeling that I was going to throw up a few seconds after it reached my stomach. With this method of ingestion I decided to bomb the rest of the nutmeg (wrap the powder in rolling papers and swallow them like capsules).
