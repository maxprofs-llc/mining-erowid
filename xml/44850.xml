For the past 2 months I have been taking 6 mg Zyprexa and 25 mg Prozac under the name Symbyax daily. I have taken mushrooms before, but never while on Symbyax. Tonight I ate one gram of powerful mushrooms with no effects after 4 hours. I did some research and found a report of a person eating 8 g of cubensis mushrooms while on Zyprexa with no effects.

Everybody may be different, but if you are taking a mood stabilizer, you may want to think twice about wasting your money on mushrooms.</bodytext></report>
