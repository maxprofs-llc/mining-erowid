  At 2:00PM today, approximately 20mg. of 4-Acotoxy-DET was taken orally. I then sat down to watch the last half hour of an MST3K episode. As the program ended and the material came on I began to have doubts as to the soundness of my decision. I had originally intended to try out some 5MeO-AMT, but was not quite up for such a lengthy experience. In fact, I was in a downright pissy mood from lack of sleep and an unusually strong suffering of allergies. But as it was the last day of a four day weekend for me, and I had been puting this off for days, I decided to give the 4-Aco another try. Previous experiments of up to 30mg had been positive.

  At this point I opted to settle down and watch the movie 'Dark City,' a groovy flick which I had not seen in some time. As I watched this I noticed that I was put off by the baseness of most of the characters in the film. I thought that perhaps these people had gotten what was coming to them due to their crude natures. By the end of the film (T+2hrs) it seemed that I was only having a rather moderate experience. I pondered the idea of re-dosing, but chose to ride it out as it was.

  As I sat wondering what to do next I entered into a very strange and philisophical frame of mind. The Acetoxy suddenly seemed to ramp up, and I found myself examining some very basic and yet complex ideas regarding human nature. The concept of what is right and wrong, of the battle between need and desire. Of course, these are the questions which have plagued mankind for ages. I felt the need to listen to Garbage's 'Version 2.0' album now.

  As soon as I realized that there was really no rational explanation or answer to these questions I began to focus on the bridge between reason and unreason, or between reason and knowledge. It became clear to me that music was the key to this. Music, stronger than any drug and greater than any aphrodesiac. One doesn't even need to hear music to feel its' power. All that is needed is a single memory of it, capable of transcending all boundaries and infinitely flexible. I should make it clear here that I am using music as a trick. The real purpose of it is to distract ones' reason away from the subject at hand, thus allowing the bulk of ones' energy to go to work on a silent solution to the problem. I could just as well substitute the term 'music' with any number of things, so long as it serves the same purpose.

  By the end of the Garbage tape I was quite aware of the extraordinary sense of time dilation which I had previousely noted with this compound. Much stronger than with any other substance I've encountered. In fact, I would say that this is the most striking aspect of this material. It was hard to feel how much time had just passed, perhaps several hours it seemed. I decided My Bloody Valentine's 'Loveless' would be a suitable follow-up. During this time I came to a conclusion that had only been hinted at before. Nitrous + 4-Aco = pure heaven. I could swear that several hours had passed by the end of this 48 minute CD.

   T + 4 hours: still going fairly strong. The idea of introducing Salvia Divinorum into the mix came up. I soon entered into a very strange dilemma. While a part of me very much wanted to try this, I was confronted with a strange fear. I examined it and realized what it was. I was afraid that Salvia would alter my mood so much that it would turn me back onto the dark side. My previous two entheogen experiences with DPT and 2C-I were of a very dark nature, though nonetheless enlightening. However, I did not feel up to such a journey at this time. Or perhaps I just did not want to risk endangering the highly positive mood I had entered into. I then began to feel a sense of regret and even an accusation from the spirit of Salvia, and entered into a pseudo-salvia experience.

  I should pause here to make a digression about my relationship with Salvia Divinorum. I have no way of predicting when I will meet with Sally. It's not something that can be planned for. It is rather a matter of 'when Sally comes calling, you'd better answer.' I found myself making what I felt to be rather lame excuses, saying 'no, please...not now. Later...I swear. I love you. I miss you.' I'm sure this sounds very strange, but my feelings toward Salvia are more like the love one would have for another human being than like the love one may have for any other 'substance' or object. Before I met Sally I had no idea that such a human-plant relationship was possible. Though I had heard of such things, it had remained more a matter of myth and science-fiction than reality. I am now humbled by the living myth.

  What followed was rather akin to a series of negotiations between Sally and myself. If one does not respond to the call of Salvia in a timely manner, one risks severing the relationship in a permanent sense. Thus the need for a compromise, which took the form of the certainty that I will be meeting Sally on her own terms very soon. I could not help but feel that I had already entered Salvia space without having to even physically commune with it. This pseudo-Salvia experience lasted for about an hour, and I was left with the clear feeling that 4-Acetoxy-DET had indeed met with Salvia Divinorum and that they had departed as friends.

  T + 6 hours: coming down fast. Only thing left to do is listen to another CD and write this report. No nausea was experienced at all during this encounter. No negative effects whatsoever, except perhaps for some minor teeth-grinding. Overall I would call this a solid + 3 event. Oh, and I almost forgot---I had taken 1600mg of Piracetam one hour before takeoff. I now suspect this had something to do with the unusual upsurge in intensity at the T + 2hour point.</bodytext></report>
