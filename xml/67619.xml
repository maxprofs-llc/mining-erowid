I was inhaling nitrous (sic) from a dust remover can while my friend played Guitar Hero. He was really engrossed in the game, and I kept holding the nitrous (sic) in longer and longer. Finally I dissociated so bad that I went blind, forgot how to breathe, and passed out.

When I came to I had a mild concussion and a bump on the back of my head the size of a grapefruit. I had to go to the hospital, couldn't sleep for days... Please learn from this story and be careful when you do shit like this, alright? Especially don't stand up on a concrete floor.</bodytext></report>
