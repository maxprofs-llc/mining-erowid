I smoked 120mg, to see, what it's like. The Effects started to work immediatly after smoking, but they became much stronger in the next 30 Minutes.

I felt really good, I was talking very fast and much. I've only seen some people talk that much, when they were on MDMA. But, with every Oil-Joint I smoked, the Flash was getting more weird. And the Beer did his Job better than everytime before.

When I closed my Eyes, I saw strange imitations of Reality and talking was very difficult.

I felt some bad Rush coming up and I was very tired, so I went to sleep a little. In the Morning after I woke up and was still a little bit stoned, but I felt very well.

I tried some smaller doses and it was also pleasant, but not so intesive. After all, I like smoke Sceletium sometimes in small dosages, and i like it!</bodytext></report>
