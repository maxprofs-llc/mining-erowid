I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but once I entered high school it got worse than I had ever imagined. I started to self medicate, the best thing I ever found was my step mothers xanax.

I started with just two .5mg but I loved the feeling so much that I soon ended up taking up to six pills (3.5mg) it made every breath completely fullfilling, and each touch gental and comfurting. my head always felt empty, not only was I extremly light headed, but my anxiety was gone and I just simply wasnt thinking.

I dont know how I would have gotten through high school without xanax</bodytext></report>
