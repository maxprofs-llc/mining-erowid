Well, yesterday was quite a day I must say, while hanging out at my good buddy's house with a couple of friends, had connections for the YAY. So, my friend BA and I bought a half a gram off the guy, and everyone in that room that day had been chattering about the purity level being at a high percentage. This being my first time doing the drug, I always express a caution level with waters I am unsure of especially with manmade drugs, considering that if you dont know the source.

+30-60 mins later: the high had faded, it almost felt like the energy that was so moving, so gripping had just been cruely and tyrannicaly stripped from my body. My mind cried out to my body, it wasnt so much a ravenous hunger as it was just a hunger to keep that wonderous high going and going ...</bodytext></report>
