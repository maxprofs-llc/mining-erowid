I've been using this substance consistently for well over a year, in the form of 750 mg capsules assumed more or less evenly spaced during the day. Its effects (enhanced memory, anxiolysis) became noticeable in around 3-4 weeks from the onset of administration. This is no placebo effect: I can tell that it really works, unlike most other purported 'nootropics'. I'm a university student and even though my memory was already above average to begin with, I noticed a definite improvement. I also noticed being less nervous in social situations. Feels like a benign drug.</bodytext></report>
