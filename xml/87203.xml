'Sunday, March 22 - 2009'
/n
so i haven't lit since 
/n
election night
/n
=========================================
/n
I was baptized under the showerhead
/n
I was sewn upon the ground
/n
/n
there is not one moment with you that i do not receive
/n
some intimate information about my nature or what my body is requesting
/n
the in in in in's are beginning to shuffle mmm wmmm mm
/n
/n
it is god's garden,
/n
it's the angel's hedgerows
/n
/n
it spurs me with dense rushes telling me to stay from technology
/n
this time I'll break it
/n
it shows me my placement from all surrounding angles
/n
=====================================================
/n
it gives me a new eye for the natural world
/n
like a dead man usurping an infant's face to view a field once again
/n
it is lifting oneself out of Hades in order to vview the bluue pink and yellow once morre
/n
the smile carries it out
/n
and Mephistopheles or whoever pulls you back in again
/n
-=================--=================----
/n
it disarms and de-panels the ideal
/n
like blown solar plates
/n
it is the satellite of the world
/n
you'll stay in the dark room and still hear the static telepathy
/n
you'll still feel the hot sun like it's being sent back in on a discus of light
/n
--------------------------------====
/n
it inspires capitulation
/n
it is a one-word judgment without malice,
/n
 just peeeeeeling the answers back
/n
 like a sticker's back
/n
it is understanding all
/n
-----===========================
/n
it is turning my body to thousands of leaves twistling down and off a tree's bark
/n
it is becoming the leaf-pile and being blown into liquid propeller leaves
/n
it is all of fall's colours surrounded with deep lush greens
/n
it is the palm frond cocoon
/n
set at perfect temperature
/n
it is 'WHAT IS IT THAT REALLY MATTERS?' in Hollywood's best god voice
/n
and recognizing that is a new sensation in the skin
/n
/n
----------------------------===
/n
-------my whole
/n
 system is ------------===
/n
reporting--------------------------------==
/n
----------------------==
/n
-----===
/n
----------------==
/n
/n
it is nature's last defense against the unnatural
/n
it's the ghost in the highway
/n
it is the manual (instructions)
/n
shifting to manual (setting)
/n
/n
it is the ever-reclining race car
/n
the roller-coaster network of neurons
/n
it is the limb-loggering high-jump
/n
/n
it is a warm vat for the satyr
/n
it is the lei garland necklace that you get off the plane in Hawaii
/n
/n
it is the ecstatic, imperfect mess
/n
spliced frames
/n
unsequenced until you can cut-and-paste the moments and truly live them
/n
not reading the instructions to the nerves and cells
/n
/n
all in-between thoughts have been banished for the constant flourish
/n
it is a tactile heaven gym-court
/n
know that you don't
/n
have to live five seconds in the future of each fragment
/n
/n
it is all the drapery being shook and thrown off and down the street
/n
IT IS THE FIRE WITH THE FINGER SNAP.
/n
it is placing your mind in the CD tray ----and ACTUALLY GETTING TO LISTEN.-----
/n
----------------------------------------------------------------------------============
/n
===============================================================================
/n
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------========
/n
realizing there are more channels devoted to you than you can ever flip the cards on
/n
/n
it is that touch-and-go foreign language you keep threatening to invent
/n
it's getting a brand new bellows to breathe with
/n
stomping down stairs by the stained glass 
/n
up by the church organ
/n
and it's knowing EXACTLY how to play that church organ
/n
 and getting to play it your way at 7am for a well-lit church congregation
/n
taking the top down off of the cathedral
/n
then being seated at a plate
/n
 of sunny side up eggs afterward
/n
all yellow and white
/n
just like me 
/n
because I'm pure
/n
AM I? mostly
/n
/n
it is knowing the music-tracks on every incense stick 
/n
and smiling knowingly to your friend
/n
when you come across it in your record collection
/n
it means getting to share that laugh, 
/n
knowing you're both in two completely different places
/n
 grabbing hands over great distances
/n
/n
it is a profound thought
/n
 being served to you every day at the same time
/n
in your cranberry purple, yellow-covered reform school
/n
it is every noon a school class trip
/n
to some fond, vague, Austrian meadowland
/n
you'll be seated upfront
/n
with your pupils pushed back
/n
/n
leaping at lilies like cheap puppets
/n
'SHOWING THE DOG HIS OWN FACE'
/n
/n
it is the wood of the cabin and
/n
THE TORSION OF THE SLUG HEADING DOWN THE STEEL
/n
with no salt around
/n
------------=====================---------------
/n
all blue green now
/n
its the cut leather swaying on native clothing
/n
the gentle breeze
/n
--------------============--------------
/n
it is the nerve-ending dance which no composer has written for yet
/n
no one has tried
/n
then you realize nothing decent has been done yet
/n
  BUT IIT WIILLL!
/n
/n
it is getting to swim in the crystal lake with its light-red-yellow-blue divers and
/n
gemmed stalactites
/n
/n
it is the whole wealth of personalities known
/n
at your fondest perusal
/n
it is 'REMEMBER THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE THAT YOU NEVER LOVED?'
/n
it is falling on your back on your seat letting nerves charge
/n
electrified in jolts
/n
it is letting things fly at full mast
/n
it is getting the soul's autograph and going home on the bus of life happy
/n
it is foot-peddling the ceiling like an infant
/n
rolling-ovrrr like a bohemian jaguar right after a rest in the jungle's core
/n
/n
is it sparking all the kindling on the smile
/n
it is fine ways of transmitting insights into humanity
/n
/n
it's moving like you can breathe underwater
/n
/n
IT IS THE FROSTY BOB-SLED RUN OUT
/n
                  into the verdant valley
/n
it is more fun than you can record
/n
far better than any mass experience
/n
/n
===============================================--------=============----------
/n
--------------=================---------------==============--------------=========
/n
it is always telling you to leap to your feet
/n
fall back into a pillow if you want to have a downtime
/n
/n
you'll find it's also all the stripes on the pillow come off on your back
/n
it is all those psychedelic viewfinders from childhood
/n
slights of the optics
/n
/n
thrills from those magic eye posters
/n
with the hidden image that none of the teachers could see
/n
or a magic mirror which reflects us all
/n
/n
it is the third-eye chromatrope
/n
it is visionary company
/n
============================================--------==================
/n
/n
it is the prismatic train taking looonnnng leeeaaaps off the track
/n
taking higher strides each time
/n
/n
it is anything that prevents your father from talking
/n
it is the FF&gt;&gt; wedding to post-ritual speech
/n
it is leaping on the plush chair savage-like
/n
and throwing a leg over it carelessly like an angel on a tuft of cloud
/n
it is stretching your legs and doing chores that would've bored you
/n
exercises that can't begin to exert you
/n
art that spindles out of you in a daze
/n
part of the nameless, but 
/n
un-ashed hours
/n
========================================
/n
----------------------------------------
/n
it is nothing like its been made out to be
/n
you should be ashamed of calling it anything but what it is
/n
it's bedfeathers without concerns,
/n
it is a re-connector...</bodytext></report>
