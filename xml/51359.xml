I found a good way to ingest morning glories; I used this when I experimented with the seeds.   At first a friend and I sat down with an ounce of untreated seeds and began chewing small 'pinches' thoroughly and swallowing.   This was fine at first, but after about 200 seeds the taste was unbearable, I would have puked if had chewed any more.

My friend, who is obviously much tougher than I am, finished his half ounce in one sitting without mixing them.  An hour later he began his trip and felt nothing but

nausea.  I knew I had to finish the other quarter ounce that was left for me to get to his level.  So, I ground the seeds in a grinder until they were mostly powder and then poured a double shot of V8 bold and spicy.

I then poured the powdered seeds on top of the 'double shot' and slammed it down.

The V8 was so thick and overwhelming that I couldn't even taste or feel the texture of the seeds.  The end result:  an hour later I was up there with him and we spent the evening tripping out of minds.  It was a great experience.  Next time I'm not even messing around with chewing the seeds.I'll just make up several V8/seed shots and ingest it that way.</bodytext></report>
