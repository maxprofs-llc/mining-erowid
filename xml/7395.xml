Like curtains of raindrops falling down
/n
Each glittering jewel a twinkling sound
/n
your love sweeps upon me
/n
within me
/n
without
/n
A breath of deadly beauty
/n
And conciousness therein
/n
You glitter and shine
/n
And turn inside out
/n
these selves that are calling my soul to come out
/n
A sweet breath is blowing my soul into fire
/n
My body is dying so that I might go higher
/n
Into the void I now burst anew
/n
The celestial creatures a blessing bestow
/n
On my selfless dying and comedy show
/n
The same experience a friend once had
/n
to wander through the heavens
/n
to experience the riddle of the universe
/n
to remember what you forgot
/n
to know who you are
/n
to know you've come so far
/n
to know your soul's evolution is infinite
/n
to be ordered to say your piece of the puzzle
/n
that is the fathomless mystery 
/n
that is the universe within us
/n
to feel divine love ravage our body
/n
and turn every cell inside out
/n
to feel your bones ache
/n
and know that one day your body will die
/n
to know what will be left behind
/n
to go beyond the door
/n
that is guarded by the image of our self
/n
to sacrifice this image so we may be born anew
/n
well my friend said he did not know what to do 
/n
when he came back and had to talk to me and you
/n
but he was very humble that friend of mine
/n
who had sacrificed his body
/n
to witness the mysteries of time
/n
just imagine
/n
just imagine being a limitless being
/n
constantly imaging itself
/n
constantly getting to know itself
/n
constantly making love to itself
/n
constantly suprised
/n
and constantly being alarmed by itself
/n
constantly enchanted by itself
/n
constantly dying and constantly being born
/n
constantly mended and constantly torn
/n
constantly crying
/n
and constantly laughing at us
/n
the myriad lifeforms that inhabit it
/n
that are it
/n
that are its eyes and ears
/n
And after all this I hear an angel's astonished shout
/n
does it really fucking matter
/n
who we think we are
/n
does it really fucking matter if the Jones have a bigger car
/n
does it really fucking matter 
/n
if someone beats you up
/n
does it really fucking matter
/n
if you live in a rubbish bin
/n
when such truly timeless beauty
/n
can be found within</bodytext></report>
