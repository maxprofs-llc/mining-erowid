I just got my first job, as a fragrance rep, and it's got me nervous as hell. While I am, in many cases, hella smooth in my interactions with people, I'm also often extremely uncomfortable during said interactions. The point of this little story is, I swiped some of my dear mother's Neurontin, which she takes to help her sleep, before I went to work. (I told her I took some later; she didn't mind a bit.) I also took a 200 mg tablet of Modafinil, in case the Neurontin made me drowsy. It's just as well, because it turned out I quite mistaken regarding the average daily dose; I took 2400 mg, while the average dose is actually 900 to 1800 mg.

Everything turned out fine, though, due perhaps to the Modafinil in conjunction to my cursd naturally high tolerance to nearly every drug I've ever encountered. I was relaxed, confident, and (if I may say so myself) damn smooth all day long. I enjoyed myself so much that work began to feel almost like a game.</bodytext></report>
