Sitting in a big high-backed upholstered chair in a dark room.  Have five previous break-through experiences with this plant.  Took 1/2 gram of Oaxacan Salvia Divinorum in one lungful out of a large glass pipe.  Held it in for probably twenty seconds before exhaling.  Closed my eyes.

Everything's black except for something grey in front of me, which starts to move and after a few seconds I can tell that it is some sort of windmill-like object, with about a dozen flat blades turning together.  It's composed out of the same material as everything in my surroundings which is some sort of featureless black void.

I think 'What is that?' and it feels the same as it would have if I'd said it out loud.  As soon as I ask the question I feel myself being pushed forward but remaining in a seated position.  I glide forwards for a few seconds and then take a turn sharply to the right.  I look down and realize that I'm on some sort of a track that's being powered by the rotating blades I'd seen before.  I'm speeding up and I ask 'Who's doing this?' in the same sort of strange think-speech as before and immediately receive a response in the same non-verbal style, but it doesn't translate into language when I hear it.  All I get is the sense of an obviously feminine presence who is laughing LOUDLY into my head from just behind me.  I receive a strong mental image of a skinny black figure with long rubbery fingers and no facial features save two large round white eyes doing the pushing.

The track slows down and reverses direction.  The thing behind me is gone, presumably because I'm moving backwards now.  It goes like this for a while - forwards, backwards, left, right, sometimes going in one direction for a long while and sometimes changing direction pretty rapidly.  Then I started to get a physical sensation equivalent to being dragged facedown in loose gravel.  Very unpleasant.  I immediately identify the source of this discomfort which is a male presence who is similarly laughing at me.  He's dressed in some strange clothing but he's all squiggly black ink underneath just like the first one.

I figured I had a pretty good idea what was going on at this point, so I put an end to it.  Brought the weird trolley to a stop by willfully manipulating and reducing my sensation of movement so as to slow down and then stop entirely (just seemed like the natural thing to do) and then made a fairly loud mental statement which had no words but I think attempted to convey the statement 'Get out of my territory, this is my house, you're not welcome, don't make me angry' and waited in silence for a few seconds while they slowly receded until I couldn't sense them in the room anymore.

Strange stuff.  No benevolent feelings at all from anything around or anything useful taken out of this experience - have a weird kind of feeling like I was waylaid while looking for a teacher by a couple of delinquent entities.  I did show them who was boss around here, though, which I'm sure I'll keep as a point of pride for a good long while to come.</bodytext></report>
