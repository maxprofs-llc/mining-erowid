I had some capsules containg very little pills of morphine. Each capsule was 100mg. Since I heard eating morphine wastes most of it since it gets destroyed in your liver but I'm not into shooting, I decided to snort some crushed up pills.

I had done some dihydrocodeine and codeine before, each time about 200mg-250mg and had drunk some poppy tea for about half a year. But because I ran out of opiates this morphine would be the first opiate since about 3 weeks, so I thought my tolerance should have dropped a lot. Someone told me I should start with 12.5mg and to take another 12.5mg if necessary.

I opened one capsule and crushed those little pills to a fine powder. I devided the powder in 8 parts (each 12.5mg) and snorted one. I had thought the effects would kick in immediately like it is with amphetamines, but for the first 10minutes I felt nothing. I was a bit disappointed and snorted another 12.5mg in T+15mins. About 10mins later I began to feel a light opiate feeling coming up, but nowhere near the effects of a strong poppy tea.

The feelings intensified a bit and I sat down and read some comics. After about 1hour I took another 12.5mg and another 1.5hours later another 12.5mg.  I would compare my feels to 200mg of codeine without that red face and itching stuff. Not as good as I expected but it was okay.

I decided to go to bed, since I felt like coming down. Each time I do opiates I can hardly fall asleep. I lay in my bed half dreaming half awake, but I like that. Mostly I really fall asleep after about an hour, but this time I was in this dreamlike state for about 3 hours.

When I woke up the next day, I still felt the morphine, even my pupils were still small. Perhaps there was some kind of time-release working, despite the fact I crushed and snorted the pills. That would make it understandable why the effects weren't that good but lasted that long.

I will try eating some morphine next time, it is a waste but I have plenty of them, so I think I'll try about 60-75mg orally.</bodytext></report>
