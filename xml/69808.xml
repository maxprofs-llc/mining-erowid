I had never tripped on DXM before this experience.

My friend, whom I'll name R, had suggested to me that we trip on DXM. Before this was suggested to me, I had mixed 35g of nutmeg in orange juice and drank it.  5 hours later we got Robotussin and we each swallowed 330 mg. It tasted gross but I got over that fact. We spent about 45 minutes in my friend's room listening to Of Montreal waiting for the DXM to kick in, at this time I still didn't feel the nutmeg. After that 45 minutes we smoked a bowl of nug to combat the stomaches we were both experiencing. The cannabis helped a lot in getting rid of the stomachache.

After about another hour or so I started to feel the DXM and felt kind of like jelly. My friend suggested that I watch the visualizer on his computer and as I did I fell into a sort of trance. During that time I didn't really think anything at all, I was just amazed at the vizualizer. I turned back to look at my friend and he was just laying on his bed not saying anything so I decided to lay on the floor with a blanket. As I stayed there my vision started to spin and I fell into my body.

I don't know exactly how long I layed there but after awhile the spinning made my stomach turn and as I tried to get up I found it very difficult to do so but eventually I found a bucket in his room and threw up three times. I would have to say that this was the best part of the trip. Throwing up felt like a release of a horrible sickness. So then I lay back down and fall into my body once again, everything is still spinning. R tried to get me to get up, but I told him I couldn't, which at that moment I felt as though I'd never get up again.

I don't remember much after that and I eventually fell asleep. Overall I'd have to say it wasn't a very fun trip, the easiest way to put how I felt is I was messed up beyond belief. I probably will never try DXM again, or at least not with nutmeg. Since then I haven't taken nutmeg either.</bodytext></report>
