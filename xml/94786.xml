I was feeling anxious. I was anticipating an experience. Just not sure which type.

I heated the three seeds in a pan until they 'popped' and then de-husked them. I ground up three seeds and loaded just over half of it into a water pipe with a little bit of cannabis.

Immediately I felt a headache feeling...and then a pressure that led to nausea. Then the a very familiar body feeling not unlike DMT.
