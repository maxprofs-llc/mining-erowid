This is a summary/amalgamation of the three experiences I've had with this combination, which is, for me at least, one of the more powerful and insightful ones I've experienced.  It should be stated for the record that I am somewhat of a psychedelic lightweight, particularly, as is the case in this report, in those settings that are quiet, dark, and solitary.

T+0:00 Ingest 10-12mg 2C-I

T+0:30 Alerts.  Energy emanating from stomach and pulsing through the body.

T+1:00-2:00 Come up and plateau at a lucid ++.  Concentration is sharp and doing an activity like painting or playing music is particularly enjoyable.  This is very much a working level for me, I could go out and interact with the world if I so choose.  There isn't a whole lot of introspection or cosmic thoughts.  I am very much in my body and mind.  But somehow more lucid.

T+2:00 Hours 2-4 are typically the peak for me on 2C-I, so here is a good time to take some DPT.  I insufflate 25mg split into two lines, one in each nostril right after the other.  The burn is present but not too bad, which is more than I can say for the drip that comes 10 or 15 minutes later.

T+2:15 Maybe its the disgusting chemical taste dripping down the back of my throat, but I can start to feel something else come on.  Its kind of fog-like.  The world slowly stops making quite as much sense.  Concepts like people, object, and ideas begin to lose their saliency.  Now is a good time to find a comfortable place to lay down for the next hour or two.

T+2:30-3:30 Wild psychedelic journey.  The world melts to reveal the energetic building blocks that, under normal cognitive operation, are formed into meaningful ideas that can be communicated linguistically.  Now, however, everything exists is broad, colorful, infinitely layered gestures.  I can literally SEE the quantum foam of particles blinking in and out of existence that constitutes the universe.  Brilliant fractal visuals of cool metallic tones dance across my field of vision.

How long have I been like this?  How long will I be like this?  How can that even matter when right this very second is so unbelievably beautiful that I can barely keep my jaw in its usual unslacked position.  I can get up and walk around the room, but it is a room (and a body) that is vastly different from anything I had conceived of up until this point.  My place in the universe is like that of a water molecule bouncing between sticks and boulders in a mountain stream.  I don't know where we're going, I don't know why there's this force 'gravity' that pulls me and influences my motion, and I'm not sure I have any free will in choosing which boulder I will interact with, but for some reason, I don't really care.  If this is what the universe is, then I will gladly partake.

T+3:30-4:30 Begin to see traces of typical reality.  I can now, for instance, conceive of 'yesterday,' 'today,' and 'tomorrow.'  I have, however, no desire to rush back into these everyday concepts, so I sit back and bask in the light of the overarching metaphor (that being we are all connected and are, ostensibly, the same)
/n
/n
T+5:00 Slowly coming down.  Most of what I feel now is the 2C-I, but I am certainly still experiencing reverberations.  Because of the psycho-spiritual magnitude of what just happened, I can't say I am able to 'function' 'normally.'

T+7:00 Sleep restless.

This is truly a divine combination for me.  No drug, or combination of drugs up until this point has been this effective at blanking me out, reducing me to zero, to that which is essential.  I feel reborn after this.  A blank slate.  Childlike and primordial.  2C-I alone for me lacks the power, the penetration to really get me anywhere close to spiritual.  DPT alone is somewhat unpleasant, harsh, and awkward.  Together they provide a nice balance of the power, the raw psychedelic drive, and the lucidity, and helps retain the ability to put it all together.  This combo works equally as well with other 2C- compounds.  I have had an excellent experience with 25mg DPT at the tail end of a 14mg 2C-E trip.

I would imagine there is a lot of uncharted territory with higher doses, either with the 2C-I or DPT, but I have no desire to explore them, as this level was plenty for me to achieve what I am looking for.  Happy travels!</bodytext></report>
