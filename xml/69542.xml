A really good friend of mine recently took about 30mg of 5-MeO-AMT. It hit him within 15 minutes and while he was in a public place he caused a scene and had to be restrained by the police.
/n
/n
t + 1h: They took him to the cells. He was foaming at the mouth, unable to be communicated with and was throwing himself against the walls. 
/n
/n
t + 14: he lost consciousness and had to be taken into the intensive care unit and put on life support. 
/n
/n
t + 24: he was placed into a regular ward with possible kindey damage due to enzymes from his muscles clogging everything up.
/n
/n
t + 3d: he is still in the hospital, kidneys have gotten worse and we can't yet rule out brain damage at this point.
/n
/n
All he can remember is sitting in the car and the next thing he was in the hospital with a respirator.

Please take this as a warning...DO NOT TRY THIS DRUG! There are way better drugs out there which are far more safer. Give 5-MeO-AMT a miss.</bodytext></report>
