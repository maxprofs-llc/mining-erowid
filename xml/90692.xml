Because there is a lack of information on this new drug called 'jipper,' or Methoxetamine (which is a mouthful to say the least) I feel it will be beneficial to the community at large to write a report of some of the effects I have felt. I am neither a doctor, nor am I an expert on methoxetamine, or jipper so do not take what is written as factual. This is just my own experience.

I have found that jipper causes  confusion, euphoria, mania, ataxia, retrograde amnesia, anterograde amnesia, laughing fits, tactile sensations of pins and needles, closed eye hallucinations, lowering of inhibitions, poor judgment, sounds appearing muffled, increased appreciation of music, and decreased libido.

I have found that sublingual dosing is stronger versus intranasal dosing. The primary effects take about an hour to manifest themselves and persist for three to four hours, with after affects lasting into the next day. The hangover aspect is confusion, fatigue, and dysphoria, but is manageable and seems to clear up within a day or so, after resting and eating healthily.

If I were to compare it to ketamine or pcp, I would say jipper is what happened if ketamine and pcp mated. As far as comparing effects, I would say based on my ketamine experiences, doing jipper is similar to ketamine but without the loss of self.</bodytext></report>
