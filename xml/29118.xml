I have used just about every 'smart drug' on the market.  I have tried Aniracetam, Oxiracetam, Piracetam, Hydergine. Also I have tried huperzine A, Ginko, Vinpotocene, Dmae, high-choline Lecethin, Acetyl-L-Carnitin, and tons over other  substances.  I think I have stumbled over the perfect combination.  Piracetam and its other analougs never seemed to do very much for me.  Hydergine allways seemed to give me the most noticeable results so I have decided to up my dosage to 9mg a day sublingually.

My current daily regimin is; 9mg of hydergine sublingually, 1500mg of Acetyl-L-Carnitine, 100mg of dmae, A multivitamin, an extra B-Complex vitamin, 420mg of choline (from soy lecethin), milk thistle for liver, and about 10 cups of green tea. This is the absolute most effective combination i have found for the money.  The green tea seems to make hydergine 100X more effective.  I am in another world when I take this combonation. I have incredible photographic memory, and it feels like I have transended to another level of conciousness.    I really like it and just wanted to share my experiances.</bodytext></report>
