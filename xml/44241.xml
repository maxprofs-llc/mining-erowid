I was at the beach in daylight and I was there with my newly ex boyfriend. While coming up I felt paranoid and insecure. I couldn't stop talking even though I felt babyish and annoying for doing it. I went for a walk to seperate myself and things got a little better.

Everything had a rainbow circumference to it, a pulsating gas-in-liquid effect but nothing too interesting. Seagulls were HUGE and very confusing. I found something which looked like a horse skull in the sand, but it must have really been a horseshoe crab. I was full of emotion and all the senses were enhanced: sand grains were large and grapefruit tasted so good I ate pieces which had sand on them.</bodytext></report>
