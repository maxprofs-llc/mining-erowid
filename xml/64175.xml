5.30 PM. I took 160 mg of bk-MBDB rectally in a gel cap. After 10 or so minutes I felt quite excited.

5: 40 I went for a walk onto the beach near where I live. It was pleasant to look at the seascapes. I felt than usually benign towards my fellow people. On the beach, old guys were playing with paper kites. I'd taken my camera and took a lot of photos -- anything that appealed. I wanted to get the look the place in my photos (that thought seemed very significant).

6:00 Felt the effects more strongly. I was certainly euphoric and somewhat on edge. In my mind, although I had had a somewhat trying day, I could see my problems form a distance.

6:30 Still walking, in the park, I realized that the effects were wearing... an hour or so. 
/n
/n
7:00 Got home and took another 200 mg. The effects were highly pleasurable. I watched some video clips and other things on my PC. 
/n
/n
8:00 Re-dose at 340 mg. Still excellent, hedonistic effects. 
/n
/n
10:00 Further re-dose of 260 mg. Even this dose was a highly effective. Afterwards I had no desire to redose, although I couldn't resist this one. Somehow with this drug, after dosing a few times, I reach a very satisfying stop -- an incessant sort of stimulant pleasure. (Its darker side is shown in hints of paranoia and a tendency to start think about trivial remarks as having too much significance. Over regular use would be negative.)

/n
11:30 AM  Finally got two hours sleep with aid of xanax and kava capsules. Fitfully slept for about 4 hours and awoke feeling uncoordinated but not too negative.

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Aftermath:
/n
I would hesitate to do this again for a while. Felt very tired and rained for two or three days. The total dose was too high.</bodytext></report>
