After having recently found myself drinking two liters of 'cola' every other night to alleviate depression symptoms I decided to go right to a natural source and purchased some ground kola nut.  Attempting to put them in a coffee maker resulted in disaster, but putting one part cola and 4 parts water in a sauce pan turned out a fragrant, pleasant tasting decoction which provided effects not unlike caffeine.

The major difference from tablet caffeine and caffeinated beverages is a distinct 'body buzz'.  I know the Kola Nut has kicked in when my back muscles start tensing up.  Not mentally stimulating at all.  I can understand why kola nuts have been chewed by laborers for hundreds of years.  Also dubbed and aphrodiasic, which doesn't surprise me at all.
