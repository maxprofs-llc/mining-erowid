Me and a friend went up north to see Foo Fighters play. The plane left at around 12 30pm so I got up around 10 30am. When we got up there we walked around the city and got a bite to eat then headed off to the concert. It was my first big stadium concert and I was extremely physically tired afterwards.

We met another friend who went and decided to go back to someones place for drinks. The original idea was to have a couple then grab a taxi back to our motel but we ended up staying up all night, getting drunk and sobering up all while awake.

It was after about 12 30pm on the second day that I started to feel funny. Whenever I sat down I would hear people talking really loudly to the side of me, and would see people running flat tack at me only to disappear when I looked at them. As we sat in the airport lounge on the way back I sat on the seat staring pretty much into space. I thought everyone in the entire airport was looking at me.

I really want to try it again, but for longer periods of time. I read somewhere that Mike Patton wrote the Faith No More song Caffiene during a sleep deprivation experiment, hopefully I can do something as cool as that.</bodytext></report>
