I woke up on a wendesday morning with nothing to do untill 2pm when I had to go to work. My boss is never there on wednesday so I decided to down some nutmeg before I went. Ive done nutmeg only once before with little effects. I first used about an oz of nutmeg in 3 cups of water boiled for an hour. I ended up with about a cup of liquid that I sweetened up with some sugar. It didnt taste all that bad. About an hour later I started to shovel down 16 grams of nutmeg which was aweful, I used my scale to make sure it was precise.

By noon I could start to feel pressure behind my eyes and I felt a little 'high'. Drank a beer then left for work.

The effects didnt change much till I went to work. I got to my place of employment, at a car wash, on time at 2 pm. An hour passed and still felt kinda high when I remembered I had extracted dxm out of 4 bottles of syrup. I thought my batch had got ruined and was scared to take it before but I figure at this point who cares. I put a little less then a quarter of the powder in a straw wrapper and washed it down with a pepsi.

By 4 could feel the dxm, I was dissociated and felt a good body high.

At 5 I looked in the mirror and my eyes were very very pink. I felt pretty buzzed and dissociated. My throat was starting to get a little numb.
/n

I got off at 5:30 and had lots of butterflies. I drove over to my brother's house and played some nintendo for a while. The dxm was really kicking in by this point and the nutmeg was noticable.

6:30 we start watching Family Guy. It may have been the funniest thing I have ever seen. I was laughing so hard I was in tears. Then we switched it to hot shots with Charlie Sheen. I could not stop laughing through the whole movie. At this point it felt like a heavy hash high and I cracked open another brew. I had to put it back in the fridge after one sip cause it made my cottonmouth worse then ever.

Nothing much different untill 9pm. We decide to go get some food before we go to a rap show downtown. It was all within walking distance. We get to the restaraunt and order our food and turn on the phoenix suns game on the tv next to us. I have never seen such a slow game of basketball in my entire life. We ate and took off to the show. 
/n
/n
We get there around 9:45 and not much was going on. Im pretty sure this was my peak on the nutmeg cause it felt like I was on the biggest rollercoaster in the world with all the butterflies in my tummy. I was on the sidewalk smoking a cigarette when I noticed all the cars driving real slow. But then I realized that they werent driving slow, everything was slow, people walking slow, music was slow, etc.. 
/n
/n
By 10 I started seeing stuff out of the corners of my eyes shifting around. I was trippin real hard and decided not to go inside the show cause it, quote 'looks like a lame halloween party in there' so we started to walk back down to my brother's house.
/n
/n
On the way back we saw his girlfriend driving down the road and got a ride with her and went to her place. We got there around 11 and I drank a sparks which cured my cottonmouth perfectly. We watched a movie and I fell asleep around 1am, thursday.
/n
/n
I woke up thursday at about 7:30am and felt wore out from the dxm i'm pretty sure. I got a ride back to my car on the otherside of town and went home.
/n
/n
I took a shower and called a friend who was gonna meet me so I could get a ride while my truck was being fixed. I brought it to the shop around 10 and walked to the smoke shop to buy some salvia and meet my friend. He gave me $50 and I gave him a mushroom chocolate I promised him. I walked inside the head shop around 11 and bought a pack of cigs and 21x salvia.
/n
/n
My buddy ate the mushroom chocolate and made me drive back to his house. He had a bottle of tussin that he let me drink. It was an 8oz bottle and I downed about 3/4 of it. He started trippin on the shrooms and he wanted to go do something so we go to the mountain to trip.
/n
/n
We get to the base of the mountain around 12:30pm and we start goin up on the rocks. I found climbing really hard cause of the dex so we just chilled on a large boulder overlooking the city. He was tellin me about how much lsd and mushrooms are alike and I looked up to the mountain and saw it getting bigger and bigger and bigger. 
/n
/n
We get down off the mountain around 2:15 and went to go buy more chocolates for later in the month, just stocking up you know. We went back to his house after and I cracked open the vial of salvia and loaded a small bowl in his bong. I took a rip and forgot how bad salvia sucked. It didnt help that I was dexing pretty good to. 
/n
/n
About an hour later I loaded another hit of salvia and I was close to peakin on the dxm. I took a bigger rip then the first time and held it till I couldnt hold it no more. As soon as I took another breath or fresh air I was trippin really hard. I had that feeling like I was being pushed down and couldnt talk I could just mumble. I laid on the couch and it felt like I was in some kind of ridiculous assembly line, then I suddenly snapped out of it.
/n
/n
We went outside and I jumped on the trampoline, well tried. I was uncoordinated as hell and tried a frontflip.. Bad idea, I overspun and went straight to my nose. It wasnt to bad though I didnt feel it, I was too messed up. 
/n
/n
We sat around for an hour and went downtown to get more nutmeg for tea and a grinder. This time we bought whole nutmegs and crushed it ourselves. We went downtown and I got a pita to eat. We went into a store and spent 20 bucks on a stupid pestle and mortar. We got back to his house around 7 and crushed about an oz of the nutmeg and put it in 4 cups of water boiled for an hour. We each got about a cup of tea and didnt taste to bad.
/n
/n
About 30 mins later I took another rip of salvia and we were watching ninja warrior. I had the most horrid feelin in my skin and said 'i cant move' my friend asked why and I didnt answer, I let the old chinese man sitting next to me explain while I went to get a cup of water.... Old chinese man??? What was going on?? I later found out that the old chinese man was the voice on ninja warrior and my sweater sitting next to me.

I went outside to smoke and the deck was moving up and down like a wave pool. 
/n
/n
Back inside now I took another salvia hit while watching a guy on tv get a wire stuck in his brain. I felt like it was happening to me and I was freaking out. Then it felt like I was being pinned on the floor by straps coming out of the corners of the room. 
/n
/n
I can say I hate salvia now. I smoked half that vial and ill probably smoke the rest haha. 
/n
/n
I left his house at 9:45pm not feeling anything from the nutmeg tea. I went back home still coming down off the dex. Now I sit here at 12:38am friday writing this out of insomnia and boredom, still not feeling the nutmeg tea. &gt;=(

It was a fun 2 days now I gotta rest up some so I can eat my mushroom chocolate on sunday. I love nutmeg. I hate salvia. I love dxm, and they all mix together perfectly. I suggest you give it a go if your crazy. But be careful the best way to die off drugs is by mixing them. I feel like crap now and i'll probably call in sick to work tomarrow but I would say it was worth it.
