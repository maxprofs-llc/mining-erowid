BACKGROUND: I was a heavy/chronic meth user for 6 years. I have been mostly sober for a year and a half, having used only a very small amount a couple of times during this period.

EXPERIENCE:
/n
I tried some 8 Ballz bath salt. I understand why people would use it as a legal alternative to meth, because it is probably the closest thing they will find. It causes the same 'amp' as coke and meth while still producing a similar mental high or euphoria as meth that I don't get from coke.

HOWEVER:
/n
The main problem I found with it is that I get pounding headaches immediately upon use that I don't get with meth. Also, I had serious restless leg syndrome, and was much more overheated/sweaty after using bath salts than meth. The good effects don't seem to last as long as meth's. And then of course there is the crash.

USE AGAIN?:
/n
I think the only way I would use this again is if I had a serious craving for meth and just needed to 'scratch the itch' and snort something similar.</bodytext></report>
