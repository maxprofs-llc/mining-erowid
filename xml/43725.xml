Some background: A friday night (friday the thirteenth) I had ordered a gram of powdered kanna from a reputable source that sold it for a very low price. I was having pretty low expectations, considering its cheapness. But a gram for less than 2 dollars, what is there to loose, right?

So anyway, it arrives in the mail a week before and during that week I had tried insufflating a small pinch of it, and got nothing but a small rush from snorting it. (snorting anything will give me a small rush) Insufflating was HORRIBLE, because of the foul tasting substance that kept dripping down my throat from my nose. I tried smoking it a few times, along with some Damiana leaves. I got nothing but a slight stoning, very mild and difficult to even notice any effects. And simply putting the powder in my mouth and sucking only the juices, had NO effects, and tasted absolutely unbearable.

So on friday, heres when I actually got some results. I only had about a half a gram left, and smaller doses had left me no luck, so I decided to empty 1/2 of the remaining powder into a spoon.

T+00- I took a big jug of kool aid, and I put a gulp of it in my mouth first. Then while I still had the gulp in my mouth, I opened my mouth and dumped the 1/4 a gram of kanna that was in the spoon into my mouth and quickly swallowed. I immediately chased this with tons more kool aid, to mask the aftertaste, and it works very well. There was absolutely no foul taste at all!

Immediately following this I got this huge buzz accompanied with a mild high, kind of like a low dose of Codeine, or a dose of Vicodin. This was very pleasant and my body felt warm and content. I enjoyed walking and sitting and everything. It was much like an opiate buzz.

After listening to some music, about a half hour later, I decided to go take a walk. As soon as I stepped outside, I was greeted with a blast of sunshine and fresh air, and it felt great. It was about 90 degrees outside, but the warmth felt so good. I walked down the street and the sun was in my face. I just closed my eyes and enjoyed the walk. I felt fantastic. I also noticed that my motor skills were sort of impaired. I could walk perfectly fine, but my arms and head felt detached from my body. Not in a bad way, because I enjoyed this feeling. It makes walking, a simple process, very fun.

T+1:00: I noticed the time and headed home, the feelings were more mild now, but still pleasent. I decided to finish off the small amount of kanna that was left, so I repeated the whole process that my friends and I call 'power-hits'. I noticed my eyes were red, so I put in some eyedrops. These effects continued, and I believe that all together, it lasted around an hour and a half to two hours.

All in all, kanna is wonderful. It relaxes, and gives a nice high, if taken in the right way. The only method that worked for me was the one described above. My friend finds that snorting the powder gives him the best high. So anyway, kanna has its good aspects, and once I found a way to get past the horrible taste it was very kind to me.

Also heres a note. Even though I felt very buzzed, nobody noticed that I was on anything, in fact despite from the heightened sensations I was feeling, I could still think perfectly clearly, and exhibited absolutely no signs of being on anything. This is an ideal drug. Mild, Powerhits.</bodytext></report>
