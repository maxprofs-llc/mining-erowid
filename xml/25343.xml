First, some previous drug experience: I've drunk a lot of beers, liquors, and such, and gotten drunk several times. I've smoked marijuana, and wasn't impressed, I tried a low dose of LSD, but was drunk/drinking and don't remember anything about it (a friend told me later that I attacked her). I also smoked methamphetamine, tried morning glory seeds, and did plenty of DXM. Never have I seen any mentionable hallucinations, that may be worth noting.

Anyway, I was surfing the internet and found information on dimenhydrinate, and it's counterpart, diphenhydramine. What the hell, I was gaining a tolerance to regular doses of DXM, and needed a new experience. I had had an experience with motion sickness pills and pseudoephedrine a year ago, but didn't notice any effects, but I think I took a small amount (anywhere from five to seven), and I felt the large amounts of pseudoephedrine more. I wasn't exactly sure what the charm of this drug was from reading the reports and information, since it didn't apparently open the mind or bring euphoria, but I was all up for a night of seeing stuff that wasn't real.

So, I went to Wal-Mart and got a box of twelve (300 mg) generic motion sickness pills. Me and two friends were camping out that night, so I had decent sitters. Everything was set. That was a Sunday.

Anyway, me and my two friends were laying around talking, about an hour and a half after ingestion, and I began laughing a lot more than usual. My mood had lifted a lot. I had cottonmouth, and was drinking water. I tried to get up to pee, and realized that I was tripping hard. My body weighed a ton and it was hard to stand. I also noticed that nothing my friends were saying made sense. I recognized the words they were saying, but putting them in any logical order was almost impossible. I spent the entire night laughing and saying 'huh'. Occasionally, I would glance at something and it would look like something else, but simply fixing my gaze on it would correct it. It was kind of like a dream you're conscious of having.

Sometime over the course of the week I managed to get a huge bottle (400 pills) of generic diphenhydramine allergy medicine. I figured my system required a higher dose, and would be ready when I wanted one. The following Friday, I was to attend a carnival with some friends, and felt I would need some kind of a fix to not drown in boredom. So I took eight (200 mg) of the allergy pills. I found that about an hour later my mood had lifted, but about thirty minutes later it was near impossible to walkmy body weighed a ton and was quite fatigued. I wasn't in the dream-like state I experience with the initial experience, but things did seem a little more confusing.  I went and sat in the car, with the windows down, and it began to seem like a mosquito would bite my arms every couple of minutes. I rolled up the windows, and it subdued a little (some of these were actually mosquitos, I learned later, but some were not). Within an hour all effects subsided, I was able to rejoin my friends and carry on conversations.

This lack of any type of enjoyable effect was starting to piss me off, plus I felt urged to continue taking the pills since I had so many, or at least that was what I told myself. A friend was spending the night with me that Sunday, so I took 18 (450 mg) of the pills. I felt the effects of the body weighing a lot, had extreme cottonmouth, and felt somewhat dreamlike, but I was able to converse with my friend and watch 'Magnolia' without missing a beat.

The next night (Monday) I thought perhaps the presence of distractions might be keeping the pills from working, although something made me want to take the pills for something other than the hallucinationssomething was urging me to ingest them. I took sixteen (400 mg) of the pills at 11:00, and then at 11:30, took six (150 mg) more. I can't justify why I took those pills, I don't remember why I did. I felt euphoria and was laughing about two hours later, but soon felt like I was living in a confusing dream - my remote control became incredibly interesting, and my room seemed larger than it had before - but then I began to think I saw things out of the corner of the eye. For no reason at all (I never saw anything) I became jumpy and frightened. I felt delirious and kept asking myself why I did this to my system. I soon went to sleep, and slept deeply.

The next night I was felt compelled to take the pills again, but I can't remember how many I took (between ten and twelve (250mg &amp; 300mg)). There were no effects at all this final time, although I slept deeper than usual.

I don't understand why for a few nights I was unable to not do this drug. It seems I had an extremely short term addiction to these pills, which is really the only interesting thing about them I've found. If anyone has any comments/thoughts on this, I'd like to hear them. They produced no positive effects whatever, except about fifteen minutes of euphoria, followed by a delirious mindset that wasn't enjoyable at all. The only time the pills were even reminiscent of a fulfilling 'good time' were at our campout, but I believe it was the company I kept and not the pills I took. If you can take these and see hallucinations, good for you. These things may be more dangerous than it seems. (I also apologize if anyone thought I was making light of true addiction in this report, it was just the best term to use for an unexplainable desire to take a substance.)</bodytext></report>
