When taking Amanitas I was expecting an psylocybin experience. In those days we did not have the internet to look up new things so we trusted the experience of friends. About 4 in the afternoon a few of us split a large Amanita cap.

The experience was very dissociative. I was watching through my eyes but my reasoning was not functioning. More than once I found myself on the floor with no memory of falling. While I was concerned, I in no way felt panicked. I finally sat in a chair in a room with friends who did not know I had consumed any drugs and while I was quite quiet I did not raise suspicions unless I tried to walk.

While I have had other chances to take this mushroom I have passed. It is interesting in its historical context as a mushroom available in Europe before the new world.</bodytext></report>
