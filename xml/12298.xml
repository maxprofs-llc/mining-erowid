I purchased some extract off of a website a week ago. Much to my delight, it arrived today and I eagerly opened it. I decided to wait until the evening to smoke it with my brother and a roommate.

At 11:00pm, I grabbed an apple from the fridge adn my roommate carved it into a pipe (We didn't want to taint the MJ pipes with the nasty salvia taste). I loaded the pipe up with Salvia and settled into the couch. I knew that the setting was a little off, because the tv was on. So I decide to take it easy and go for a low dose. I loaded up a 1/10 of a gram of 6x extract into the apple and lit it. I pulled in a couple of good hits and, when I realized that it was taking effect, set the pipe aside.

The trip was a mild level 2 on the Salvia scale. I could sense a sort of confusion, my body was acting independently of my mind. If I had taken another hit it would have blasted me off (I have been very high on the scale before). I refrained from going overboard at this point and let the trip settle down. After 10 minutes, I was back to baseline.

Next up was my brother. I packed him a decent dose and let him settle back in his bean bag with the apple pipe. He had a hard time pulling smoke and set it aside after a few hits. He said he could feel something and was anxious to build a gravity bong to get more smoke.

My roommate decided to give it a shot with the apple pipe. I told him to try it in his room away from distractions. I left him in privacy. After 10 minutes, he came out pretty disoriented. Then, he just settled into the couch and grabbed a blunt.

We then settled down for awhile and watched Tv.

An hour later, my brother and I put together a gravity bong out of a 2 liter and a mop bucket. We set it up in my room and got a bowl ready. I sat on the floor and fired it up. The 2 liter was filled with smoke. I got ready, and asked my brother to turn off the lights. I inhaled about half of it and started to spit. I relaxed and held it in. Instantly, I could feel it come on. A very strange inebriation! My visual field became darker and more surreal I sucked down the last bit of smoke, and laid back down on the floor.

Except I became the floor... My vision was extremely impaired. I saw very earthy tones browns greens. I had no control over my body. I remember flailing around like a dead fish. I tried to pull back concepts of reality and managed to pull my self up and get into bed. It seemed like I was a part of everything or everything was me. I was afraid that this was permanent mindset. I thought maybe this plant triggered some psychotic element in my brain and that I would stay in this state of mind forever. My mind would try to pull out information to help me like: 'this will only last 15 minutes' 'people have never been killed by this' etc.. These little pieces of reality I kept trying to hold on to, and they helped me communicate to my brother. They also allowed me to relax a bit. After getting into my bed, I decided to let the plant take me, and meditate.

Then the being spoke to me. I saw strange green patterns and an open mouth with teeth laughing at me. It said 'So you thought this would be fun?!'. The being knew or thought that I was taking this recreationally and not treating it with respect. I starting arguing with it and said I wasn't and that I wanted to learn from it. I told it I had questions. It didn't think I was sincere, but it humored me anyway. I remember saying, 'I don't know what happens if you die, is there a hell or heaven? What is out there? Do you need to lead a good life...' I remeber it cackling back 'Is there a Hell?! Is there a Heaven?! And then it shot me back. I began grasping reality again. For the next half hour I settled back into baseline. I don't know why the plant didn't answer my question, and I don't know why it felt I was not respecting the plant. Until I answer that question, I will not try it again.

My brother tried the gravity bong after I settled down, but, strangely, did not feel anything. Salvia is a strange plant indeed!</bodytext></report>
