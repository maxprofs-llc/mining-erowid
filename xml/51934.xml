Alright, well I'll start by saying that I am 16 and am a somewhat healthy person. I am a very frequent marijuana user, about 1-3 times a day. I take no medication, and have tried DXM a few times, shrooms once, alcohol, and pot. I go to therapy because I am facing a few relationship troubles in my life along with school and the law. I am basically a reasonable person and am mostly level headed. On this particular day, I hadn't planned on doing the seeds that night, but I was in a good mood all day.

Preparation:
/n
About a month prior, I picked up 5 packets of Burpee Heavenly Blue Morning Glory Seeds at $1.79 a pack weighing apx. 1.5 g each. Total, there were 272 seeds exactly. I was unaware if the seeds were coated with pesticides, etc., so I put them in a tuperware dish with a little bit of washing detergent and water. I shook them for about a minute, washed them, and repeated. I let them sit overnight on a paper towel to dry. The next day, I dumped the seeds into our Mr. Coffee coffee grinder. I ground the seeds almost to powder. They were milky yellow looking and smelled a little like nuts, but very unique. I dumped them all onto a plate and seperated the chunkier parts from the powder because I planned on grinding up the chunks more, but I didn't bother.

Setting:
/n
My room in late March in the Chicago suburbs after my mom fell asleep. I stayed in my room the almost the entire time until I fell asleep.

The time was about 10:15 when I poured the powdered seeds into a cup of bottled water. I decided to try and avoid tap water because of the extra ions and chemicals found in it that I heard could break down the LSA. I didn't put the chunky seeds in simply because I didn't know how strong the effects were. I regret that. The water looked kinda gross, but I downed it. It didn't taste bad at all and went down pretty easily. I went downstairs to drink a few glasses of orange juice; I heard that vitamin C can aid in psychedelic experiences.

I went outside to have a cigarette behind my garage and noticed that there was a kind of light distortion in my peripheral vision. The ground seemed to be somewhat glowing. Very subtle, but I got excited. I went back inside to my room and put on a skateboarding video to waste a little time.

T-1:00 hrs:
/n
After about half the video is done, I didn't really feel any effects. My pupils were pretty dialated and my eyes were somewhat bloodshot. My eyes get shot really easily. I became a little disappointed because I thought onset was supposed to arrive at about 1 hour.

T-1:20 hrs:

Believing that I had made a dud mixture, I decided to take out my bowl. I didn't have any weed, so I scraped the sides of my piece and got about 7 nice resin hits off of it.

T-1:30 hrs:
/n
I felt a nice high from smoking, and got excited again. I looked at my eyes and they were almost fully dialated. I started laughing at the insane look on my face. I laid back down and closed my eyes to see some cool visuals.

T-1:45 hrs:
/n
I saw that it is almost a half hour since I smoked and I still felt pretty blitzed. Usually after only a few hits I am coming down after about 15-20 min. Things started to have a sort of psychedelic feel to them. My sense of touch was intensified because I remember sliding my hands across my bed and feeling really good.

The effects were definitely set in by this point. Smoking was the perfect entrance into the trip, though I'd really classify this more as a high than a trip. I put on some Electric Light Orchestra and Pink Floyd and laid back down in my bed. The music was very visual behind my eyes. I was able to 'see' the guitar's notes in Shine On You Crazy Diamond. Everything seemed so wonderful. I had a permanent smile on my face for about the entire time. In the dark my walls seemed to have a colored dotting effect and were quite translucent. I thought about a lot of issues in my life and didn't exactly resolve any of them, but I felt good about where I stood on many of them. It seemed like it was impossible for the trip to turn bad. With shrooms, I had a terrible trip (I thought that my friends were my hallucinations and were actually police). Overall I felt great

T-3:00-5:00 hrs:
/n
During this time I was grooving pretty good to the music I was listening to: ELO, Pink Floyd, Polyphonic Spree (very psychedelic, especially 'Soldier Girl'), Led Zeppelin, and The Beattles. I put my CD (about 1 hr. long) on repeat. Every time I heard a song it felt like the first time I had ever heard it and I was transfixed on the glowing rhythms of it all. I laughed at myself because I knew that it was just silly, but that thought just made everything hilarious. My visuals were a little blurred, but everything was very colorful. My sense of touch was very intense and I tried to touch just about every texture I could find.

/n
T-6:00 hrs:
/n
I got a little tired of my music and decided that I should probably go to sleep (about 4:30 am). Everything still had a psychedelic afterglow and my eyes were still a little dialated, but not fully anymore. I closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep, but found it more difficult than I had imagined. It probably took me about 45 min. to eventually fall into a deep sleep.

Next day:
/n
My eyes look a little tired, but nothing out of the ordinary. I felt no hangover effects at all. I felt groggy due to the fact that I only got 5 hrs. of good sleep, but again, nothing out of the ordinary.

In the future I plan on taking about 350 ground seeds using the same preparation method that I used before. On another note, I felt minimal to no nausea. I think the only nausea I felt was because I was aware that MG could cause nausea. I think that if I hadn't known that, it would have been completely fine. I compare this to a light shroom trip, but I think it would have been better if I had taken all of my seeds and if I had been in a more stimulating environment than my bedroom.</bodytext></report>
