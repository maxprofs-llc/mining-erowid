I recently ordered some Lagochilus inebrians (intoxicating mint) and decided to try it out. I decided to make a tea of it. (Used the same amount of mint as I would use of green tea) I drank two infusions with a little lemon and honey, did not taste great but not horrible.

After about 45 minutes I felt a mild relaxation and intoxication. It was not much. Sort of like having 3 beers but things appeared clearer. And it was more sedating and less cloudy then I find beer. The effects last for about 2-3 hours.

It was nothing special but not placebo. I plan to try it at a higher dose and maybe with Kratom.</bodytext></report>
