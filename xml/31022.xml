So this last weekend I had the house to myself and I decided to have some friends over for the weekend. My parents were paying me to watch over my dog while they were out of town, so I figured hey why not have a little fun. At school the previous week I had purchased two hits of some so-so blotter called dragons, although I never saw any sort of dragon on the paper so I'm sort of just thinking they made up the name. I had had an experience with one hit of this stuff prior and had a very mild not so mind blowing trip. I figured two hits would give me a better time. I popped the hits at around six while sitting with my friend Gregg. Whenever I dose I always have doubts about the acids potency or even overall actuality of it being real. But I try to let these thoughts go as not to somehow diminish my trip. After about a half hour I decided to eat five Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. I was curious as to how the ergot compounds played off each other. I sat back and let the drugs take hold.

At about an hour I was noticing the acid a little, it was a very slow come on and by this time I was starting to feel some nausea from the seeds. My friend Jason called around this time and told me he was coming over to buy some adderall. I told him just head over anytime. While waiting for him I started to get very energized and nervous. I just wanted to get the deal over so I could enjoy my trip. I started pacing around my house. Running into everything feeling somewhat intoxicated. My friend Gregg was just sitting there and we were trying to discuss things but my mind was drifting and I knew I wouldnt be able to make any sense. I sat down on the floor and my dog came over and I looked in her eyes and I swear to god I could communicate with her. I felt she knew something was different about me and she obeyed my commands in an uncanny fashion.

After that Jason came over, he wanted twenty addies. I had the hardest time counting them out and had to let Gregg do it for me. After all was figured out I got really ancy because I didnt know what to do with myself and the hallucinogens were really starting to effect my perception. There were faces bubbled outward and morphed I could see fractally patterns seeming to tie their faces together. I started pacing frantically. I couldnt make eye contact with either of them and I just started babbling about everything that was on my mind. I couldnt stop moving. My friend Gregg urged me to just sit down but I couldnt. My friend Jason said he had some downers if I wanted any, but I had never heard of them. He called them neurontins and said hey had done some research on them and that they were legit. Trusting him I took two 300mg caps and just waited.

I felt a little calmer and I decided I wanted to smoke a bowl. We all went out on my porch it was really cold out and I was shivering. I took several hits holding them in for a very long time it seemed, and when I exhaled I felt like my lungs were collapsing. The snow and the shadows of the night were warping and dancing. I felt really alone. That no one knew what I was seeing and thinking. We finished it and Jason took off. I kept thinking I freaked the shit out of him. At this time I had chilled out enough to watch a movie. Or at least try. Bad idea. We started watching Half Baked, but I couldnt follow it. I felt like I couldnt even look directly at the screen because it was too bright and the screen was bulging out and swirling.

I looked away, constantly staring at the ceiling and the walls. They were breathing heavily. My field of vision started to tunnel and my peripheral vision started patterning but if I tried to look at it would disappear. Then things started to get really strange. this sounds totally bizarre and I still cant fully explain it. From the fractally patterns which resembled groups of linking numbers started 'reaching' into my mind. Vivid pictures started to penetrate my third eye. I started seeing images of middle aged women, very average looking, overweight in some cases. They were moving but standing in front of some kind of white wall. It looked as if they were being videotaped or photographed by someone who I couldnt see. I couldnt figure out what they were doing there.

I started to think they were actually in my house. The images were not scary but the breach from reality and the emergence of the unconcious psyche startled me, where did these people come from? Why was I seeing them? The faces were not familiar at all and it started freaking me out. No one knew what I was seeing and I couldnt describe it accurately. My friend Dan came over and I tried to tell him what was happening but he seemed not to know what to do. I felt completely psychotic. I couldnt erase or evade the images. They were permeating every corner of my conciousness. I started to become terrified. I curled up into a ball on the couch and just tried to relax. They still remained in my mind and I felt like I was floating. Then I felt like I weighed a ton and my head felt extremely heavy. I just wanted to go to sleep.

Later on my friend Sean came and pretty much as soon as he walked in I was fine. I was still seeing visuals but the 'lysergic ladies' were starting to fade from my visual/mental field. I started babbling to him on and on about what happened. he seemed genuinely interested where as the others did not. we went in my hot tub and I mellowed out and drank some beers. the surface of the bubbling water was extremely psychadelic. We talked and smoked a few bowls of some really good organic pot and I felt so relaxed and open. I felt as if I had penetrated something and then came back to a reasonable level. Its just odd that when he got there I felt so much better.

The rest of the night was awesome. It was mostly a body trip but I was seeing some visuals at times. I've squeeged my self for a while and I dont think Ill be taking seeds for quite some time. Also after researching gabapentin which is what neurontin is I dont know if I really want to take anti seizure meds. I dont have seizures. Ill do acid again. I mean I've done it alot and I love it, but the seeds can turn on you I think. That and they make me nauseaus.</bodytext></report>
