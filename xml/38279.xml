Background:
/n
I have had a somewhat limited exposure to psychedelics.  My experiences include a half dozen experiences with psilocybin mushrooms, as many with salvia d., and an irresponsibly large number of dxm trips.  I received an amount of 5-meo-dipt in the mail about a month previous.  I began researching dosages, and how to properly weigh doses, and came to the conclusion that a very accurate scale was neccesary for me to feel comfortable.  I acquired an electric scale about two weeks ago, and contacted my friend N, who is my preferred trip partner.  We compared schedules, and found an evening when we were both free of obligations, and had none the next day either.

Beforehand:
/n
Having read that this substance can cause stomach issues, N and I decided to fast the day of.  During the course of the day, I consumed about 3 gallons of fruit juice, trying to prevent fatigue.  In the afternoon, I measured out two portions of chemical, each weighing approximately 9mg.  The scale that I used was accurate to 1mg, but was not a very expensive scale.  Each portion, I weighed repeatedly, and the mean of the weights was 9mg.  Neither of us have a good home to partake of strong chemicals in, so we rented an inexpensive hotel room near the community college to reside in for the evening.  At 5:15pm, we checked into the hotel room, and I left N there.  I went to my evening college class, which was quite short, promising N I would be back as soon as I could.

6:45pm (0:00)
/n
I arrive back at the room, set my stuff down, and pull out the two capsule; N and I each down one.  Easy enough.  
/n
/n
I am in a very good mood this evening.  It has been more than a month since the last time I used any intoxicant, class is going well, my job is going well, my fiancee has no complaints about my activities for the night, and I've got my tripping buddy with me. N, on the other hand, is not in as good of a mind set as I am.  He is quite pleased with the prospects of the evening, but his life isn't as tranquil as mine is.

/n
7:00pm (T+0:15)
/n
I can't report any alert yet, but I am feeling different.  I can't point at any effects that I am noticing, only an awareness that I've consumed a drug.  We roll up two very small joints for later, and talk about a college basketball game that is on TV.  After the joints are rolled, we decide to go for a stroll a few blocks down the road to  aquire food for later.  Before leaving, I make mention that I'm feeling 'something'.  
/n
/n
7:15pm (T+0:30)
/n
We arrive at the party store, with a subway attached to the side of it.  I go into the party store to use the ATM, and N decides to smoke a cigarette and wait outside.  Generally I try to talk to the clerks in party stores and other places, knowing how boring of a job it can be.  This time though, I feel the urge to avoid conversation, because I have nothing to say.  Also, while I had no problems operating the ATM, I realize that I had no real understanding of what I was doing either.  Just muscle memory (of sorts) guiding me through the operation.  As I left the store, I realized this fact, and counted it as my first alert.  Approaching N, he comments that he's beginning to feel the effects as well.  He's had his first alert.  
/n
/n
7:25pm (T+0:40)
/n
In subway, we find one guy making food, with no one else in the store (other than the 6 customers waiting in line).  When our turn comes, we talk to him, and find out he got called in on his day off, and got screwed, being the only employee there.  Conversation with him was suprisingly easy, though if he asked a question that I did not have an answer prepared for, it would take me some time to find the right answer.  Effects are comming on stronger at this point.  Brightening of lights, sounds are dulling, something akin to dizziness is filling my body, though it is enjoyable.  Nausea also begins to set in as well.  Luckily, we quickly conclude our business at subway, and begin walking.
/n
/n
7:35pm (T+0:50)
/n
Walking back, the nausea completely disappears.  The sun is completely down, and the air is filled with a drizzle that's closer to fog it's so light.  I feel energetic, and at peace.  My body feels good, and the chill in the air makes it feel even better.  We take note that the street lights had halos (because of the fog) around them when we first set off to subway.  On the way back these same street lights now have starburst patterns to them.  Crossing the street behind a car stopped at a traffic light, we realize that the car is a cop, and we're jaywalking.  No paranoia or fear is caused by this (nor did we get in trouble).
/n
/n
7:45pm (T+1:00)
/n
I would say the ascent of the trip is in full swing now.  We've arrived back at the hotel.  Sitting in the warmth, my nausea comes back to me.  N reports no problems.  I lay down, and feel immediately better.  I call my fiancee, having told her that I would this evening, and deciding it was either now, or never.  We talked briefly, and she was definitely aware of a dullness to my conversation (she was also aware of the cause).  N and I talk about random things.  The conversation was intellectual, as it usually is with us, but we were both feeling clownish, and our arguments would often get ridiculous (with both of us grinning).
/n
/n
8:15pm (T+1:30)
/n
Nausea has pretty much abated.  I sit up, and notice that most of my buzz is gone.  I am definately inebriated from the substance, but the substance does not feel like it's going any farther; this would be the peak.  N and I are both very suprised that it is only 8:15pm, as it seems like it feels like it should be an hour or two later.  Definite time dilation.  We talk for a bit longer, at this point the conversation is a bit more subdued, but also deeper.
/n
/n
8:45pm (T+2:00)
/n
We've given up hope that the substance has more to offer us this evening.  We're still experiencing what we were half an hour ago, and suspect the effects won't diminish for a while yet.  Neither of us is disappointed by the effects, but we were both looking for more this evening.  So, we light up a joint.  I feel the effects of this quicker than I would have expected to.  The effects aren't as much as I would have expected them to be; my mind remains pretty clear.  I get a very good body high though, made even better by the 5meo-dipt (which so far seems to be pretty much a physical buzz).
/n
/n
9:00pm (T+2:15)
/n
We decide to go for a walk, hoping the strange atmosphere outside with be a catalyst for better effects from the 5meo-dipt.  It turns out not to be really.  After 10 minutes, we decide to try a booster dose, and head back to the hotel.  
/n
/n
We weigh out 4mg each, and decide to experiment with different routes of ingestion.  I pour the powder under my tongue, and wait for it to absorb.  This turns out to be a bad idea.  The powder tingles slightly, which is OK, but also stimulates large amounts of saliva production.  In turn, my mouth quickly fills with chemically saturated saliva, which over runs my taste buds.  It eventually pillages the back of my tongue (which seems to be the most sensitive to these chemically tastes).  I wave the white flag, and swallow the whole mess.  The taste is horrible, and I am unable to get it outta my mouth.
/n
/n
Watching my torment, N puts the substance on a piece of paper, holds it upto his nostril, and inhales it.  He reports no ill effects, other than a rather unpleasant post-nasal drip.
/n
/n
/n
10:00pm (T+3:15)
/n
N and I are entirely come down from both the pot, and the 5meo-dipt.  We decide to go back down to the party store, and get some beer.  We buy a forty each.  We finish the night off drinking, smoking an additional joint, and talking.
/n
/n
1:15am (T+6:15)
/n
N goes to sleep at this point, and the next morning reports having had no problems falling asleep.  Him and I both feel we would have been able to sleep much earlier (11ish) if we hadn't taken the booster dose.  I, though, am not ready for bed.  Chemical states are something I rarely get to enjoy, and I decide to snort a bit more 5meo-dipt, and watch tv for a while.  I take another 2mg, and settle down to watch The X-Files for the next 3 hours.  This last dose gave me no real effects, other than just enough mental agitation to keep me awake.  It also increased my fatigue noticeable.  Definitely not constructive, but then, I hadn't intended to be constructive either.  At 4:30am, I fall asleep.
/n
/n
Aftermath:
/n
At 8am, the alarm goes off, and I get back up.  N wished to be home early this morning, so I decided to get up even earlier, to give myself time to wake up before I had to drive him home.  I am incrediably dehydrated.  I make the comment that I feel like a dry twig.  Other than that, I feel pretty darn good.  Actually, for having drank, smoked pot, taken a strange chemical (three times), and only slept 3.5 hrs, it's a miracle how good I feel.  I am definitely slow in my thoughts, and I have a headache from the dehydration, but all things considered, it could be a whole hell of alot worse.  After a shower, and making a pig of myself at the continental breakfast the hotel offered, I feel better.
/n

Conclusion:
/n
5meo-dipt wasn't everything I had hoped it would be, so far.  I've only done a low dose (intentionally), and I may find there to be more to it at higher doses.  I'm not disappointed with it, but it seems mild.  Time dilation was probably the strongest effect that I noticed.  I was suprised at how short lived it was.  If no new effects manifest at higher doses, I would consider the effects of this to be akin to snorting pain killers.  Not psychedelic in any manner.  On the other hand, it was very enjoyable, and N and I plan on trying 13mg next time.</bodytext></report>
