feeling the onset now. I was clear-headed, energetic, and a lot more focused than I usually was. I decided to take this opportunity to do my English homework, to my amazement I was actually enjoying doing it whereas usually I find myself making every little excuse to get out of it but in contrast I was actually putting off other things for my English.

The first hour flew by as I was doing my homework, at around the T +1hr mark I felt to feel a bit depressed because I wasn't able to do two things at once, I basically felt like I was underachieving for some odd-reason,or like I was coming-down.

I started to notice some euphoria which could be best compared to a cocaine buzz. I found myself taking those deep, pleasurable breaths and often lying back on my bed and just enjoying the fluttering in my chest.

The cocaine feeling has started to subside and continuously sucking the roof of my mouth is starting to annoy me.

The peak is basically over. I am slowly losing the desire again to do any school work but start on my Computing Homework to make the most of what's left.
