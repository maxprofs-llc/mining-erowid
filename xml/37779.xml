The other night two friends and I conducted an experiment. The original idea was that if we ingested a normal amount of IAP, and after that tapered off a rather small dose of 2cI, we would probably get the mdma effect and have a stronger 2cI experience. That way we can keep our doses small, and they will still be plenty active.

It was about 8:30 p.m. when we took the IAP. My capsule was torn and ravaged. I began to feel it rather soon considering Iap is very slow. The first few hours were strong. My pupils were wide, my muscles were twitching, but around 11:30 p.m. the IAP started to slow down on us. So now the 2CI was needed. Around midnight we swallowed the 2CI. I had no end at all on my capsule. Because of the IAP psychedelic visuals were no more than twenty minutes after ingestion. The rest of the night was exactly what we were trying to achieve. A nice clear trip with lots of insight. We came to alot of good assumptions. Sometimes I'd float away in the visuals, and sometimes I'd float away in the insight. There was alot of laughs and a few scares like when I ran into a spider web (a big one). We ended the night with a swim, not long though because it was pretty chilly.

I recommend this experience, but keep your IAP dosage low, as you only need about 1 dose, plus too much may distract the 2cI. I'd say keep your 2CI dose pretty low to moderate as well, its kinda the point.</bodytext></report>
