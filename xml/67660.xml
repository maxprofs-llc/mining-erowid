I was tooling around on the web one day trying to find out what pill I just found in the parking lot. It turned out to be Tramadol. As I researched it I found that it was easy to get over the internet. I was a pot smoker for years  and had quite some years ago. I also took Percs and Vics for fun when I could get them. It turns out that Tramadol was not a controlled substance and appeared to be fairly harmless. I purchased 108 50mg tabs for fairly cheap. I took 2 when they arrived and felt nothing. Then I topped them off with two more. About three hours later I felt very good and was alert, comfortable and very pleasant to be around.

I used them every couple of days and had no problem stopping for a week. I soon ran out and did not buy any for a couple of weeks. Then I got the urge to feel the buzz and bought another 180 50mg tabs. I took 5 right off the bat and stayed high until they were gone. I was taking 30 a day and I am glad I ran out. That was yesterday. I now am having very bad withdrawal symptoms and was tempted to by some more.  I soon realized that this stuff is real bad. I am done.</bodytext></report>
