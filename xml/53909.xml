I have been using analgesics for over a year now and have mainly used Oxycodone/Hydrocodone for euphoric purposes (7.5 to 10 mgs 3x a day). I do not have any real pains except those that come with the stress of life.  I am a firm believer that anything that causes positive change in one's life is an 'anti-depressant' and these drugs do exactly that for me.

I have seen many people compare Hydrocodone to Tramadol but I have found that Tramadol is more similiar to Oxycodone.  I would compare 100mgs of Tramadol to about 5-6mgs of Oxycodone, with the euphoric, well-being feelings not as intense (This doesn't mean 200mgs of tramadol would equal 10mgs of Oxycodone...the drug doesnt work like that).

Tramadol takes much longer to kick in (up to 3 hours for first time users) but lasts much longer than my average pain killer (I have felt the effects up to 18 hours later).  I have found that taking 50mgs every 4 hours will keep me feeling great at all times.</bodytext></report>
