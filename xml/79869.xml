I found some old cough and sinus pills lying around and decided to try them out. The only main ingredients were acetaminophen and pseudoephredine. The dose per pill was 500mg/60mg respectively. I have read about people experiencing intense euphoria from pseudoe, and also others have reported that nothing happened at all.

I took 4 pills. I did not experience anything other then a little bit of jitteryness (is that even a word?)
