My Dr wouldn't give me a sedative &amp; I decided to try Aromatherapy &amp; medicinal herbs. I got this lettuce, a herbal sedative, from Culpeppers in England.

I brewed 1.5g in a cup for 15min &amp; then drank. I'd read a herbalist book saying overdose causes stupor, depressed respiration, coma &amp; death....so when I felt zonked so quickly &amp; strongly I assumed the worst, and spent the next hour staving off a huge panic attack by watching WWF wrestling (relaxing TV??!!). I'm still alive but next time, if there is one, I'll take a teaspoon of tea instead of a cup as my dosage level!!</bodytext></report>
