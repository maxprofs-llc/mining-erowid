Well after reading reports on Brugmansia/Datura and how easily it was to not only obtain but have weird hallucinations I decided to try it. I went out to buy a tree at the local garden shop. Well they had a few. I chose the one that hadnt bloomed yet but was about to so I could try the flowers at a later date. I believe the type to be B. Versicolor (Ecuador Pink) as that is what the other flowers looked like around it. Anyways later that night I thought I would have a go at trying it. I boiled 2 large 8' leaves in about .5 litres of water. This sat for a good 10-15 minutes. I was unsure of the boiling time.

Well I took the tea I had just made upstairs and drank it in under 5 minutes (the boiling leaves smelt like spinach to me. It took me a while to figure that one out). While I got the feeling of intoxication slightly nothing much happened. So I decided to chow down on some of the smaller leaves. By that time I had drank about 2 big ones (tea) and at the end of the night 2 more big leaves (raw) and about 12 small (raw) ones about 2-3' long. Extremely disapointed that NOTHING was happening except for a slight drunkenness, dilated pupils and my mouth was quite dry (hence why I kept taking more, I know that this is where a lot of people get frustated and take more and have a fucked up trip but I was willing to risk it) okay ONE more tea. I threw about 5 leaves in the mix I think 2 big and 3 small. Again I drank this down and NOTHING.

I went to lay down hoping SOMETHING would happen but I just felt nauseated, which Ive read is a sign that I'd taken too much, well I was joyed that if I took more than most people maybe Ill get more results. By this time my dry mouth had gone and hadnt returned. I decide to take a nap as I read that once I'd fallen asleep and woken up the effects would really start to hit me. Well I fell asleep and woke up 2 hours later, NOTHING had happened (I was really hoping for hallucinations of elves or something weird as Ive never gotten that from a 'natural' drug before). I was so frustrated with the damn plant. Especially after reading that some people need just 1-2 leaves and black out from it or have really strong trips. I just said fuck it and went to bed.

The next day I woke up, nothing was strange or really different so I decided I should take some more (I know it's possible to not realize its strange at the time that one is high but my sitter didnt notice anything wrong with the way I talked and I never mentioned anything about talking to people or having people walk into the room). Throughout the day I plucked off small-medium sized leaves and ate them, not a very pleasant taste, I enjoyed the tea much more as they were quite bitter (and I like my tea without milk or sugar so the bitterness in the tea form didnt bother me). So I tried different methods of getting the plant inside me. I used the old Aztec method of intoxication. I rolled up about 5 small leaves each 'package' and used one in the morning and another one later. While I felt slightly intoxicated again and I couldnt see anything that close to my face and about 8' away which made it extremely difficult to eat as I couldnt see the food.

Again, I waited and waited and waited, nothing happened. I read a report saying to mix it with water and just let it steep for a few hours-overnight, well I did that, nothing happened after 20 minutes of drinking it. I used about 5 small leaves in that mix as well (I went to a forest setting to see if anything would happen there while I was drinking it, and nothing really strange). Finally the only method I could think of would be smoking it. So I made a makeshift pipe (as I'm not a huge smoke loving person) dried part of a branch that broke off the top (enough to fill my pipe thats diameter is .5' and length 2') and attempted to smoke it. The taste wasnt bad and it gave the smell of MJ for some reason. While I felt gitty and stared at things for a while, no hallucinations, audio or visual happened in any form. So I just went to bed.

This all took place over the past 2 days. Its the 3rd day now and I have gotten no great results even though I must have ate 30 or so leaves trying to get to that state and Ive decided to stop taking it until the tree blooms so hopefully something may manifest, although I doubt it if it hasnt happened now it probably never will. All of this has lead me to the following conclusions:
/n

A) In most of the Brugmansia reports I see they always report either using or seeing flowers, this is what I think people use as identification. Maybe when the plant flowers it gives off a stronger chemicals (as I believe many plants do) and focus all of its energy and chemcials into the flowers and later the seeds. This could possibly be the reason why its not very strong for me?
/n

B)It is still in its original planter container and inside the house in my room by the window (for convience purposes, I think itll go outside after I finish writing this). There is also a light on it to make sure it gets enough sunlight. Maybe just because its a sapling its not as powerful as Brugmansia which have been growing for years. Therefore it has less chemicals inside of it which only lead to elementary symptoms. Although after 30-40 leaves I'd think something would happen.

All in all this experience was and is quite disapointing. After a while my focus came back, even though I was still eating the leaves at the time. I havent eaten anything and it seems like my pupils are going back to normal. I will have to try the Brugmansia again after it flowers and try 1 or 2 flowers to see if I get any stronger results.

There is one good thing about my experience and it was a humbling feeling. My mind goes into a nice blank state and its very easy to contemplate things. I should also mention I got the same result from eating the plant material of Morning Glory vines (I was too impatient to wait for seeds and I'm still having a problem finding the seeds after the flower has died).</bodytext></report>
