[Erowid Note: According to an article in the Feb 18, 2008 Army Times, the U.S. has stopped LSD testing military wide due to the low number of positive results detected in the past three years.]

I was reading on your site that you did not know if LSD was tested for in the military.

The U. S. Air Force definitely tests for LSD.  I know this because I was kicked out on a dirty test.  They use the GC/MS test and their cut off level is 200pg/ml. The Air Force can and will court-martial an airmen for just coming up positive, they feel the test is all the evidence they need.

I do know the Army and Navy use the same test as the Air force and all three use Brooks Lab. When any test regardless of the drug comes up positive the lab re-runs the test if the test comes under fire by the soldier the lab will run the test again at the same lab instead of another lab. (Jacked up I think) Wrongful use of LSD in the military can get you 5yr's in jail. The thing to remember is LSD has four components, You have ISO LSD and LSD which breakdown into four parts or isomers, and L and D on each. We know that the only active component of LSD under which it is reasonably likely that a person would feel the effects is the D isomer of the LSD so we would ignore the L isomer of LSD, the D isomer of ISO LSD and the L isomer of ISO LSD. So it is possible to come in contact with LSD and feel NO effect. I hope this will help someone.</bodytext></report>
