I'm writing this one mainly as a warning because I see a lot of bad potential, especially since it has a similar name to methylone which is now banned in the US and some are looking for replacements.  I can promise you this is nothing at all like methylone (M1).

I received this from a reputable lab which I get my synths done quite often and am positive of its high purity.  An associate also obtained a small test amount.

Vaping - Don't even try it.  My associate who prefers this method with his normal stimulants from 10mg complained of high anxiety, overwhelming stimulation that led to discomfort, and a feeling that he might have a heart attack.

Nasally - I've been testing this way.  After allergy tests I worked up to 20mg giving at least 3-4 hours in between each test (1mg, 3mg, 5mg, 8mg, 10mg, 15mg, and 20mg).  This led to the same symptoms my associate had.  There were also body tremors at this level.  The heart feels like there are irregular beats and I can feel it like it wants to pop out my chest.  10 years of researching and this is the first time fear set in that I might be having a heart attack.  An earlier test of 10mg had close to those same symptoms, but I wasn't in any fear.  But that is worrisome when the 10mg jump has that drastic on a negative effect.

Positive effects - Strong stimulation (if you enjoy that, some don't).  Very mild euphoria if the dose stays low enough (5-15mg nasally for me and not possible with vaping that I can see).  Mild mood lift with low dose.
/n
/n
Neutral effects - talkative, pacing, racing thoughts, and restlessness. (possible higher body temperature change and definite increase in heart rate even in small amounts)
/n
/n
Negative effects - fear of heart attack (and the possibility of one), irregular and fast heart beat (palpitations), sweating (especially sweaty palms), shaking, cravings for more, panic, some aching in the shoulders for me, paranoia, and possible death with high single dose or multiple doses within a few hours.

Warning - Please after your allergy test start with only a few mg's if you choose to test this chemical, it is very potent and risky without the euphoria most are looking for.  I would recommend nasally to never go beyond 15-20mg or your life could be in danger if what you have is pure.  Even after a small amount of tolerance builds I still have backed off to 10-15mg at the most.  I hope this message get's out because people are getting their hands on this stuff from irresponsible people who are selling it to people that aren't responsible themselves and have the pride to think nothing can hurt them.  I assure you this one can.  With experience with meth and cocaine (also crack) this was more scary than the worst times with those, or at least right up there with them. For me, the risk is not worth the lack of euphoria on this one.  It appears to be far too stimulating even in small doses and too rough on the heart.

This is a dangerous research chemical that should only be possessed by experts who take extreme precautions. NEVER attempt any dose of this or any chemical active at low mg ranges without a quality .001 mg scale.</bodytext></report>
