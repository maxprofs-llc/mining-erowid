I started taking 2 tablets (300mg. each) of Olmifon (adrafinil) each morning.  I did this for 7 days or so before I noticed any effect whatsoever.

The effect, at first, was merely a strange alteration in the overall energy levels in my body.  I no longer became exhausted and sleepy in the afternoon or early evening.  But, I could also go to sleep easier than usual!

That fugue many people (not only college students) get, the brain just falls into an empty loop -- a brain fart -- is rarely present now.  Whether or not I'm paying attention, I am always thinking, but it isn't any sort of manic of compulsive thought drive.

I have only been taking Olmifon for 2-3 weeks, so I cannot comment on any effects past this time, but I have not noticed any side-effects.  [Early worries of the 'inner tension' listed as a possible side-effect have been removed as the pain I felt initially was due, it now seems, to taking 10mg. of Deprenyl in one day, along with 600mg. of Olmifon.]

It does not resemble amphetamines in any way at all, which I've found odd since it does awaken the mind so. OTHER:

A potent oral opium extract at night had a sedating effect that lasted through to the morning and seemed to conquer any cognitive enhancement of Olmifon.  This day my brain was able to slip into the fugue mentioned above.

However, alcohol (only tested with beer) at night does not seem to weaken Olmifon for the following day, like the oral opium did.

Do not know if Cannabis knocks down Olmifon, I would image so.

It seems that Olmifon is a mild attention-cognition tweaker that can easily be crushed with the typical assortment of stupifying drugs. [Syntopressin does bring back cognitive awareness in the midst of intense Cannabis intoxication.  Sadly, Sandoz has stopped production and the few remaining Syntopressin manufacturers have created a monopoly costly for the smart drug enthusiast.]

Other than not being able to push past opiate intoxication, Olmifon seems to be a perfect addition to the medicine cabinet of college students and those needing a brain to function constantly throughout the day.

Cost varies; Europeans should expect to pay less than 10 Euros for a box of 40 tablets, while Americans end up spending $20-$40 for the same box. Taking 2 tablets per day at this cost could get very expensive.  Besides, the literature warns against taking Olmifon for more than 5 months solid, without having liver enzymes checked.</bodytext></report>
