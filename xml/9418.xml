My first experiences with GHB were not so pleasant.  I either didn't take enough or I took too much.  I found when the optimal dose is administered, the effects are enlightening.  I dont know how many mg. of GHB I take, but My source dilutes the GHB in water to an extent that 2 oz. capful is optimal.  Too much and I get cross eyed and sick.  Too little and I don't notice it.  The difference between too much and too little can be as small as 1/4 oz of diluted GHB!  The moral of the story is to know your tolerance and limits.  Start off with a small amount and gradually increase dosage until you reach the desired effect.  I have seen friends take too much and piss their pants.  I usually just fall into an unarousable sleep for a couple hours if I take too much.  I also get the shakes when I take a good dose.  What causes this??? Weird effect on nervous system.  When I take the right amount I feel like a very clean drunken feeling.</bodytext></report>
