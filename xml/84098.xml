I have tried codeine as a recreational drug several times in the past at quite high doses. I like the warm, peaceful feeling which I reserve for an occasional 'treat'.  However, I don't like the caffeine buzz from large quantities of AC&amp;C or similar compounds, using the usual cold-water extraction (see Codeine FAQ). And I'm somewhat concerned about getting an accidental ASA or acetaminophen OD if the extraction is less than ideal. Here's how I got around both problems.

Rationale: Codeine phosphate is rapidly and efficiently absorbed rectally. ASA &amp; acetaminophen are not very well absorbed by this route. Reports vary wildly on absorption of caffeine from rectal or enema administration, from 'none' to 'major buzz'; possibly it is absorbed high in the colon but not lower down.

Preparation &amp; equipment: See the FAQ &amp; other recipe/experiences for the basic extraction method.  I find it handy to keep a spray-bottle of water in the fridge for rinsing down the original container &amp; filter. Additional equipment: a drugstore rectal syringe (bulb type), 2 oz. size is usually enough, or, better, a plunger syringe of 50-100 ml. capacity (no needle required!). An excellent &amp; cheap substitute is sold in automotive &amp; marine supply stores for priming 2-stroke motors. About 8' of 1/4 in. tubing may be handy, as you will want to keep the syringe vertical to maximize the amount of liquid and minimize the amount of air injected - air can cause discomfort and 'accidents'. In any case, a folded towel under the rump is a good precaution while enjoying the experience.

Dose: approx. 180 mg. codeine phosphate extracted from 24 AC&amp;C tabs (ASA, caffeine &amp; codeine) with 8 mg codeine/tab - the standard OTC formula. Dose estimated as 180 mg. rather than 24x8=192 to allow for some loss in the extraction. Note: be sure to get the tabs with ASA (Aspirin), not T1's or the generic equivalent as acetaminophen is much slower to filter &amp; is potentially more subtly toxic.

Set: It's Saturday, I woke up early, and, hey, it's the weekend, so I want to relax &amp; feel good, maybe ultimately catch up on my Zzz's. So, feeling good, a little excited or nervous at trying something I haven't done for a long while. At home by myself, in bed with a good book.

Experience:
/n
/n
t+0:00  Injected the clear extract rectally, about 60 ml. No discomfort. I lie down in bed (best position to minimize nausea, besides being relaxing).
/n
t+0:05  Already I can detect a slight stone, I think.
/n
t+0:10  Definitely a mild stone. 
/n
t+0:20  Now I'm starting to feel a strong stone: the warm-all-over, peaceful feeling.  Great!
/n
t+0:30  Eyelids feel (&amp; look heavy).  The relaxation is still increasing. No nausea; no caffeine buzz; just a lovely warm &amp; cozy feeling.
/n
t+1:00  Seems to be about the peak, but not decreasing much yet.
/n
t+1:30  Ugh! very acid belch!  How did that get all the way up there???  Nothing a little antacid won't cope with, though. 
/n
t+2:00  Still very mellow, the buzz is fading, but quite slowly.  If that belch was the worst side-effect, this is working great. 
/n
t+2:10  Bran muffin for breakfast - should help with the inevitable constipation!
/n
t+2:30  Still riding the buzz, hardly any decrease. Feeling a bit sleepy; maybe time for a Saturday morning nap. 'Honey, disconnect the phone'. 
/n

/n
t+3:30  No CEV's, no pipe dreams, no nap -- maybe I absorbed more caffeine than I thought. Very easy to meditate.  Definitely coming down, but slowly.

Summary: a very relaxing experience, with a quick 'up', slow 'down', just about ideal.</bodytext></report>
