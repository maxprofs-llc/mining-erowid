Until recently, I was a heavy cannabis user--an abuser, really. For the past three years at least I had smoked three to five times per day: driving on the way to work, on the way home, alone in my apartment, etc. Then, about three weeks ago, I threw my last half-burned joint out of the window of my car and haven't smoked since, determined that I wouldn't do so again until I could convince myself that I could live my life without dependence.

There has been much debate on whether or not heavy marijuana users are likely to experience any withdrawal symptoms; some sources say none exist, others say moderate ones are to be expected. I would like to add my two cents to the debate with an endorsement of the former theory. I have experienced none of the classic withdrawal symptoms since I quit (save the occasional craving to light up, but I suppose that's more out of habit than anything). Moreover, it's like my consciousness has been lifted out of a fog. In the admittedly short time since I stopped, I've eaten better, I've been more alert and able to focus and concentrate, and I've been much more sociable, and my mood has generally improved.

I'm not cancelling my membership with NORML, and I imagine I'll light up again sometime, possibly in the not-too-distant future. But having tasted and remembered the virtues of sobriety once again, I'm not going to let myself slip back into the abusive habits in which I let so much of my life slip away.</bodytext></report>
