Hey All, I thought I'd sumbit a report on my hydromorphone addiction, because of it's expensive street price people dont really support an addiction of it purely, but when you get perscriptions like I did you can easily become addicted.

My first taste of D came when a friend asked one day while we were smoking weed 'Hey man whats hydromorph...?' 'I immediatly freaked out, 'HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT??'. It turned out he was being perscribed 1 mg pills for his gout. I purchased 3 of them several times for 5 bucks a piece, and snorted them, it was AMAZING, heaviest nods of my life.

I've been having chronic daily migraines for a year and a half now and I've been perscribed loads of narcotics, demerol, morphine, codeine, percocet, and good ol' dilaudid to name a few. I started off just snorting the D as I had been with the morphine, but evemtually my tolerance started to grow so I knew I needed something more because snorting dilaudid is only 50% as effective as shooting. So I went to the clinic for an app. and while I was waiting for the doc I stole some syringes that were sitting in the cuppboard, went home, locked myself in the bathroom, and tried whacking the dilaudid.

It took a few times to hit a good vein but I finally registered 3 4 mg pills into my vein on the side of my left arm, and wow. The feeling of slamming dilaudid is amazing, it starts off as a slight warmth and creaps up to my brain until finally my brain goes off with a gentle explosion of warmth that fills my entire body from head to toe, into my fingertips, it envelops my whole body. The first shot I took I remember layin on the bed smokin a bowl of hash in a waterbong, and I'd keep noddin out and pourin bong water all over myself, I was in heaven. I couldnt even walk straight.

For the next few days I was CONTSANTLY in the bathroom shootin up, I would slam the sleeping pills I was bein scripted, ritalin I bummed offa friend with ADD, I would do a cocktail of ritalin, caffeine pills, and Dillies, I just LOVED fixing, the rush, the needle, everything about it. Finally after a few days I got busted. My Mom had found all my syringes. I found where she was hiding them and continued to shoot up with a few needles I had, they went incredibly dull from re-use. They'd bruise the living shyte out of my viens, and tear my skin as I stuck them in. But finally she found those too and I was forced to stop.

Well I continued snorting the D's but I was developing such a tolerance that I needed somethin stronger. So I went to the doc and she put me on Hydromorph contin, 12 mg time release caps. I'd snort these but they were such a bitch to sniff because of all the wax in the little beads, so I was mostly crushing the beads and eating about 5 or 6 caps at a time for a really pleasent oral high.

I went back to the doctor and said I didnt like the Contin and was put back on the K4's. I had also asked for a shot of a narcotic, but this certain doc didnt like giving injections of narcotics so she perscribed ampoules of a take home NSAID (non-steriodal[sp] anti inflamatory drug) named toradol and a hefty supply of syringes, oh boy.
/n

When I started using the syringes I didnt wanna smack them because I knew my mom would get suspicous again, so I would just skin and muscle pop the drugs, I had aqquired a lovely ammount of the Contin caps saved up because they were so usless to sniff, so I skin popped those like nuts, and was skin poppin codeine pills like nuts, and some morphin I had saved up. Finally I got bored with poppin and I wanted to IV again, I told myself I'd smack once in awhile and continue to skin pop. Well as soon as I shot that first shot I fell in love all over again, I never popped again after that. No matter how bruised and worn my veins got I'd force myself to register a vein, no matter how bloody the syringe got, or no matter how long it took, I eventually collapsed the vein in the crook of my left arm. My Arm was turning completly yellow from the colour of the pills, pumping so many pills into my veins. I had even saved a couple of contin caps and shot those, WOW. the rush of 24 mg's was the most intense rush EVER. I was sitting on the toilet and BAM my whole body was overcome with the most guilty bliss and I immediatly nodded out untill someone pounded on the door to tell me to get outta the bathroom.

Thinkin back on this whole deal, I went from sniffin 2-3 mg's and noddin like a baby to shooting enough of the shit to kill a non tolerant person. because I had a constant supply I never had to face junk sickness in my active addiction, except in the mornings when I woke up. So the first thing I did every morning was crush up some pills, go in the bathroom, turn on the shower and knock myself out.
/n
/n
Finally one day I woke up, shot up a very delicious 20 mg's, smoked a bowl, and had a psychotic breakdown. I slit my wrist twice that day, tried to stab my brother and mom, and they called the cops. 2 paramedics and 4 cops came and dragged me to the hospital where I was screaming things like 'I HOPE YOU DIE' and 'JUST ONE MORE FUCKING HIT' they heavily sedated me on lorazepam and forced me to stay in the psychward for about 4 days, and perscribed me a lowering dose of dilaudid which they watched me take. When I came out of the hospital I saw some ugly UGLY withdrawals. I didnt sleep for 2 weeks, I'd be constantly exhasuted to the point of passing out then being awoken by a surge of burning hot energy rushing my body, then it'd leave me with a freezing chill thatd last days, I was constantly in the bathroom crapping my guts out, my whole body ached, my gut was so painfull, I couldnt eat for the whole 2 weeks, choking on the bile I couldnt puke up, it was hell.

When I came out of the hospital I made a choice to start going to Narcotics Anonymous, there they helped me clean up nowadays I'm 60 days clean today (jan 13th 2004) and dont even smoke weed anymore.
