Well, I always liked opiates all kinds!! And the other day I found a 15 mg time release morphine tablet. So, after reading all the differant ways to try this little gem, I decided to snort it.  I am sort of the cautious type and somewhat of a lite weight. Anyways. I think I must have snorted somewhere in the dose range of about 7-8 mg. Not much.  But, I did not feel any burning sensation in my nose.  It started to come on in about 15 minutes.  That warm fuzzy opiate feeling that I get.

At that small a dose it was pleasent. Music was interesting. It gradually wore off and  I remember having some pretty weird dreams.</bodytext></report>
