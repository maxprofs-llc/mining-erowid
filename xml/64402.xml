I used to trip on a very regular basis, but it had been over a year since I last tripped, and wanted to trip again. I decided to start cultivating my own mushrooms for personal consumption again, but while waiting on that ordered two new things I've always wanted to try but never have. I purchased ~30g dried peruvian torch flesh and 10 seeds of hawaiian baby woodrose. I decided first to try the HBWR the other day, and have yet to consume the peruvian torch.

I meticulously peeled the seeds, and for further measure wet them and rubbed off anything else that I couldnt get with a knife point or fingernails alone. I let these dry overnight, and the next morning crushed them in a garlic press. I then soaked the seeds in rather small amount of distilled water for approximately 3 hours, and ran a few errands. When I returned I put some water on the stove and prepared two mugs of ginger green tea, one for prior to ingestion and one to immediately follow ingestion. I had heard a number of complaints of serious stomach upset from the seeds, and hoped the ginger would help ease any discomfort. I strained any large chunks of seed out of the extract, leaving a slightly gritty but clear liquid with a color similar to a pale golden liquor. This I mixed with a good quantity of orange juice to help mask any potentially unpleasant flavor, which it did beautifully.

In about 20-30 minutes I began feeling lethargic and experienced a pronounced pain in the stomach, but no nausea. I decided to go lay down in bed for a while, to help calm my stomach and nerves. I lay with my eyes closed for almost the entire time, and drifted in and out of dreamlike visions and distinct but mild CEVs. I cannot, at this moment, remember all that I witnessed, and of course at 10 seeds it was not the most visually intricate or distinct of visual phenomena, but it was very present indeed. I do remember a vast field of nothing, with points of white/blue light that was shifting between being stars and being blocks, eminating from the center of a nonexistant cross. That is to say, there were four fields of these regularly spaced lights with space between each field. I remember more intricate and far less describable visual patterning, which rippled like the surface of a lake. Colors were hard to describe, and more often left simply the impression of a color, but I seem to have the impression of many oranges, reds, greens and blues.

A number of odd images briefly flashed in my minds eye but were elusive and hard to identify, let alone describe. I slipped often between the closed eye patterns and a dreamy state, the effects were very psychedelic at this point but I still also felt quite tired, and haven't any idea whether I really kept falling asleep and actually dreaming for brief periods, or if I was simply having particularly strong visions. It wasn't like normal dreams I have, but neither was it anything at all like the normal visuals I've experienced with psychedelics.

The previous visions and experiences made up about the first two hours of the experience, which really surprised and excited me. Upon rising from this trancelike state, I felt no nausea but a continued pain in the gut, which didn't leave until the effects diminished entirely. While I didn't feel sick, I knew I must purge and went to the bathroom to do so, and felt quite better afterwards. I was feeling exhilerated, and the effect was still strong and reminded me very much of the feeling of mushrooms or acid, but I was to find the 2 hour come up was to include the most intense effects I would receive from the seeds alone.
/n
/n
I knew I had a long way to go, and was unsure if the effects would keep increasing, or taper away very, very slowly. I was unaware I'd experienced a peak very early on, and decided to wait and find out. So I went to my living room and smoked a bong and drank some water while watching Labyrinth. After the movie, I realized the marijuana made the experience more pleasant, but I had reached the highest level of intensity there would be and passed it for good.

It had been quite a while since tripping, but I had some 10x salvia divinorum extract left from a long while ago. My original experiences with salvia were very positive and spiritual, but later on I began having only quite frightening trips which were hard to handle, and this caused me to go a long, long time without using it. I suspected that being in an already fairly psychedelic state, it may be easier for me to make the transition into the other reality of salvia, and decided to test this hypothesis. I settled into bed and prepared a very small test hit, just to give me a reminder of what a heavier experience would be like, to help me decide whether I really wanted to proceed.
/n
/n
Upon smoking this tiny hit I closed my eyes and noticed a definite but mild shift in consciousness to begin with, followed by very fluid and flowing visual patterning. I got some very real effects and handled the experience beautifully, and really enjoyed the lovely imagery and unusual mindset of the salvia experience, mild though it was. As I returned to mostly normal reality, I decided I did in fact wish to proceed into a much more profound excursion, but still did not wish to overdo things. I put in a hit about twice as big as the previous one, but still a small hit.
/n

Upon smoking this and again closing my eyes, the visual patterning returned quite strongly and became a whirling tornado of patterns and color. I began to lose any and all knowledge of my body and my life outside of this other dimension. My existance was purely spiritual and mental, a point of awareness and being with no name or face, but which surely could see. The patterning wrapped itself around me, circling, and then split into an upper and lower portion, each spinning another way. The patterns quickly gave way to the more otherworldly space, as I broke through and came into a physically different place. I had the sense of rising, but rising through the earth, into a cavern deep within the earth.
/n

This cavern was full of colors and intricate designs, and was inhabited by some sort of object containing an entity or entities, a multifaceted object with a machinelike exoskeleton, but with facets like shining jewels. Each facet seemed to be a face or eye, but it was unclear if every one was different or all the same entity. It spoke to me as one, welcoming me and calling me by name, reminding me who I was. Oddly, I was the one communicating telepathically, repeatedly stating that I'd returned. I take this to be a statement of humility and accomplishment simultaneously, as well as one of reverence. I feel as though the past few heavy trips had taken me to a hellish realm which was a form of punishment for misusing this substance, whereas initially I received wonderful visions of deities, witnessed spontaneous healing of a loved one, was privvy to what goes on 'behind the scenes.' My statement and feeling of having returned was quite significant, implying not only that I'd returned, but that I'd learned from mistakes and wish to approach carefully and humbly now, and wish to learn what can be taught.

As is usually the case with significant salvia trips, right as I was becoming reoriented in my new environment I was pushed back down into normal reality, back into my head. My eyes snapped open. I could see my room, but could not figure out yet where or who I was, and it took several minutes of lying there to reorient myself with ordinary reality. At first, I even felt as though I may have gone back to the wrong place, into someone else's head, in fact I felt like my head was in the right place, but I felt my body as being directly beneath my head standing upright, not in front of my head laying down as I could see this person doing. I felt my hand on my chest, but didn't know for sure if I was alone or not. Was it my hand? My chest? Could I be sure they were both mine? I could still sense the presence of the entity to the left of me, but could see nothing out of the ordinary.

As I finally came to grips with everything I looked at a clock - the two salvia trips had taken about 25-30 minutes. I kept waiting to come down completely from the salvia until I remembered that I had taken the hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, and would not return to baseline for probably another four hours at least. I spent a while just sitting outdoors on my balcony reflecting on my salvia trips, and drinking water. I soon made some food for myself, as it was the middle of the afternoon and I'd yet to eat. After a while of just being still and quiet, I went back indoors and just decided to watch some TV for a while and smoke some more bonghits. The very last effects were diminishing around 9 and a half hours, and I enjoyed a small drink of gin and a homebrew now that my stomach was feeling better. Sleep came easily later that night, and I felt well rested the next day.

All in all I'm quite surprised with the experience. I'm particularly surprised at the intensity of the trip during the come up, and the trancelike state I experienced initially. As mild as the rest of the trip was (sans Salvia) I was shocked at the effects I received initially. I was quite pleased with the effects of the HBWR, and noted remarkable mental clarity throughout the experience. I will definitely try these seeds again, both by themselves in a higher dose and in the same dose in addition to some cubensis mushrooms.</bodytext></report>
