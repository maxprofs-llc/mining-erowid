Well I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. Insufflating (snorting) 5-htp is a bad idea. I'm a smoker, about a pack a day, and after snorting a wee bit of 5-htp, my lungs went south. It took about 20 min for my coughing to subside. I have snorted other *cough* things in the past but never had problems like this before. Other than that first 20 - 30 min of coughing I had a pleasant evening. So for future reference I wouldn't snort this stuff.
