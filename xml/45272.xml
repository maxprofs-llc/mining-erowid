A while back, a friend of mine bought a gram of 5-MeO-DiPT. Having done 5-Meo-DMT previously, I was looking forward to a great time. The only reason he bought this stuff was because it was ~$100 cheaper than the DMT. It's cheaper for a reason. And probably not because it's easier to make. So me and my friends (S and B) head over to my house to divide it and put it into pills.

We start eyeballing lines, making sure to get them small and even (smaller than a 2C- hit). There is so much of the stuff that it starts getting into the air and I get a small buzz from dividing out most of it. When it is in the capsules, I take roughly 10 mg. As soon as I start getting a buzz, I also get very sick.

I can't throw up so I just sit there on the couch in agony for the next four hours. All I did the whole time was watch TV and wish I hadn't taken this stuff. I'm glad it doesn't last as long as 2C-. This stuff messes me up but it's not really psychedelic. No real open-eye hallucinations, everything just looks shaky. It does something strange to my  hearing, like my head is underwater. The feeling it gives in my head isn't really pleasant, it's basically a headache. I realized that just because something has a 5-MeO on it doesn't make it good.

After taking this crap, I waited about 6 months before taking it again and still had an awful time when I did it.</bodytext></report>
