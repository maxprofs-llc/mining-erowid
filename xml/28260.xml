I had recently acquired 100mg of IAP.  One day while home alone, having nothing to do, I decided to try it out.  I attempted to weigh out the material using the liquid measurement technique (which I had previously used with great success on 2C-I).  I sprinkled 100mg of the IAP (a pure white powder) into 10ml of water in a very small bottle, put the cap on, and shook the bottle.  And shook.  And shook.  And shook.  Little to none of the powder was being dissolved.  I warmed the bottle by placing it in hot water, then repeated the shaking process several times more.  No change.  I guess I should break down and buy a scale.  But I was eager to try the substance nonetheless, so I vigorously shook up the bottle so that the tiny specks of IAP were more or less evenly floating around in the water and then immediately withdrew 2ml of the liquid before the IAP got a chance to settle much.  So I was able to obtain  (very) roughly 20mg of the compound.

I swallowed the liquid/powder, followed by a glass of water to wash out the rather bitter taste.  Now I should mention that I tend to be particularly nervous when it comes to trying new psychoactive substances (especially one like IAP where there is little information about duration and effects available), thus it can sometimes be hard for me to distinguish the initial effects of a drug from the physical and psychological manifestations of my anxiety.  In about 15 mins I started feeling some fairly heavy tension (a tight, clenching feeling, though not particularly painful) around the jaw/neck/shoulders area with some teeth grinding.  This lasted about an hour or two, gradually subsiding.  I also began experiencing some stomach weirdness (not quite nausea, but close) which also diminished over the next hour or so.  There were occasional waves of a non-specific pleasurable feeling, but my overall feeling was one of mild anxiety.  To relax, I lay down on my couch for a while and started reading.  I began gradually more and more engrossed in my reading  (to a degree unusual for me) and focused less and less on the effects of the IAP.

About 2 hours after I ingested the IAP, I got up from the couch to get something, and thats when I really started to notice the effects.  My head and body felt rather swimmy, I felt slightly disoriented, and my vision was somewhat unfocused.  There also seemed to be a very slightly psychedelic edge to the experience.  The afterimage of bright objects seemed especially pronounced, with perhaps some very mild tracer effects.  The unexpected intensity of these effects as I got up and moved around caused another episode of mild anxiety.  I lay back down on the couch and turned on the TV.  I ended up watching a debate on the death penalty between a federal judge and a famous trial lawyer.  I found myself unusually engaged in and fascinated by the discussion.  Not only was I very engaged in the moral, social and legal aspects of the debate, but I was also fascinated by the personality characteristics and quirks of the two speakers, and found the way those traits clashed to be quite hilarious.

As I focused on the discussion my anxiety once again subsided, to be replaced with a very relaxed, drowsy, pleasant sensation which lasted for two or three hours.  I suspect that the IAP caused a major release of serotonin into my bloodstream.  I wouldnt call the experience ecstatic or euphoric, however.  Although pleasant and relaxing, there was also a feeling of emotional neutrality.  It wasnt so much HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY, LIFE IS WONDERFUL!, but more like This isnt so bad. Everything is OK.  Id say I was back at baseline about six hours after ingesting the IAP.  I had a bit of a headache of the rest of the evening.

Reading and watching television were definitely more engaging and enjoyable.  However, to my disappointment, the IAP didnt seem to enhance musical appreciation at all.  I was alone at the time, so I couldnt say how it affects social interaction, but my guess would be that it would be more relaxed.

Many of the IAP reports on the net mention a good synergy with alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs.  Although I no longer use alcohol or marijuana, I can definitely see IAP adding to the experience of both of those drugs.  The relaxation and drowsiness did resemble alcohol, although there was none of the mental confusion or propensity towards stupid and destructive behavior that alcohol creates.  Although IAP definitely has a unique vibe, Id say the drug Ive used that resembles it most would be hydrocodone, with its physical and mental relaxation and relative lack of mental cloudiness or negativity.  An IAP/hydrocodone combination might be worth exploring.</bodytext></report>
