A few of my friends at school told me that taking 8 dramamine pills or so will get you really fucked up.  Not being one to act on an impulse, I evaluated the reports on the net and decided it seemed pretty safe to try.  My friend had given me 20 pills (50 mg each) last week so the following Saturday I decided to give it a try.  I was aware that dramamine makes you tired, so in order to counteract that nasty side effect, I drank a double capuccino before my trip (I do not drink coffee often, so I am sensitive to caffeine).  I started by keeping notes of my actions by time:
/n
/n
7:45 - took one pill to test for allergic reaction
/n
8:15 - no reaction so far; take 2 more pills
/n
8:30 - slight muscle tension and uneasiness; possibly due to caffeine and/or anticipation; take 2 more pills
/n
8:45 - slight trails, a bit of an enhanced feeling; take 1 more pill for an even 6
/n
8:50 - Eh, what the hell, take 2 more pills
/n
9:10 - definitely feeling something; sort of like alcohol buzz but not quite as uncoordinated; take 2 more pills (making 10 total)
/n
9:30 - body feeling heavy; difficult to move; skin numb; muscles twitching slightly
/n
9:45 - staring at the carpet, small, clear, jelly-like blobs moving across the floor; movements in corners of eyes; considering taking 2 more pills
/n
10:00 - very distinct visuals on wall; looks like walls have skin that moves with something underneath; getting difficult to walk (and write neatly)
/n
10:00 - take 2 more pills for good measure (12 total)
/n
10:10 - damn, it's really starting now; looked at reflection in mirror, it looks like someone else is staring at me, very eerie; keep seeing movement in corners of eyes
/n
10:13 - distinctly saw spider on my arm, but when I went to flick it off, it disappeared
/n
10:15 - my carpet looks like a sheet of granite; a pair of shorts on the floor looks like they are moving, but there is no wind in the room; I can hear voices, but they sound like they are inside my head
/n
10:30 - The voices are definitely coming from outside now
/n
10:35 - Keep focusing on random things, can't really think/write
/n
10:45 - Definitely feeling it; bad memory; red wax = ladybug
/n
10:50 - glob on paper
/n
/n
At this point I lost it completely.  My handwriting got progressively worse as those notes went on until I just couldn't even write anymore.  The red wax thing, I think, was a dripping of candlewax that I kept thinking was a ladybug.  At this point I decided to walk downstairs (not an easy task).  I sat, or rather fell, down onto the sofa.  My dad was watching TV and he said something to me (I think).  I remember talking to him and knowing that I was slurring my words together horribly, but I couldn't help it.  He just looked at me kind of funny.  When I got up to turn the TV off, I saw this thing by the speaker that scared the crap out of me.  It looked like this alien being, about 3 or 4 inches in diameter.  It was brown, with an eye in the middle and three tentacles and spun around wildly like it was going to attack me, hovering about 6 inches above the ground.  I distinctly saw it and even though I knew I was tripping I still could not convince myself it wasn't real until it went around a corner and disappeared.  I saw it again a couple of times and it scared me every time.

I don't really remember what I did after that but I know I walked around my house somewhere before going to my room and smoking half a bowl of MJ to calm myself down, as I was starting to freak out a little.  I climbed into my bed and I remember being afraid of something, but I don't know what.  Throughout the trip I had been slipping into a dreamlike state where I was at a house doing roofwork (I had been doing this previously that day).  I really felt like I was there and heard people talking to me distinctly and then suddenly I would 'wake up' and it would take a few seconds for me to realize it was just a dream.  I was not asleep though; this happened when I was standing up a couple of times.  Anyway, I went to bed, but I kept waking up about every 15 minutes or so for no reason.  Each time it seemed like I had slept for a few hours.  This continued for about 2 hours.  When I woke up, I actually felt pretty good.  It wasn't until I started walking around that I realized how drained I was.  I was starving but I didn't eat anything because I didn't feel like chewing.  That's how tired I felt.

When I got out of the shower (which felt amazingly good), I saw that alien thing again and I screamed out loud.  It disappeared right away this time.  Throughout the day, I felt really isolated and depressed; I wanted to go sit in the fetal position in the corner, but I restrained myself.  I saw a couple of hallucinations that lasted a couple of seconds each throughout the day, including a fly that buzzed around my head before disappearing into thin air.  By the evening, I was pretty much back to normal.

Overall, I wouldn't not recommend the dramamine trip, but I wouldn't exactly recommend it either, especially if you have access to acid, which I only occasionally do.  Certainly not a recreational drug, as it is impossible to interact with other people, or even do anything that requires physical effort.  Don't plan on doing anything the next day either.  I suppose I could have gone to school or work if I had to but I would have had a really tough time.</bodytext></report>
