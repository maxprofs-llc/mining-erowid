I am writing this report for the Mental Safety of People using Salvia Divinorum in COMBINATION with other substances (I see NO PROBLEM with Salvia Divinorum ALONE).  Salvia Divinorum is a Lovely Experience to me, but recently I have had problems with COMBINATIONS.  I used Syrian Rue extract (3g dried seed Equivalent) in combination with a VERY VERY small amount of Salvia Divinorum (a couple flakes).  I had Overwhelming effects similar to 5-Meo-Dmt.  I could not understand why it felt this way.  To me it was quite uncomfortable.  It lasted longer (35-45 minutes) then the usual 3-5 minutes WITHOUT ANY 'Psychedelic' effect and only produced fearful overwhelmingness.  I have done Salvia over 40 times and havn't EVER had this happen before.  It's always been a great experience.  I am used to high amounts and none ever did this (this was also a VERY VERY small amount) to me.

Then I tried Salvia Divinorum with Nyquil (not at all thinking about it).  I used the Nyquil to get me to sleep, but I was not sick at all.  I took 2 tbsp of Best Choice immitation Nyquil and for some reason decided to try Salvia Divinorum.  I smoked Two flakes again cause you can never be too cautious, and held it in for no more then 1 second (which I think was pathetic, but I did it to make sure I didn't regret it).  Not even 5 seconds after that an Overwhelming fearful sensation came over me again (Similair to 5-Meo-Dmt).  It lasted 30-45 minutes.  I kept having to take deep breaths and try not to panic.  Eventually I came down (just for the record I also smoked 7 Marlboro red ciggeretes within 2 hrs time span 30 minutes BEFORE I took Nyquil or smoked the Salvia.  I don't know if this made it worse or not).

Several days later (in which I have done no Drugs or smoked any ciggerets and drank no alcohol or done anything) out of nowhere I felt the EXACT overwhelming sensations (similair to 5-Meo-Dmt or the ALARM of 7g Psilocybe Mushrooms with 3g Syrian Rue) and I tried not to panic, but this time 'Reality' was shifting and the 'normal World' including my 'Ego' was dissolving (around Public or by yourself this is not normally great).  I felt extreme fear (more then before) and felt extremely horrible.  It lasted 4-5 hours.  I can handle ALOT of Chemicals but this was crazy.  Just for the record I also have tripped over 300 times and have NEVER EVER had have this happen to me BEFORE THE COMBINATIONS (Salvia ALONE DOES NOTHING NEGATIVE and I mean NOTHING or at least for me).  The overwhelming 'flashbacks' have been happening for 3 days now 18 hours a day (except when sleeping 5-6 hours) non stop and has been litterly hell.  I wake up hopeing for it to be over and only to find out it's still there hounding me.  It's now (as I write this) gradually decreasing with 'TIME' and am feeling WAY better.

Also for the record I fasted 5 days and 10 hours, drank no water for 30 hrs, slept only 1-5 hours durring the fast and dehydration, and the damn airplane crashes happened all durring this 'time' and I was also upset by all the recent happenings (not understanding how people can be so cruel) BEFORE the Overwhelmings effects happened but in no way did I think it would cause an Overwhelming 5-meo-Dmt sensation because of all this (who knows maybe lots of people are feeling this overwhelmingness because of all the event recently and maybe that's all).  The fact that it felt JUST like the Immitation NYQUIL and Salvia combination and the Syrian Rue and Salvia combination (only MORE overwhelming) made me think it HAD to have been the COMBINATIONS.  One ODD thing though, I actually kept hearing buzzing sounds BEFORE the overwhelmingness happened.  EVERY time on the dot.  It could have been electo pollution alone though.  I am so confused about this.

Whatever anyone does, just be VERY careful in MIXING Salvia with other SUBSTANCES (Nyquil, Syrian Rue, Coleus Plants, or lots of Ciggeretes, Electrical Fields and who knows how many others).  I just want people to keep their Psychology safe and not have to experience this.  Stress, Fasting, Dehydration, Sleep Deprivation, Electrical Fields I am sure affect Salvia Divinorum.  It's NOT THE SALVIA DIVINORUM ALONE that you have to worry about.  It's the COMBINATIONS.  Repeat COMBINATIONS.  Salvia ALONE appears Safe and GREAT to me.  Be VERY carefull with combinations.  In NO WAY do I intend to scare people or make Salvia look bad but I would hate for someone to screw their mind up and end up freaking or something and end up giving Salvia a bad name because of NOT being cautious.  I listed everything that COULD have been responsible for this reaction.  Combinations COULD alter brain chemestry permanently or at least for a while (hopefully not for the rest of my life).  As I said be very very careful.  I would like to know if other people have had these reactions because of combinations or maybe because of the events lately.</bodytext></report>
