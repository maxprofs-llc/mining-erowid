I have arthritis. My doctor had prescribed me these Tramadol 50mg Tablets for pain. I knew that tramadol had some recreational value so I decided to check it out.

After researching, I decided to take 250mg (5 tablets) this was at approx. 6:00P.M. No later than 6:30P.M, I was already feeling the effects of the tramadol. The effects were much like marijuana, a happy, euphoric-like high. Here's the details:

After swallowing the 5 tablets, I stepped outside to smoke a joint. After finishing the joint, I came back inside and sat down at the computer and began to talk with one of my friends. About 10min into our conversation, I noticed my vision was beginning to blur and I had a warm, fuzzy feeling about me. Especially *in* my head. It was almost like a humming feeling, quite pleasant. These effects over time had doubled in severity. By approx. 6:45P.M, my vision was entirely blurred and the 'humming' in my head had grown as well. All in all, it was a wonderful, plesant experience. Next time, I'll try a higher dose maybe 400mg?</bodytext></report>
