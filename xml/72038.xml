After losing my patience with cooking out kratom for about 20 minutes and more to get satisfied results I tried my little espresso machine (you know, that kind of really old school machines you have to unscrew to get the coffee in) and did in (well, the first time way to much) some kratom. I worked perfectly. Now I have a really nice tea in less than 5 minutes with no stirring or much of a washing afterwards.</bodytext></report>
