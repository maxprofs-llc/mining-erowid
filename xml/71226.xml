I'm a 19 years old male studying mathematics and physics, for difficult exams that just took place. Since I needed all the edge I could get, I decided a few months ago to try a nootropics regimen. I read that piracetam was great to improve learning and creativity, so I thought I'd give it a try. I had read that piracetam does wonders for some people, and seems to be completely uneffective on some others, but I had great expectations for that product. My experience with other psychoactives is very limited: coffee, alcohol, pot (once or twice in my life) and that's all.

I ordered bulk piracetam power online, since piracetam (under brand Nootropil) is only available on prescription in France, where I live. The powder is crystalline, sugar-like, but has a unpleasant smell. It dissolves pretty well in water, and it has a bitter taste, not very bad, but the first time I tried it, it left me somewhat disgusted. Now I got used to it.

The first day, I started with an attack dose at noon (I had received the powder in the morning) of 3.6g of piracetam, with 2 softgels of choline (containing 420mg of phosphatidylcholine each). The effects set in about an hour. I didn't feel smarter, or more awake, so I was a little bit disappointed at first. But when I started to work, I realized that I could focus much more on my task, and that the ideas were flowing more easily. Later that day, I had a session of team work, where I was smarter and more creative than usual. I was quite happy with the effects of piracetam - they were subtle, but definitely existant and clearly distinguishible from placebo. On Shulgin scale, I guess this would amount to between + and ++.

I continued to take piracetam every day since, 2.4g (measured on a pocket scale, accurate to a tenth of a gram) three times a day at 6am, at noon, and around 5pm, dissolved in half a glass of water, sometimes on an empty stomach, sometimes not. I also take choline at the same times, 2 softgels that contain 420mg of phosphatidyl choline each, three times per day. On total, I take 7.2g or piracetam and 2.52g of phosphatidylcholine daily.

I believe the effects are still present, but I got used to it. My thinking has become clearer, and ideas flow more easily. My memory, both short-term, long-term, and formation of new memories are even better than they were before, though I've always had a really good memory. My mood may have improved also, but I believe this is related to the increase in my intellectual faculties, since my mood is heavily correlated to how I perceive their performance. The better I perform, the happier I am, because of the exams I had in sight.

Piracetam don't make me feel high, but I'm simply more efficient when I have to use my brain. I feel like I can rely on it much more than before. I don't feel more awake - even if it does keep me awake when I take some, late in the evening. I tend to find words more easily on piracetam as well, and my ability to imagine things in 3D may also be a little bit better. Another nice effect is that piracetam improved my perception of music. Music feels much deeper, I have a much better perception of each of its contituants (the instruments, the effects, the lyrics, etc.) It's very enjoyable. Otherwise, unlike some other people reported, I didn't feel like Mr Spock, nor had especially vivid dreams, nor did my interests change. And absolutely no physical effects (change in heatbeat, etc.), and no side effects (headaches, etc.) whatsoever.

Since piracetam effects are somewhat subtle, I can't give an estimate of the time of onset nor of the time required for its effects to disappear. I spread my doses throughout the day so piracetam is present in my system when I need it (from 6am to 8pm), and it doesn't prevent me from sleeping, around 9pm.

Now that I've taken the exams, I think that I'm going to continue to take piracetam. It's a nice and cheap drugs, with nice subtle effects. I liked that experience, and I recommend piracetam to my friends, but I'm going to try to find some more powerful alternatives. I'd like to feel boosted by some kind of substance, and piracetam is too subtle for that. I've ordered oxiracetam, and I'm waiting for the package.</bodytext></report>
