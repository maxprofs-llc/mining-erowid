I have taken piracetam, vinpocetine and hydergine and by far the most powerful is hydergine. One dose will not do much but if I drink a cup of coffee (for some reason coffee enhances absorbtion) with my dose I will feel the effects of the coffee magnified. If I combine it with piracetam vincpocetine and choline the result will be an intense stimulation which usually is unpleasent as it makes me nervous. When i take hydergine with coffee the effects are:
/n
/n
- I can memorize facts much faster (im a science student)
/n
- there is sometimes anxiety
/n
- I feel my mind has speed up (thoughts are fast)
/n
- Sometimes I get a headache although usually this is present when it is combined with piracetam and vinpocetine.
/n
- The effects could be compared to a mild dose of ephedrine but without the B adernergic stimulation.
/n
/n
I think the important thing here is to absorb as much hydergine as possible hence I find drinking it with coffee is the best route (I researched this fact and if anybody doubts it I encourage you to look in Martindales 1975 pharmacopia under hydergine).</bodytext></report>
