In this report I will tell you about what I call 'the flowers', or brugmansia. Brugmansia seems to be the tree form of Datura, and it grows everywhere. I discovered the psychoactive effects of brugmansia about 2 years ago, and I have tripped on them about 8 times now. Never having a 'bad' trip, but to some people every trip on brugmansia would be a 'bad' one. It's not for everyone.

I'll begin with the effects. The comeup and the peak have almost totally different effects, so I will divide this into two lists of effects, comeup and peak. The comeup can take up to 5 hours. The effects are: Severe dry mouth/throat, blurred close vision, loss of co-ordination (like being really drunk), confusion, dilated pupils, lazy/vegetative like mood, general uncomfortable feeling/lack of ability to get comfortable, nausea/stomach discomfort. The peak can last up to 6 hours. The effects are: Severe dry mouth/throat, blurred vision, dilated pupils, amnesia, delerium, vivid hallucinations: seeing and talking to people who aren't there, picking things up off the ground that aren't there, drinking out of invisible objects, things twitch, move, bend, squirm etc.

What makes this drug so strong is the intense confusion, delerium and vivid hallucination combo. Because I am so mentally confused and the hallucinations look so real and not 'strange' (most of the hallucinations look like everyday things, like a cup of water, or my friend from school) that I do not know I am tripping/hallucinating. I think everything is real and so this is a very, very, very hard drug to 'control' or conceal. I don't really consider it a very fun drug because while your on it it's not fun due to the discomfort, confusion, and not knowing I'm tripping. It's only fun afterward to remember all the crazy things I was doing/saying and how damn hard I was tripping! Usually having people there with me that can tell me what I was doing helps bring back memories of the trip.

Ok now I will talk about preparations. I have simply eaten the flowers alot of times and it makes me gag thinking about it, not fun. I have also made tea, ingested the seeds, and used a soak and evaporation process to make a powder extract of the flowers, this produced the most potent trip. I recommend making tea, it's the easiest to get down, and easy to make. My dose is 4 flowers, no stems or pollen things on the inside. just the flowers.

I'll tell you about one of my trips on these flowers. I have chosen to tell you about this trip because it is the one I remember the most of, because my friends who were generally sober and watching me the whole night, told me what I was doing. Their stories of what they saw me doing that night brought back my own memories of the experience.

That night we had been drinking beer and smoking pot, when the idea to 'drink the tea' arose I was pretty drunk, and very high. I was hesitant because I had never done them while drunk, but I did anyways. After about 20 mins of drinking the tea the effects began, I think because I was already intoxicated is why the comeup was only 20 mins. Before my friends jogged my memory, all I remembered about the night the next day was after drinking the tea going to couch and laying down and going to sleep in boredom. But really after about 20 mins my friends said I was trying to walk around, having a very hard time keeping my balance, I kept bumping into things and mumbling to myself. I kept going over to the window and peeking out of it.

After about 1 hour they said I would start talking to invisible people, and when they would speak to me I would blankly stare at them and then go off doing my own thing, like I wasn't hearing them. They said I ended up laying on the ground, speaking in ethiopian (I can mimick the language very well as a joke). My friend K said that he tried to tell me to get off the ground, and I reacted by grabbing an invisible phone from his hand and bringing it to my ear and saying hello? All I remember now from that trip is the phone (it was my dad on the line) and seeing PLENTY of people that were never there and will never be there, and continuing to have conversations with them.

Having a sitter is very important. If it wasn't for someone sober being around, my friend B would've gotten lost and woken up somewhere he had no idea where he was. We had to hold on to his sweater and 'lead' him to a park because he kept wandering off into peoples yards. He was the only one under influence at the time. He mom also caught him putting his niece in the freezer, to him she looked like a box of ice cream. That's how strong the drug is and how real the hallucinations are. Blurred vision can last up to a week.</bodytext></report>
