Wow! In the past I have thought that /n was 'fun but interesting.' Well, it is very interesting, but also /n powerful. I smoked alone inside my home at night. I saw a whirlwind of cobras so incredible that it literally made me stop smoking for a second. I was afraid that it was going to wake up all of my neighborhood, and I'm sure that if I hadn't stopped that would have happened. I closed my eyes and the energy became two wheels of raw power, moving in opposite directions around me--even while I was locked in the most powerful position one can achieve--the lotus. I had to open my eyes and move a little bit to release energy. I closed my eyes again and fell gently into obscurity. I had the feeling that, while floating, I could try to reach friends; but I just couldn't think of what friend wouldn't have been disturbed by my apparition, whatever that would have been.

Two days later, I smoked with a friend outside in the mountains at night. The first attempt was somehow deceiving; as if, instead of bouncing on the walls back against me, the power was diluting itself among the stars. But now I look at this as if the /n was preparing me for what was coming.

On the second try, everything broke into patterns--but not African, Tibetan, or Indian patterns. No, it was just /n--sausages everywhere. Beyond these visual effects, suddenly and without any doubt I knew that I wasn't in the same universe. While laughing, I said to my friend, 'I'm talking to you from another dimension. My voice comes to you from a different reality.' It was so clear and so incredibly simple, that I was killing myself laughing. I was in another universe and I saw a very concrete frontier between my friend and I. As time passed, I slowly reintegrated my ordinary spatial and temporal coordinates.

On the third attempt the world exploded into... /n (why the hell sausages or mice... we've got a lot of dirt in our heads), but with eyes closed I saw that the mice, like laughs, were just flowery images that were keeping me from going deeper. I took deep breaths, concentrated on the energy, and I found myself in a /n universe. Larger spheres were rotating (some of them were in contact), and between them there was eternity. I said to my friend, 'It is obvious that, of course, I'm not here any more.'

/n is very powerful. I don't know what would happen if the effects weren't so short. I mean, this state is completely unknown. We don't have the slightest idea how to move in it. Still, it was so simple. I had two choices: acting as if I didn't know what was happening, and ranting and raving, 'What's that? What's that? What's happening to me?' or taking responsibility. And it was simple. I went to another dimension and it was so simple. In fact, the best definition I can give that some readers will understand is that I changed the place of my 'point of collection.'

A few questions: Are dried /n leaves potent when chewed? If yes, how much is needed, how long does the experience last, and does anyone have a clue as to how to act with it and use it shamanically? -- S.H., France
