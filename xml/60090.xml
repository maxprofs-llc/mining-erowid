A very long and high plateau was reached after about an hour and a half of a fairly strong push forward. It is quite reminiscent of my early experiments with low doses of LSD. There are marked difference though. It is not nearly as introspective, a bit more energetic, and  there is a slight loss of equilibrium. A novel compound in and of itself, for sure.</bodytext></report>
