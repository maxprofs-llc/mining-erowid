I took 20mg at 9pm.  At approx. 10:30, I was stunned by visuals while staring at the wood-paneling on my friend's living room wall.  From that point I had an intense feeling of weight on my body.  I was reluctant to move.  The weighted feeling did not return later.

After leaving my friend's house, I walked to the car, not recognizing exactly the surroundings that should have been familiar.  During the car ride, the air conditioning blowing on my legs creating a confusing signal, I couldn't tell if the air was very hot or very cold.  It felt as if someone rubbed Icey Hot all over my inner thigh.

When I got to my room I laid down on my bed (approx 11:30pm).  My feet felt like they were burning.  A tingling sensation seemed to run down one-side of my body, making me wonder if the drug was affecting only one side of my brain.  I had a strange tingling sensation in my testicles that was prevalent most of the trip (9pm-3am).

My thoughts seemed especially introspective and profound.  My thoughts flowed very well at times, and other times I would forget my thought mid-sentence, trying to explain it.  Sometimes I would dismiss thoughts as a product of being on a drug; it seemed to me that this was a result of the drug not totally encompassing me.

Overall, I would describe it as a 'dirty' physical high.  I didn't much care for how my body felt most of the night.  The drug was useful for therapeutic development, though, and much mental development was accomplished.  I realized several things about myself and my friends while on this drug.

It should be mentioned that I had someone around me at all times not taking any substances, which was probably very helpful.</bodytext></report>
