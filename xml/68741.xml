I've been having problems with dizziness and vertigo recently.  My doctor told me to use bonine (meclizine) as a temporary solution.  The chewables came as 25mg but I cut them with a knife along the line and took ~12.5mg as recommended.

Meclizine works pretty well for dizziness / vertego.  Side effects weren't that bad and were tolerated better on latter doses.  Initially I felt kind of tired and latter a little sedated.  It also made the vertigo a little worse during the first 30 minutes.

I'm on a prescription anti-histamine now that works a lot better but for a temporary fix for vertigo or dizziness OTC meclizine works.  The box probably won't say vertigo -- it's marketed for sea sickness or car rides.  I also take them differently for vertigo -- as needed up to 100mg/day instead of the instructed 25mg once daily.</bodytext></report>
