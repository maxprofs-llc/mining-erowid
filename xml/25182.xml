I've smoked salvia several times before.  I've seen some pretty intense stuff.  I once thought I was a chicken wing.  I once believed that the world did not exist outside of my field of vision.  This experience goes far beyond any of that.

It was the 4th of July.  A friend of mine from high school who I don't see often came to visit.  The evening started off with hamburgers and beer.  By the time the fireworks were over I'd had about 15 beers.  I was fairly intoxicated.  I went to my room with friends and we smoked a hookah for a while.  At some point I smoked a little marijuana.  Then I decided that it would be a good idea to smoke some salvia.

I grabbed the bong that I had made a few days earlier.  I packed a giant bowl with about 1/3 gram of 10x salvia.  I smoked the whole bowl in 2 rather large lungfuls.  According to my friend, at this point I dropped the bong and fell out of my chair onto the floor.  Apparently I also crawled across the room a little bit.

What happened inside my head is something I can barely explain.  I went to some far off distant world.  I had no concept of the reality I've known for most of my life.  All of my senses were overwhelmed with new and different things that I had never experienced before.  My vision zoomed rapidly from one intense sight to another.  Unfortunately I don't think any description can do justice to what I experienced.

Slowly I returned to reality.  It was very difficult.  I had totally forgotten about my previous life.  As it returned to me I had to exert quite a bit of effort to grab a hold of it.  It almost seemed as though the distant world I had been to was reality and everything else in my life had just been a dream.

Peak effects probably lasted about 10 minutes.  Fairly strong after-effects persisted until I went to bed about an hour later.

I'm pretty sure that the intensity of this experience was related to all of the alcohol I had consumed.</bodytext></report>
