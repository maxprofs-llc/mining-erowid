For lack of better control mechanisms, I have been using several software packages, including a database of several old GMAT CAT examinations(THE GMAT Verbal section is gerenally regarded as a measure of intellectual ability), and a memory recall speed and efficiency package.

Granted this is not a very good indication of what effects the drugs actually have, as I am just one person, and I have emotional, occupational, and other factors effecting my life, and hence, my test performance, but I thought that the data I collected may assist others considering a regimen of smart drugs. I will update things in a few more months.</bodytext></report>
