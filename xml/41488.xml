Using the pill for the past two years I have noticed that it helps me get to sleep.  I also notice that I have dreams toward the end of my sleep which sometimes makes it difficult to wake up.  These effects did not happen until the third week or so of once a day administration of the medicine.  The effect goes away after about two days of no pill.  And of course, I should also mention that I have acquired an occationational twitch if I try to speak quickly, and unconcertedly.  This twitch has not surfaced in the past months, but I am sure that they are not gone for good.  I hope this goes away when I stop the therapy.  I should also mention I gained about 45 pounds when on the pill.</bodytext></report>
