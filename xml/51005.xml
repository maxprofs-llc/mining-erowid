So I was really bored up at college this past summer.  I had tried duster before when I was high, and I loved it.  I did it quite a bit when I was blazed, but that was ok, just a little bit once and a while.

Anyway, I was really bored one afternoon, I probably did a good half of a can of this shit.  It was fun and I enjoyed, but just wait.  I'm getting ready for bed the next night.  I start walking to my bedroom in my apartment, then it came back to haunt me.  I started getting really fuzzy vision, like when I was taking hits off the can of duster. I started stumbling very badly, I couldn't breathe, and I finally fell over flat on my face.  I had blacked out, some time went by, I don't remember how much, I lifted my head, and stood up to go to bed.  This time I tried moving slower, I was going to get a glass of water, I could not, the same feeling came back over me.  I just went to my bed and finally gained my composure back and went to sleep.

Worst experience ever!!!  I honestly felt like like I was dying, and I probably could have that night.  I have tried it couple of times since, but I get scared every time I do it, cause I remember those horrible after effects.</bodytext></report>
