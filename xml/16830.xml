I am a diabetic who drinks Alcohol whenever I can get some. This is not so much a certain experience, but an overall experience. I have grown to learn that when I drink lets say anywhere from 4 to 11 beers one night the next day around 12:00 or so my blood sugar drops very low. Not only do I get low the next day I have a major hangover and it impairs my ability to tell if I'm low in the first place. So I have made a certain list of adaptations to dealing with my blood sugar while drinking.

1. I always check my blood level before I even start drinking to make sure I'm not starting off at a low level.

2. I always make sure that I check my blood level during the drunkiness. I know this sounds hard, but I keep track of numbers as much as possible so I know where I am.

3. I always let someone know or drink with someone who does know about diabetes. Also I make sure that person knows how to treat a low blood level if it should occur.

4. After I have fallen to sleep and I wake up the next morning with a pounding headache, I check my blood level to make sure it isn't low already.

*I am sure to check often the next day to ensure that I will catch the blood level falling. Cause it will fall at some point, I just have to figure out when!!!

I hope this helps some other fellow diabetic to keep it under control while drinking alcohol.</bodytext></report>
