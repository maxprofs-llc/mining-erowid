It was a beautiful October day, Halloween in fact. I had obtained a quarter of magic mushrooms from a good buddy. At the time I was sixteen, and about 130 pounds. Ive tripped on mushrooms many times. I smoke marijuana every day, and have also experimented with LSD, MDMA (In many different ecstasy pills, and in its pure powder form Molly.), Salvia Divinorum (the leaves and the 5x and 20x extracts), 5-MeO-DMT, Oxycodone, Codeine, Heroin, Cocaine, assorted amphetamines, Amitriptyline, Nutmeg, Opium, Morning Glory, Nitrous, Duster, and DXM. I had put a little less than half away at my house leaving me approximately four grams in my pocket. I called my friend C (who has also tripped many times) and asked if he would like to trip. He said of course so I found a ride to his house and went upstairs to his room.

T+00:00 In his room we split it up equally, mostly caps, but they were all quite small. We each ingested about two grams of it and headed out back to wait for it to come on. We smoke a couple bowls of Jerry Berry (very sweet fruity headies from Vermont).

T+00:25 Still feeling no effects, just very high off the buds.
/n
/n
T+00:45 Mild body tingle, starting to feel it a bit.
/n

T+01:00 Maybe it was just a wave. We head inside; sort of annoyed that it hasnt really hit us yet. By this time Cs mother had gotten home and we greeted her and headed back up to his room. We throw on the television, and watch a little of the Patriots game.

T+01:05 WHAM! Heeeerrrrreee it isssss. We both start to trip around the same time. No visuals yet, but Im definitely starting to trip. I felt pretty light-headed, and colors in the room seem brighter. I was breathing a little harder than usual. I feel a little uncomfortable, so we head downstairs and sit with his mom in the front room as shes watching a movie. We both admire the ceiling, which was gently moving around. We start to trip too hard to be around his mom so we head out the front door. Our good friend T and his band were throwing a little concert at this kids house a couple streets away so we decided to head there. As we leave, Cs mom is screaming at him What are you on? I know youre on drugs, what are you on??? We laugh very hard at this and leave anyway without saying anything.

T+01:15 The outdoors are gorgeous. The red, orange, and yellow leaves look magnificent. Everything is swaying and moving and dancing a gentle dance. The October sky is full blue and the air is cool and crisp.

T+01:30 We reach the kids house, and the band was getting set up. There were quite the amount of parents and children there, but it was not sketchy at all. We start to mingle with our friends until we notice the trampoline. There were a bunch of junior high- schoolers playing on it, but we didnt care, and neither did they. C and I jump on and bounce around a little bit, but my feet got cold so I hopped off. As I was putting my shoes back on the band started to warm up and tune their instruments. C and I walk towards the band and sit down in lawn chairs. The band was set up on this stone wall sort of thing, with different ledges on it for each member of the band.

The trees behind them had no leaves; and the naked branches and stone walls went together well visually, everything looked sort of medieval. I felt like it was centuries ago. I turn around and check out the rest of the backyard, there is a small horse farm with rolling hills of beautiful autumn trees flowing around. The horse looked like some sort of huge dog, and the shaggy dog that was running around reminded me of a small horse. I was tripping very hard, and they were some of the strangest visuals Ive had off only two grams of mushrooms. C started to feel VERY uneasy and sketched out because of all the parents. I kept trying to explain to him that they have no idea were tripping, but I cant get through to him.

T+01:50 I am starting to peak, I am tripping quite hard. Ts band starts to play the song American Idiot by Green Day. The line all across the alien nation interests me. Even though I know what the song is really about, I tell myself that theyre sort of describing what I am seeing; a strange, strange distorted alien world. C is sitting in his chair, still all freaked out by the parents, but not saying anything to make it noticeable. I head into the kids house because I have to use the bathroom. I had never been to his house and it was kind of weirding me out. All the Halloween decorations looked cool though. Skeletons, Ghouls, pumpkins, and spider webs filled the house. I look in the mirror and my pupils are as big as saucers. I completely forget to piss and start to head back outside and then I remember why I came inside. I start to laugh and then I use the bathroom. When I come out of the bathroom, C and a couple other friends were now also inside. C keeps telling me he has to leave because of the parents. I start to get very annoyed with this and tell him we will in a bit.

T+02:10 We head back outside and I am feeling very strange. My trip is still weird, Ive never had visuals like these. Not that they were too intense (Ive eaten 10 grams before), they were just weird as fuck. Suddenly, we see some girls we know and they come over to us. I tell them Im tripping and we talk a bit. My other very good friend M shows up too and was very jealous of our psychedelic state because he is also a dedicated psychonaut. 
/n

T+02:20 C asks again if we can leave, and since I was starting to also feel uncomfortable, we start to leave and walk down the road. C, M, and I head the opposite way (Not towards Cs house) but into the backwoods roads. Down the street we see some kids we know and walk down to them. Theyre all about a year or two younger than me and they found it funny that we were tripping sack. My friends, P and J are there and ask me if I have any MDMA. I told them I did not and P followed C, M, and I into the woods to smoke some bowls. We all walk down a path until we are about a half mile into the forest. A swamp surrounds the path so we didnt have much room, but worked with it. Everything in the forest was moving around and alive. I packed up my pipe with some Jerry Berry and we smoke a bowl or two. P matches my bowls with some brown seedy schwag that he got for free. Now, I never pass on a bowl tripping or not, but I didnt want the good taste of the Jerry Berries to be ruined by the dirt taste, and kindly denied a hit. P also says he doesnt even want to smoke it and M smoked it to his head. We stop smoking and head further on down the path until it comes out to the road

T+03:05 We reach the end of the path and are wishing we were somewhere else, instead of just walking around the boonies. At that moment, our friends T, B (Ts girlfriend), and S drive up to us in their car. I couldnt have been happier to seem them, and we all piled into the car and start to head towards Ss house. I am still tripping quite hard and I stick my head out of the window, the cold autumn air feels wonderful on my face, and the pastures and woodlands that we drive by look amazing.
/n
/n
T+03:30 We reach Ss house and by that time its dark out. I take a piss in the woods near his driveway and the piles of leaves are breathing and swaying. They reminded me of those leaf piles army guys lay under because they were moving around as if they were alive.
/n
/n
T+03:35 We head inside, chill for a bit, eat some Halloween candy, smoke some bowls and watch Pink Floyds The Wall. The movie is very enjoyable and adds some nice visuals to the trip. S has a lot of neon fuzzy wall hangers in his room full of mushrooms and pot leaves. They look awesome in the dark.
/n
/n
T+04:05 Part way into the movie I leave the room and head into Ss upstairs bathroom. It is an older house and the vine patterns on the wallpaper were moving around and very much alive. I closed my eyes and was getting some nice closed-eyed visuals, kind of reminding me of 60s psychedelic poster artwork. I finish up and head back into the room to finish the movie.
/n
/n
T+05:25 I am barely tripping hard anymore, but Im still quite altered. C also says he is pretty much down from his trip, but is definitely not yet back to baseline. We all decide to head over to my good friend Ds house.
/n
/n
T+05:40 We arrive at Ds house and I am not tripping anymore. I am very happy to be at his house, as its one of our main hangouts and I am very comfortable there.
/n
/n
T+05:50 We head out onto Ds back porch to smoke a couple bowls and some butts and end up having a sort of pine needle battle, scooping up handfuls and throwing them at each other. Then I head home, smoke a couple more bowls, and pass out watching the horror classic John Carpenters Halloween.

All in all, my strange Halloween trip smoothed out to a very enjoyable experience, and a defining moment in my long use of magical mushrooms. Happy tripping :)</bodytext></report>
