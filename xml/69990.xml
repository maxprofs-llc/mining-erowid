I started taking this drug for major insomnia.  My doctor prescribed it to me and I was a little apprehensive at first because of it's history of being a drug with strange side effects.  I've taken all of the drugs for insomnia including, Ambien 5mg and 10mg, Xanax up to 2mg @ bedtime, all of the OTC's, and this drug by far is the most effective.  Additionally it's one of the cheapest prescription sleep aids I've tried and I love it.  I highly recommend this drug to anyone with insomnia.</bodytext></report>
