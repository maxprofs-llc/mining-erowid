It was a very dull and boring saturday night. Me laying on my pillows in my room reading a book. When the phone rings. I answer. Its one my friends and hes waiting in the parking lot outside my house. I figured id be polite and go outside to see him. Even though I didint want to hang out with this particular friend at the time.

We sit in his truck listening to music. As he is smoking cigarettes and I refraining for the moment as I am trying to quit. Hours go by. Boredom starts to take its toll. I try and go back into my house but I called a bitch so I decide to stay......(peer pressure is real). We start talkin and somehow cocaine becomes the topic. And one thing leads to another and boom we have a gram of cocaine and me out alot of money. Two people quickly turns to three when cocaine comes around. We split the gram up and snort what we have. I feel great for about 40 minutes and then start to feel immensely guilty and also the feelings of a coke crash arent helping either.

I swore myself away from that white devil. But she found her way back somehow. The guilt is so immense Ie fallen into a deep depression....I still feeling depressed two days later.

They say relapse occurs on the way to recovery...I went 8 months cold turkey and then this happened....my thoughts are what lead to this.....I started telling myself that it be ok just for a little bit. But it wasnt.....even just for about a half hour
