I'd tried mushrooms before but in much lower doses. In fact I had done something extremely stupid on a mushroom trip before - gone to that movie 'The Ring'. I saw it when I was just high on chronic and it wasn't scary but on shrooms... scariest thing ever.

This time some of my friends and I had decided to get some mushrooms and go and watch a a fight. My friend was fighting this kid down at a school.

We got the shrooms and ate them then went back to my house. As soon as they kicked in, we left and started to make our way down to the fight. It was just before Christmas and everyone had their Christmas lights up.  We were so amazed by them and stopped at lots of houses just to stare.

At one house, we stopped and wre staring then noticed that the people had been standing in the drive way the entire time. We went down to 7-11 and I got a slurpee. By this time I was really messed up.

When we finally got down to the fight, the atmosphere was overwhelming.

There was about 100 people, it was night, it was in a forest beside the school, it was really foggy, and I could barely stand up.

The fight took forever to start. When it finally did, I watched a minute of it then asked my friend if I could use his cell phone because I thought I was going to die. I kept calling my house and it wouldn't work. I tried about 10 times and couldn't figure it out. I went up to some girls I know and asked them if they could call for me. They did and I asked my mom to come and get me (she knew I was doing mushrooms that night). It took FOREVER for her to get there. Without realising it, I had given the cell phone away to someone. My friend was pretty mad about that. I think he got it back but I'm not sure.

When my mom finally got there, I told her I was never going to do them again and I thought I was going to die.

Everyone we drove past looked like a cutout cardboard person. Everything was 2-D. When we got home, my mom gave me a mandarin orange and I just sat and stared at the computer screen. She asked me if I knew how to use it and I said 'What? The orange?' she said 'No the computer.' I started laughing and said I don't think so. Then I stared some more.

I went up to my room and listened to some Pink Floyd and Pantera. Then my friends (O ya I hadn't told anyone except the girls that had called my house for me that I was leaving. No one knew where I was) came over to my house. They thought I had died. I felt very sick for alot of the trip but had really good visuals. I did mushrooms again the next weekend but felt really sick and had a bad trip. I haven't done them since.</bodytext></report>
