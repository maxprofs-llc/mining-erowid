Well, I did it again. Kids, don't mix xanax and booze, although it is about a fun freaking buzz. I've tried it all, but there is something obliterating about benzo/ethanol cocktails. Like sugical anesthesia. Only it will also put you in jail quicker than shit, as you may do things under the alkiebenzo blackout influence you'd never ever do sober (like breaking into houses, vandalism, unwelcome comeons to the opposite sex.). I'm facing 2 years in prison for a temazepam/vodka dui crash that broke another dude's ribs, so be careful!!!</bodytext></report>
