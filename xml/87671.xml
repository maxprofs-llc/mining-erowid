I've had an opportunity to trial a interesting new compound over the last couple of weeks NBOMEe 2cc (25C NBOMe) or 2-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine or 2-4-chloro-25-dimethoxyphenyl-N-2-methoxyphenylmethylethanamine

Set and setting: At home. bored on a weekday.

First trial at 300umg sublingually, using the liquid measurement method at 100ugm,s per drop. Three drops were applied to a paper towel and were held under the tongue for 15mins. A slight numbing is noticed but this could a result of the alcohol the substance was dissolved in.
/n
/n
30mins nothing really noticed at this point
/n
45min slight stomach discomfort noted
/n
60min starting to notice some color brightening and a slight energy push...
/n
75min coming up now. Color intensification increasing, a mild euphoria noted 
/n
90 min Nice...effects are very manageable. visuals are like 2C-C visuals but, with a nice body high and slight energy push. No real negative body issues noted.
/n
90min -160min went for nice long walk around the neighborhood.The body feels good and mentally feeling quite in control even though I'm tripping at low +++
/n
300min I notice the energy push is waning a little. visuals still going ++ to +++
/n
300min - 360min body high slowly decreasing and visuals have decreased to ++
/n
480 mins back to baseline total duration is about 8 to 9 hours
/n
/n
Second trial 400ugm sublingually
/n
Same effects as above are noted: euphoria and energy were increased somewhat. Visuals were still close to the same level low +++ level. Very 2C-C-like in nature.
/n
400ugms seems to be a good working dosage. Be careful going higher with this one though. I've heard reports of increasing negative effects going past 1mg.
/n
Better be safe then sorry....;-)

/n
All in all a very worthwhile and novel new compound. Its not a very introspective chemical, but more of a rave or party drug. Not in your face like MDMA but a special chemical in it own right.
