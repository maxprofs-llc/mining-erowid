There are some places you wish you never visit ever.  About 20 hits of 5-MeO-DMT snorted is one of those places.  I have never snorted this before, so I thought now would be a good time.  I smoked it before, about 200 or 250mg, but it was over the course of 3 hours.  With a five to ten minute high, it's controllable.

I snorted about 25mg.  It still was barely hitting me.  I know it requires more if you snort to get high, so I took 50mg more.  It just starts hitting me, and I take another 25mg about.  Then it started hitting me hard.  Probably too hard.  I was pacing my room in this frantic 'OUT OF MY MIND' dance.  Then, it was too much.  It was way too much.  I knocked on my neighbor's door in my dorm suite.

'What?  You want us to turn down the music?' he said.

I was like, 'No, no, I....  took too many....  too much shit....  I'm just having a bad trip.  Is it okay if I just hang out in here and calm down?  I just want to calm down.'

He was a nice guy and he let me hang out.  He was interested in knowing what I was feeling like.  He didn't quite understand that I wanted to be completely sober at that moment.  I told him I had intense dissociation and intense visuals.  He told me to go throw up, and I went to the bathroom and tried to puke.  It wouldn't matter, though, since I snorted it, but they didn't know that.  I thought that puking might cause the nostrils to shoot it out, since sometimes puke goes through your nose.  I puked, and it wasn't much.  I puked a little bit again.  Instead of feeling relieved, I only felt more sick.  I stood up, and another friend said, 'You don't look so good....  dude, you were puking blood.'  I washed my hands in the sink.  He said, 'Don't worry, it's only water.'  I was very scared, extremely dissociated.  They alerted the Resident Assistants who called the cops.  They also brought me back to my room.

The RA said, 'Dude, just tell me what you took,' and I told him.  The paramedics came with a stretcher and took my blood pressure.  It was 300 to 340, 'Twice or three times what it normally should be.'  I was sweating intensely, and the hallucinations became overly intense, as I lost familiarity with everything that I once knew.  I also lost all color and became extremely pale.  The paramedics were ready to take me to the hospital, but I had to sign a waiver because I just wanted to stay in my room.  The thought that I could die from this was pacing through my mind, but with the cops and paramedics there, I felt a bit more secure.  I just wanted to be in my room and stay in a familiar place.

I finally came down, and the cops left.  After that, I hung out with some friends to just try and mellow out...  But, what I went through was probably the worst hell of my life ever.  When I overdosed on Coricidin pills (just 8 of them), it was horrible, but this was at least 10 times worse than that.  I felt so, so, so sick.  I was afraid of death just reaching up and grabbing me...  But, I'm alive.  This psychonaut lives another.  As for that, I wish you all the best of tripping, and particularly the safest of all tripping.</bodytext></report>
