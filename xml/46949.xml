After my first 5 MDMA experiences something was lost, the magic was gone. I found out about the use of 5htp as a buffer for MDMA comedowns. I also read a single report about a user taking a colossal amount of 5htp prior to dosing and discovered that more serotonin in my brain was more important than the amount of MDMA ingested.

I tried taking 1 gram (20 50 mg capsules) prior to dosing. I took 1 every 15-30 mins from the morning up to 3 hrs before dosing. I found that not only was the magic fully regained it was 10x better then before. Comedowns and after effects were lessened massively as well. I found with this regime of taking 5htp I could take MDMA 2 days in a row for example with no noticeable tolerance.

Throughout my whole lifetime of taking MDMA (50 or so times) I carried on with this regime of 1 gram of 5htp before dosing and found I developed absolutely no tolerance to its effects. The 'magic' was always there.

I had heard of Stablon (tianeptine) and was interested in its effects in combination with MDMA. I found that the use of Stablon with MDMA would prolong MDMA's effects for an additional 2 hours and lessen the comedown.</bodytext></report>
