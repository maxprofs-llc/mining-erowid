I have been addicted to opiate painkillers for the past year.  It is controlling my life.  I was on the Suboxone program.  For those who are unfamiliar with this program, it's supposed to be a maintenance medication to taper through opiate withdrawals.  It completely takes away withdrawals, but it's a part opiate itself, so I became addicted to that. Enough was enough, I was ready to quit for good.  Today is my 5th day clean.

Yesterday, I was feeling suicidal from the excruciating anxiety that comes from opiate withdrawal.  I then talked to my aunt, who had been addicted to alcohol and morphine and quite them at the same time, she has now been clean 3 years.  But I talked to her for a while and she gave me some Neurontin, she though it would help.  Well she was right, it completely calmed my nerves and took away nearly all of the anxiety.

It's working well so far, and considering it last so long it works so well.  I was able to actually get 5 solid hours of sleep, and I could've slept more but I had to wake up.  Anyone who has experience opiate withdrawals knows that sleep is hard to come by, and we take it for granted when we don't have an addiction to take care of.</bodytext></report>
