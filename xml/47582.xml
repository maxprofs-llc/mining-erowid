I took Hydrocodone 10/325 APAP Norco for 18 months.  I took an average of 4 pills at once, on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The other 3 days I did not take any period.  Total weekly consumption was between 12-20 pills.  Then one day I awoke with hearing loss in my left ear accompanied by ringing (tinnitus).  It lasted for 2 days.  I went to my doctor who examined me and said my ear looked good and that it was probably allergies or infection.  So I thought the hydrocodone was innocent.  Then after 12 days off, I took two hydro's at 8pm and another two at 11pm. All was well until the next morning when I woke up with hearing loss and ringing again.</bodytext></report>
