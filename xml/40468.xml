I just wanted to write and tell my experience of getting off of 1-4 Butanediol.  Since 1999 I was doing GBL or 1-4BD pretty much every 1.5 hours!  A fact I'm not proud of.

I didn't even get high on it anymore.  I just did it to 'maintain'.

I was like an over-eater and the fridge.  Every 1.5 hours I'd just find myself in the kitchen at the sink where I kept it.  For the last 2 years I even needed it to sleep.  The max. amount of sleep I could get was 3 hours before waking up to do another.

My Christmas gift to myself and my family was checking into a medical detox in December/2004.  Now I've withdrawled from this stuff before it was NOT pleasent.  However-- in detox the doctor loaded me up with phenobarbital.  Passed out for a good 15 hours or so and it was done.  I was litterally feeling much better by day 2 and barely experienced (or felt) any withdrawl symptoms!  I was actually hoping for a bad experience to teach me a lesson :-)

If you're addicted to this crap I highly recomend the above.

PS- I should note that before checking into detox I was systematically watering down my doses.  At first I watered it about 10% and over about a month worked my way up to 50%.  More to play tricks with my mind so in a way I felt I was still getting a 2.5mL dose but in reality only getting 1.25mL.

After 2 months of being off of it... a 2.5mL dose still doesn't do much for me and it's going to take a couple more months until my sleep patterns return to normal.

I hope this helps,
