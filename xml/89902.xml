About 5 months ago I was turned onto the synthetic cannabinoid by a friend who had some experience in smoking it. After hearing all about its great high, legal availability, and invisibility to drug tests, I naturally was very curious about it. After doing my homework on it, I finally said what the hell and ordered 2 grams of the fine, pale powder. If Id only known what I was really getting into

Preparation:
/n
Preparation was very simple. About  120mg of the powder was weighed out on a scale. The dose of powder was then mixed into 1 cup of cooking oil (heating the oil makes it much more soluble). After the JWH was completely dissolved into the oil, the brownies were then made just like I would make regular brownies. It should be noted that I used the JWH exclusively in brownies. Never once did I smoke any of the chemical, although perhaps things would have turned out differently if I had

The first experience:
/n
During my very first use of the drug, I was in the company of two of my friends (each approx. my same body weight) who had not experienced the drug but agreed to try it with me. Each of us took approximately 2/3 of a whole brownie, as we were being cautious and didnt want too much or too little. I had read that too high a dose of the drug would lead to an extremely paranoid or even scary high. Then we waited. I knew that it would take some time for the effects to set in, so we patiently watched tv on the couch waiting for it to hit. 30 minutes later, nothing. 45 minutes later, nothing. One of my friends stated that it wasnt going to work and left to go home to his place. I was beginning to have my own doubt too, but still waited patiently with my remaining friend.  Just a few minutes later however, things began to change. At first, I felt a slight body high, as if I was slowly accelerating on the couch. I mentioned it to my partner and he agreed that he was starting to feel similar sensations too. My phone buzzed and I received a text from my friend who had left. It read something along the lines of HOLY SHIT THIS IS NUTS. The feeling quickly built and before we knew it, we were more baked than we had ever been before.

It was quite like the feeling of cannabis, except with an strong intensity unlike anything I had felt with cannabis before. It seemed to sort of unlock my imagination, and for hours I simply vegd out on the couch, lost in my own mind. I became moderately hungry, but not as bad as the munchies I would get with cannabis. Time seemed to move incredibly slow and my imagination ran wild. While it had been one of the greatest highs Id had at that point, there was however a noticeable underlying paranoia to it, and I remember becoming quite afraid of a dark doorway at one point. My friend who had left apparently had a much worse night than I, as during the night he sent me a text explaining how inexplicably terrified he was (in the future he simply ate a smaller size brownie to make his high better). The high lasted throughout the night until I fell asleep. The next morning I woke up feeling kinda bad, turns out JWH will sometimes leave me with a sort of chemical hangover. Nonetheless, I was overjoyed that it had worked so good.

Drifting to the dark side:
/n
After the great success of the first experience, I was overjoyed at what I had found. An undetectable drug that had long lasting effects and an incredible high that left me almost fully functional, it was almost too good to be true. The high would take approximately 45-60 minutes to arrive (although it would sometimes be sooner when the brownies were hot and fresh), and would go strong for up to 8-10 hours. While I was on it, I never had any problems driving or sleeping or with anything really. As a matter of fact, driving was so much fun while on the JWH that it became an activity of choice, and drug-induced roadtrips became regular occurrences. /n Over the course of the next few weeks, my friends and I made and consumed more brownies, increasing our uses to almost daily and our doses to whole brownies. The initial batch lasted us about a week and a half, and then we made more. This time however, we upd the dosage to about 250mg for the batch. 
/n
/n
As weeks passed the highs only got better and we kept increasing the dosage bit by bit with every batch. In the back of my mind, I knew that I was building a dependency but it was too good of a thing for me to give it up or even slow down. I began to notice that it affected my memory, much like the way of alcohol. Our high times became ever more blurred and distorted and I would sometimes experience large lapses in memory. My appetite decreased dramatically too. Three meals a day turned into two and then one. I would feel torturously hungry, but it was as if my body would not let me eat.  My appetite returned to normal however while I was high and only then. It soon became clear to me that I could not continue like this, but I would feel so shitty when I wasnt high that it was almost unbearable to be sober. I ordered more of the chemical as our initial supply began to dwindle. 
/n

Perhaps the worst side-effect of the drug however affected my work out schedule. I became inexplicably extremely nervous and nauseous before every work out, and it got to the point where I couldnt get in a good PT without throwing up at least once beforehand. Horrifyingly, this side effect seems to be somewhat permanent. I have not taken the drug in approximately 2 months, and I still get extremely nauseous before every workout. Ive made it to ONE pt session this month without throwing up first. It seems I may have done irreparable damage to my stomach as a result of such heavy use.

Getting off:
/n
Around the end of November I decided I had to stop for good and tried several times, but simply couldnt bring myself to truly kick it. I even tried simply cutting back to only a few uses a week, but that attempt was short-lived. Every minute I wasnt high on JWH was a fight. When I wasnt high I felt nauseous, tired, aggravated, depressed, and generally real shitty. I had built such a dependency that by the time I finally quite, the brownies were being made with at least 600mg per batch. It was simply out of control. 
/n
/n
Whether it was luck or divine intervention, the decision to go cold turkey was made for me. After a particularly high night, I awoke the next day unable to find the stash of JWH. It was simply gone. I could recall almost nothing of the night before, thanks to the JWH. Knowing I had to quit, I decided that now was as good a time as ever. I just wish I had been prepared for the withdrawal. I knew it wasnt going to be easy, but it turned out harder than I could have thought. My appetite disappeared all together. I rarely finished a meal and I had to force feed myself to keep my strength. Any meal bigger than small snack size was thrown up. I was horribly nauseous 24/7. I was more irritable than ever and was tired all the time but had trouble sleeping. I threw up at least once a day and always before any work-outs. I felt more shitty and sick than I remember ever feeling before. These symptoms stayed with me for about a week before they subsided, with the exception of pre-pt nausea, from which I still suffer.

Synopsis:
/n
JWH-018 is a drug that can be incredibly great or incredibly terrible. As long as you keep it in moderation, you will be fine. My experience may seem bad, but understand that I was taking daily doses of brownies made with way more JWH than one should ever put in them. Keep the doses low and youll be alright. I would even recommend JWH-018 as a good alternative for weed, for those who have jobs with drug tests or just want something new. However, remember moderation is key!</bodytext></report>
