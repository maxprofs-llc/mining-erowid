I had been researching for some time, browsing and searching for all different sorts of experiences, when I came across Salvia Divinorum reports.  I read almost everyone and finally decided I had to try it, so I invited my good friend Quince up to my college and ordered 1/2 gram of 10x.  It arrived a couple weeks later, and I called quince to have him come.

We couldn't smoke it in the dorms, and we didn't have a sitter; so we ended up driving out into the country and parking in some field near a line of trees and underneath a full moon.  I loaded the 1/8 gram of Salvia into the bowl and let my friend take the first hit.  His eyes bugged out mid-inhalation, and I could tell he was already feeling it.  He was asking where he was, saying, 'I'm in the car? I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.'

I loaded up the another 1/8 and smoked it, immediately being propelled into a very trance-like, deep-humming reality, where things flowed by me in amazing grace.  Movement was not needed here, everything moved and manipulated as I desired it.  (First off, this didn't happen, I was moving, but it seemed as though I were still and everything moved around me.  I had found the center of the universe.)

We started to feel trapped in the vehicle we were sitting in, so we got out to walk, and immediately realized we had more to do. (another 1/8 gram each)(The amt. We took is apparently a high dose, be VERY careful, its very powerful).

We went back to the car after only about 15 feet and smoked the rest.

I was launched into another world...of psychedelic spinning colors and patterns.  Clowns, cars, lights, laughter and walls.  I felt as though I had been enveloped in a circus of realities, all spinning out of control, tumbling over one another.  The doors on the car seemed to lead to other realities, and I didnt know who I was, believing my friend to be the friend of another man whose life I was now living.  I recognized this friend of this new man I was as 'Randy'; if that makes sense.  As if I was living someone elses life.  Randy (my friend) was trying to show me through his door, another reality, trying to lead me back to where I used to live.   I turned around and opened my door and looked up and down, the world, the trees and fields and car all disappeared and I was left staring at a myriad of alternatives to every moment.  As if, for every second I lived, the possibilites of reactions and actions I could have were endless, and I was able to jump around inbetween them; watching a 100,000 me's above and below, each acting out every possibility.

I was seeing all the levels on which God plays, the complete understanding of the infinite, fractally patterned with colors unknown to man. This terrified me, and I shut the door quickly, turning to see my friend again, who wasn't even the supposed Randy anymore, but was a being of this new universe.

At this point, I lost it, I couldnt understand what was happening, like I had died, was now in the infinite, playing among God's heights.  It was wonderfully terrifying, but I have no way of describing it accurately.</bodytext></report>
