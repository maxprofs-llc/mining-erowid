Intro
/n
-----------
/n
This is a true story about my second trip on Dimenhydrinate.  My first trip I took eleven Dramamine pills (550 mg Dimenhydrinate), and I experienced a few fascinating visual hallucinations, and it was quite enjoyable.  The trip that I am about to describe, was far from pleasant.  I however, do not regret this trip, it was a powerful experience that I will never forget.

Eighteen Pills
/n
-----------
/n
It was the weekend, and I was visiting a friend who lives on campus where I used to attend school.  I really wanted to try a larger dose of Dimenhydrinate to further investigate its effects.  I was in my friend's dorm room, who agreed to sit for me when I downed eighteen pills, for a total of 900 mg.  I waited...

The First Effects: Body High (heavy legs, mirror tricks, and easily startled.
/n
-----------
/n
About twenty minutes go by, and I remember telling my sitter that I think I could start to feel the body high, I stood up from my chair and I immediately could tell that I was defiantly feeling something.  My legs felt clumsy and heavy, and my upper body felt light, I also remember it feeling dreamlike.  Remembering how fascinating it was to look at my own reflection with my first experience on Dramamine, I decided to turn out the lights and approach the mirror.  I put my face only a few inches from the mirror staring deeply into my own eyes (even without drugs, the face seems to undergo minor subtle changes).  After about 10 seconds of staring into the mirror, watching my reflection twitch or blink at me... my friend/sitter's roommate unlocks the door from outside, *CLICK*, which is about two feet directly to the left of me.  I was shocked by this sudden noise, and I jumped and an awkward noise escaped my mouth.  As he started to open the door and walk in, I flipped the lights on and said aloud, You startled me. He was probably embarrassed as I, and I can only imagine what was going through his mind when he walked in to see me with a stupid look on my face standing in the dark right by the door.  We don't really communicate with him, my friend and I are considered geeks, and his room mate is considered gangsta.

Something moved? A mouse?
/n
-----------

My friend was showing me some music on his laptop, while his room mate was digging in his closet for something, and then I thought I saw something move behind his laptop, I quickly glanced and noticed that nothing was there.  And then shortly after that, I saw something again move and when I glanced, I saw a mouse just sitting there for about a second, and then it vanished.  We decided to leave the room, since his room mate made it clear that he was staying in there, so we decided to go on a walk.  I opened my suitcase to grab my coat, and as I was grabbing my coat, the same mouse as I saw earlier, stumbled out of my coat and fell inside the bag, I was startled by this, and then I realized that it was just a rolled-up pair of socks.  I grabbed my coat, and we left.  We started walking down a flight of stairs, and I found this to be more difficult than I thought it would be, I felt very clumsy, and the dream-like state seemed to enhance.

More visuals  (The transparent walker)
/n
-----------
/n
It was probably about 11:00 pm at night, so it was fairly dark.  There were a few people outside walking around (it is a college campus after all, and it was thirsty-thursday I guess it's the night to get shitfaced?)  I kept seeing movement out of the corner of my eye as I was walking, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary, until I saw this strange entity.  It seemed like something that resembles a ghost.  It was a transparent human, no color, not even black and white.  The air just seemed to ripple around this very distinct human shape who was walking.  And each foot-step seemed to leave a residue on the ground.  It was approaching us, but I wasn't scared as I knew this was one of my visuals.  I saw a car off in the distance, and I turned my focus on the mobile vehicle for a second, and then I glanced back to find that this strange transparent entity was no longer there.

Major Short-Term Memory Loss - Unfinished sentences
/n
-----------
/n
We continued walking, and I was trying to describe the transparent human that I perceived, and I found it very difficult to speak my mind.  I remember I kept throwing in Umm... And ahhh.  And then I started explaining to my friend that it it was very difficult to think of what I want to say, and then I remember asking him What was I talking about?  He reminded me that I was describing a hallucination that I saw.  So I started trying to describe it again, and I would forget what I was talking about midway through, and I remember I was getting really frustrated but amused at the same time that I couldn't even remember what I was talking about.  After several more attempts, I finally gave up.

A Powerful Auditory Hallucination  Metal Guitar Riffs
/n
-----------
/n
We continued walking, and I started to hear music, it sounded like a live heavy metal concert.  I remember the music sounded pleasing, and my friend is a major metal-head, and he didn't seem to respond to this music.  I asked him if he could hear the music, and he said that he could hear this loud constant sound, but not music.  As we got closer, sure enough there was no live metal concert, it was just some kind of loud vent attached to the outside of a building, but I could still hear the music playing.

What Are You Talking About? Oh You're on the phone.
/n
-----------
/n
As we were walking, my friend's phone rang and he answered it and was talking on the phone.  I kept forgetting he was on the phone, and I remember asking him several times what he was talking about, and then I kept realizing he was on the phone, and then I would forget again.  It seemed like my brain would just forget things constantly.

Another Visual - The Lottery scratch off card
/n
-----------
/n
We kept walking towards our destination, we were about half-way there when I saw what looked like a lottery scratch off card laying on the ground.  It didn't occur to me at first that this might be a hallucination, when I bent over to pick it up, I felt the the texture of the damp concrete sidewalk, but I could still see the card there.  The appearance of the card seemed to flicker a bit, like the text or shapes on it seemed to shift around a bit, and then I bent down to examine it closer, and I realized that nothing was there.  It was just an oil spill with rainbowish colors on the ground.  I was very amazed at how the visual took a while for it to vanish, how it persisted to stay there even when I tried grasping it.  I think this was because my mind had no reason to doubt this lottery ticket on the ground.

Slipped into a dream
/n
-----------
/n
We decided to stop at Jimmy Johns for a sandwich before reaching Kwik Trip, and when we went inside, the place was packed full of people, and it was really loud.  I could smell the alcohol on everyone of them, they were all drunk and very annoying.  I wasn't hungry, so I was just waiting for my friend to order his food.  I was just leaning up against the glass wall for support, and as I was waiting. 
/n
--We left the Jimmy Johns and we started walking outside with my sitter, going towards the Kwik Trip and I remember we were talking about something as we were walking.--
/n
I then found myself standing in Jimmy Johns, leaning up against that same glass window.  I realized that we had not actually left yet, and my brain just played out that scenario in my head.  After realizing this, I was somewhat scared at how realistic it was.  Finally my friend got his food, and we started walking to Kwik Trip.
/n

Something went terribly wrong...
/n
-----------
/n
I don't even remember actually finally getting to Kwik Trip, and a large duration of the walk back.  We were almost back to the dorms.  I do remember that we were almost back to the dorms, when my sitter slipped on some ice and fell very hard on the ground.  I don't remember seeing him actually fall, but he was laying on the ground making a long low moaning sound.  He got the wind knocked out of him.  I remember standing over him asking him if he was okay, and what happened.  I was extremely confused by this.  He didn't answer, he was just laying there moaning.  A car stopped and shouted out the window, asking if he was okay.  I fumbled with my words really bad, I don't remember what I told him but I remember the man was very confused by what I said and he asked me again if he was alright.  I said something about him falling and got the wind knocked out of him.  He drove off and I just stood there, not sure what I should do.  My friend wouldn't answer me, he just kept moaning, and he sounded like he was in a lot of pain.  
/n
/n
An old man saw my friend laying on the ground, and he asked if he was okay.  My friend said something about not being able to breathe, and that he was in severe pain.  I told the man that he slipped on some ice.  I waited there with the old man until my friend caught his breath.  The man asked if we wanted a ride home, and my friend said yes.  He said that he was going to come back with his truck, and then he walked off.  When he came back, we got in his truck and he drove us back to the dorms.  I remember talking to the old man on the way back, and I remember that the conversation was about computer security (I am a major computer security enthusiast), and then I realized how strange of me it was to talk about computers at a time like this.

Alone

When we got back to the dorms, my friend was still moaning and in much pain.  He was scared that he might have internal bleading, and he said that it was the worst pain he had ever felt.  He got his other friend to drive him to the hospital.  I was asked if I wanted to go with, and I said no.
/n
/n
I do remember that I was in the lounge for a while, pacing back and forth staring at my feet as I was walking.  I had a few minor visual hallucinations (such as flys buzzing around, that later disappeared), and I remember I was extremely confused and worried about what happened.  I started to wonder if I was just in a dream right now, and I started to lose hope for regaining my sanity.
/n
/n
For some reason, I don't know how to really explain this, but I was worried that I might have internal bleeding... I knew that I wasn't the one who slipped on ice, but for whatever reason I was concerned about myself.  Why?
/n
/n
Later I receive a call from my friend who fell, and he asked if I could pick him up from the hospital.  The effects pretty much worn off, I had some trouble focusing my eyes, but I was no longer tripping.  I picked him up from the hospital, and it turns out that they just gave him Tylenol or Advil of some sort and they told him that he should be fine, and that he didn't break any bones.  He was pissed about this, because he said it was extremely painful and they didn't even do anything to help him.
/n
/n
I asked him about what all happened, and he did confirm that he did slip on the ice and that old man with the truck gave us a ride back to the dorms.  He also told me that the whole ride back I was silent and I didn't say a single word.</bodytext></report>
