Have you ever felt like the walls were breathing while looking at them? Have you ever felt you could look at the T.V. as if you were looking through a window into a new world? I have, after I smoked Salvia for the second time. It left me emotionally disturbed, and a feeling as if I have a speech impediment. I can think the words but they come out wrong. The first time I did salvia I'll admit, it was the best thing that could ever happen to me. I had a wonderful time, though I walked around when I shouldn't have. I have had these persistent visual disturbances for just about 2-3 weeks. I've had bad memory but that could also be due to marijuana because I smoked it habitually.</bodytext></report>
