I started taking Valerian root about 3 months ago for insomnia. I don't like the idea of taking OTC sleep pills all the time for obvious reasons.  I have always had problems falling and staying asleep, along with lots of anxiety, and some ADD type problems.  Since I started taking the Valerian root I have not only been able to fall asleep, I have been able to go back to sleep if for some reason I wake up.  I have also noticed an better feeling overall,more energy, and less anxiety.  I have also taken valerian for mild muscle pain.

I have not noticed any withdrawl effects from Valerian root.  I would definately recomend others to try it out for its medicinal effects.</bodytext></report>
