Wine was made with 20 gr of Nympaea alba in a litre of white wine with two big spoons of honey. The drink was kept for two weeks. Then I removed the herbage from the drink. It's color was bright red with a taste that reminded me of apples.

The whole drink was 3 glasses. I finished it in about 40 minutes. The first glass went down easily and its taste was pleasant but strong. After the first glass at about 20 minutes I started getting a bit dizzy.

+20 My hands started shaking a little. I feel them very light. It's difficult to control them. A change of perception was noticed and everything felt soft.

+30 I am starting to relax. I already drank the second glass and I feel waves of nausea.

+40 With difficulty I drank the last glass because from the taste I felt like vomiting. My movement is normal and I can control it. Nausea has passed and now I feel calm and happy.

I felt lethargic and I went to sleep. From the time I slept the first auditory hallucinations appeared. They were short and from some of them I woke up. The first one that I remember was something like someone was knocking on my door and then fell down to the ground. The second was similar to whispers.</bodytext></report>
