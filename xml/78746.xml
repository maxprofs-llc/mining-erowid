+Alcohol: if taken 800mg before or during alcohol consumption seems to change character of intoxication a little bit (feeling more 'sober', seems to reduce influence of alcohol on movement) plus reduce hangover dramatically for me.
/n
/n
+Amphetamine/methamphetamine: seems to induce amphetamine central effects, but make me kind of 'very serious about everything'. Reduce some of the hangover effects (numbness, lack of motivation) if taken next day.
/n
/n
+MDMA (Ecstasy): increase central effects (even in an experienced user) if taken 2400-3600mg during the day before the experience, but can make it too intense if I want to redose. Make day after a little bit easy.
/n
/n
+DOM/DOB: intensify and prolong experience if taken after the peak, quite unpleasant for me.
/n
/n
+Methylone: central effects increased dramatically, my standard dose of methylone is 180-200mg, but if I take 2400mg of piracetam during the day before the experience 120-140 seems to be just fine.</bodytext></report>
