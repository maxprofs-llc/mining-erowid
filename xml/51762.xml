New Year's eve, 1999.  We had gathered with some friends to celebrate the coming millennium.  A chemist friend generously provided us all with an opportunity to sample

4-HO-MiPT, which he indicated was one of his favorite compounds.  After approximately 20 minutes an alert was noted, which quickly developed into an openness of heart and mind that was very warm and pleasant.

The mind remained lucid and conversation flowed easily.  We discussed scientific evidence of the existence of psychokinetic effects of thought influencing a change in sequence in a random number generator.  Focusing attention on the inner dimension, I observed the calm lucidity of psilocybin that I typically enjoy toward the end of a psilocybin experience, as well as the warmth of heart that I generally experience from mescaline.  In all, a very pleasant way to bring in the new millenium and a fascinating material.  I look forward to further exploration of this one in solo to map the antipodes of the experience.</bodytext></report>
