Last year I purchased Intelectol (active ingredient Vinpocetine) from Spain as I thought it may assist with study and exam performance.  However, every time I ingest vinpocetine I experience heart palpitations (accerated heart beat) and feel slightly light headed.  Even on extremely small doses, such as 1mg, I persistently experience these undesirable side effects.  If you experience similar effects when using vinpocetine please upload your experience.</bodytext></report>
