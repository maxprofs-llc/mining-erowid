A friend of mine gave me three pills that he said were muscle relaxers. I asked him if they were like somas, and he's like 'yeah, but better.' Since I've taken a soma and a few shots of alcohol before, I decided to try the same thing with skelaxins. I've always loved somas and alcohol much better than just being drunk. Me and two friends of mine sat in my room, took three shots and one 800mg skelaxin tablet each. Very very soon we were feeling the pill. We were all sitting down on my couch watching Donnie Darko. We all felt really really drunk, but we weren't as out of our heads as we usually are when we're drunk. I think it's because we felt the physical effects of being really drunk, but we had only taken a few shots, so our minds weren't as messed up. We each took one or two more shots and then just sat around.

We laughed a lot at things, and walking around was a lot of fun. You aren't in control of your body at all and feel like you're floating and being pulled towards the ground at the same time. It's a very strange feeling, but a very fun one too. I recommend it over somas, although it's pretty similar. I later found out that though that skelaxins are also anti-anxiety pills, so that could have been a reason we all liked them better than somas. The only problem I really had with them is that we went to sleep pretty soon after taking them, and a few hours later when we woke up we were extremely hung over, and I almost never get hung over. Now, we had started at 10:30 in the morning, which is by a long shot the earliest I've ever started drinking, so that might be the reason (we woke up at around 5:00 in the afternoon and felt like shit the rest of the day) but it could have also been due to the pill.</bodytext></report>
