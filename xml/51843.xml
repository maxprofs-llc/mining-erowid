I recently purchased a rather large Coleus Blumei ('Wild Lime' hybrid).  After reading several antecdotes on the supposed effects of this plant I dried 8 large leaves in the oven at 140 degrees for 45 minutes and than rolled and smoked a rather large 'spliff'.

Immediately I felt a mild relaxation that I, as a skeptic, simply took for a placebo effect.  Ten minutes later I began to feel a tingling sensation throughout my entire body, and began to question my initial skepticism.  At this time I felt as if I was melting into the couch, and definitely did not want to get up, but when I did so I realized a slight distortion/brightening of colors, waviness and a marked inebriation.

The total experience lasted approxamitely 4 hours and was very enjoyable.</bodytext></report>
