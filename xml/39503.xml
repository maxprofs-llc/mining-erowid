I have nearly 2 years experience with Foxy, tripping a countless number of times with this wonderful substance in every imaginable setting.

Up until the last month, my Foxy doses ranged from between 20-30mg, which according to most reports, is a pretty hefty dosage. After doing some more research and taking a plunge, I decided to experience what only a few brave/stupid souls have: taking 150+mg of Foxy at once. I had only seen a couple of people who had dared take this amount and the information they provided was very lacking. Anyway.

The most noticeable differences between a normal dose and one in this range are insane visuals, and a complete loss of the annoying body load. For me, the only load I have at this level is an INCREDIBLE body buzz, far surpassing that of MDMA. The visuals at this stage can't really be describe, but I will try my best. Also, lying in a totally darkened roomed will send me on a mind trip like I've never experienced before.

Now. for a brief experience from this past New Year's Eve. As for the setting, from 9-12:30 I was with 3 close friends and afterwards was at a larger party until I returned home at 5:00AM.

I ingested 200mg of 5-MeO-DiPT, dissolved in Ethanol for measurement at 9:30PM. For the first 30 minutes I became extremely nauseous, which I had not experienced at lower doses for quite some time. At the time I had been taking my daily dose of Xanax, but it does not seem to affect the trip at all; however, I have found that Paxil does seem to greatly lessen the entire Foxy experience.

At around 10pm I began to feel the familiar tryptimine-buzz and couldn't wait to begin my experience, especially since the nausea had passed.

10:30PM is when it hit me like a brick wall: I was quickly on my way to a +3.

11:00PM-05:00AM: The peak of the trip (which definitely lasts longer at this dosage). As I mentioned early, the entire experience can't be placed in words... the things I see and hear can't conform with everyday analogies. I've always had visuals with Foxy, but what was happening around me was at a level never before experienced. Curtains were furiously blowing as if a window had been left open. Ceiling fans and light fixtures rotated and descended (they were off of course).

The tracers were to he point where I could see multiple copies of a hand waved in front of my face for seconds (reminded me of a high dose of DXM) and in fact, everything around me that appeared to be moving also had a set of tracers. Never before have a I seen a stationary couch (or wall of that matter) move around my field of vision. At one point I was lost for nearly 30 minutes watching patterned wallpaper with images moving as if they were on television.

Now the only aspect of Foxy I don't absolutely love... the auditory hallucinations. All voices and music slowed down and dropped quite a few octaves. Listening to my stereo was almost not enjoyable. Songs were slow enough where every beat of every instrument could be individually discerned, which made almost all music take on an almost atonal quality. The only artist I could stand listening to was, strangely enough, Hallucinogen.

The trip would have lasted a few more hours (this is about the 5 time I've taken this dosage), but at 5:00AM I took several Klonopin and Ativan to help me come down and fall asleep. For the next hour or two I was in some sort of surreal half awake/half dreaming state that slowly melted away into a deep sleep.</bodytext></report>
