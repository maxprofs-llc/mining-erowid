I just smoked 2 or 3 bowls of catnip. I don't remember. It's not an intense high, but I am pretty relaxed. Yeah, now that I think about it, I'm positive it was 3. I didn't think it would work because usually it takes me a lot of weed to get high and this was catnip. I was bored and that was the only thing laying around. I kinda found it by accident while I was looking for other stuff. Usually I'm more of a hard drug user, but I had no way of getting anything then, so I was like what the hell, I'll try it. I mean I'm glad I did, but I'd rather take pills or something. The first hit kinda burns and tastes minty, but it's easier to hold in than weed is. I didn't cough at all. I just sat here with my head down on the table for probably about 10 minutes and it was just so peaceful and relaxing. I wasn't even thinking about anything else or even cared to think about anything else. Now my mouth tastes kinda like if I smoked a cigarette. I don't like the taste because I don't smoke, but it's worth it in the end I guess. If you're looking for an intense high, you won't get it, but it does help you relax a little bit.</bodytext></report>
