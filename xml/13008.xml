I sat down and finally smoked two cigarettes of calea mixed with a 'Third-Eye' blend (for relaxation), and had some decent results.  I had very vivid and long dreams, and they were quite strange.

I smoked them with my wife, one about 1.5 hours before we went to bed, and the other about a half hour before.  I felt very relaxed before hand, and the images were quite abundant when I closed my eyes.

I definitely prefer smoking dream herb instead of drinking the tea, which is down right disgusting even when mixed with camomille, california poppy, and honey.</bodytext></report>
