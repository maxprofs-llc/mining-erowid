Yesterday evening I decided to try my first attempt. I sat on my back lawn with a pipe and torch lighter. Took one, deep hit, held it for 30 seconds, did the second hit and BAM!!! I was in deep trouble. Every time my heart beat, it was like every muscle in my body was getting electoshock. I could see my limbs jerking. My head 'felt' like it looked like a half deflated, pushed in basketball. SOunds and thoughts just repeated over and over in my head like a skipping record. And I was SWEATING BULLETS. I could see my dogs watching me and they were getting agitated, which only reinforced in my mind that my body was somehow physically distorting and freaking them out. I started to panic and tried to get up and sort of just careened across the lawn (thank god I wasn't in the house) but did finally make it to a chair. About this time, the really violent effects were wearing off and I was just sweating and sort of dazed. Then--nothing. It was like, after this first, 30 second ass-kicking, there was nothing following. I then tried the chewing method for an hour or so, but still really felt no additional effects.

I was not pleased with the experience; ironically though, I feel really good today, better psychologically than I have in a long time (I suffer from depression and anxiety and have been on Paxil and Celexa over the last few years, but not currently). I will most likely continue to experiment, but with less powerful methods of smoking the 5X. That was just too intense and unpleasant. But I will most likely try to find a comfortable method/dosage.</bodytext></report>
