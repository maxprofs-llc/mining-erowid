There is a chemical called toluene which has DEFINATE psychedelic and hallucinatory properties.  Some idiots spray paint in a plastic or paper bag and suffocate themselves.  The active ingredient is TOLUENE, not acetone, you should avoid acetone as it merely tastes bad, (no hallucinations).  In order for me to achieve a trip I had to build a 'tolly-bong', basically you take a 20 oz. plastic bottle and you poke a hole near the top, put a straw through a hole.  Silicone the the gap around it and fill about 2' - 3' of either pure toluene, or Berrymans Octane Booster.  Whatever you use (NOT PAINT) it should evaporate with little residue and contain little if any acetone or acids and other bad shit.  I would hit the bottle letting fresh air in through the straw which bubbles through the toluene and take long hard hits so hard that my eyes water, hold in for a moment and then take another.  Keep it up until the toluene level in your blood is high enough, (thanks to the straw you still get fresh air) the idea is to get the toluene into your blood and not to asphixiate yourself.

I went to a hilltop near where I live that is wooded but surrounded by the city.  As it is very important to be outside (toluene smells) and I get better trips  in the woods.  I had my usual tolly-bong out and filled it almost half-way with pure toluene.  I sat down on an old slab from some house which used to be there and started to hit my bong.  Your breath should pick up an almost meditative rythm and you will here minor auditory hallucinations first.  I heard the usual trains and planes somewhere.  I personally think this is due to the fact that toluene is related to gasoline and all other petroluem products and on the other side of reality there is another world or worlds.  Then I kept inhaling and the GOOD part of the trip started.  I was 3 or 4 and was sure I had done something wrong, I had to hide.  Then I forgot about that when the leaves on all the plants around me started to point at me.  I mean a REALLY vivid hallucination!!  I actually got down and waved my hand over some vines and the leaves were attracted to my body like a magnet!!  I kind of freaked for a second 'cause the plants wanted to kill me, because I knew their secret, but then I tricked them.  I threw some pennies and because human blood tastes of copper the plants followed the coins and left me alone.

About this time I came down a little.  Still definatly high, but not enough to keep hallucinating.  So I found my bong, which was still sitting where I had left it and sat down and started hitting it again.  This time I was worried that I might be hurting my self or sanity with the tolly.  Every time I hit it again I saw a dozen dwarve demons urging me on and another dozen little fairies telling me to stop.  I hit it again.  This time I realized that the sun was a snakes'eye and that the light was cold not hot.  I had to get in the shade to keep from freezing to death!  Then I somehow lost my bong and started to come down.  With pure toluene there is little or no headache and the major drawback is the smell that will come out of your body for the next 8 to 9 hrs.</bodytext></report>
