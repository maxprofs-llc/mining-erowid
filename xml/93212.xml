I got rather large bush of Coleus (ca.250-300 leaves); first, tried to smoke some leaves dried in oven at 50 degrees C - like 3 big joints - no effect. Then I cut the rest of the leaves in small pieces and kept for some 24 hours in 170 grams of vodka. First tried one shot, no effect, in the next day - rest of the dark, greenish-black liquid. Still, no effect apart from the usual spirit-related dizziness. And the stuff tasted really ugly.</bodytext></report>
