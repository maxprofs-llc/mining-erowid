I've on intensive probation right now, which means that I am on house arrest. I also have to pass 6 random drug tests, so I've been fiening for something to hold me over. I've always been a habitual user of marijuana and occasionally DXM user. Well as time took its toll on me, I was getting desperate for anything around the house. I remember my mom had these herbs she used to make tea. Well I wrote down the names of some and looked online, and Passion Flower and Skullcap happened to be potential psychoactives. They seemed like a last resort, but I was willing to try anything.

I took about 5 tablespoons of each crushed up plant, and put them in a coffee filter. I add peppermint leaves for flavor. I made it hold together with a rubber band, sort of looking like a balloon and made the tea. I drank it at about 3:00 and waited for any noticeable effects, after about 2 hours, I decided to make another cup, using the same method I had the last time. I sat around and watched tv for awhile, hoping maybe this time, I'd feel something, but I was let down again. Maybe the passionflower and skullcap I had wasn't as potent as fresh, because I know my mom had purchased it at an alternative foods store, but drinking tea made from these plants had no effect on me that was noticeable.</bodytext></report>
