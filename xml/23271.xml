As a cautionary note to the readers, I'd really like to share this personal experience in bizarre amnesia. Some of my experiences with Zolpidem have been pretty informative, but right now, I'll just focus on the stupidest combo I can ever remember, even if I can't quite remember it all.

I took my standard dosage of Ambien, 20 milligrams, which I've started chewing to combat the problematic fact that the stuff just doesn't work if there's any food in my belly. If I chew it, it tastes quite bitter and nasty, but it starts to take effect in as little as three minutes, suprisingly. As usual, at some point, I lost track of exactly what was going on. The main problem with Ambien is that I lose that everpresent part of the mind that tells me things like 'damn, you're tripping hard' or 'no, stupid, don't attempt to go for a hike at 3 AM.' Also, I never feel very messed up after I take the Ambien, even though I'm probably certifiable when I'm on the stuff. This particular evening, I'd decided that the Ambien wasn't working well enough, and in my stupor, I guessed that doing a little line of ketamine might help me wander off to bed. Again, it's important to note that I *always* think that I'm completely sober when I take my Ambien. This is false. I'm just so messed up that I can't tell the difference.

Moving on. The ketamine, as far as I know, hit well. The rest of the night is remembered in flashes. I'll do my best to convey what I do have some awareness of. First, I decided, I believe, to clean out my desk drawers. I dumped out the drawer from my plastic mini-chest, and proceeded to put all of its contents back inside in a more rearranged manner. I remember stumbling a lot, and having trouble moving with coordination. Also, and this is not uncommon for me on Ambien, I became aware of a few extra presences in the room. When I think back, I seem to have some sort of attraction to the number six as the number of entities that were floating about. I never actually saw these things, whatever they were, but it was like there were six voices telling me what to do, and how to act. For all I know, they were just my conscious mind, screaming for attention amidst the Ambien-induced insanity. At some point, I think I took more Ambien. My memory of the night isn't very good, so I have no idea how many, but I'd guess one or two. I then took a pencap and dosed myself with a large bump from the bag of ketamine, which increased my problems with coordination and mental function.

At some point, I stumbled into my bed, and I remember lying there, believing that I was flying through a video game that I own (Rez, for the PS2). I woke up a few hours later, at about six o'clock, and found my bag of K lying on the floor, next to the pencap. This reminded me of what had happened. The entire experience feels like a dream. It's just a series of strange images that are burned into my memory in a very half-assed manner. I cleaned up the mess I found, and I was still feeling quite dizzy as I made my way back into bed, following a trip to the kitchen for a bowl of oatmeal.

When I finally got up, I felt drowsy, burnt out, and tremendously pissed at myself for allowing such a stupid thing to happen.</bodytext></report>
