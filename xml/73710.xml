This report is a specific case of using DXM before a drug test, in response to respective the drug-testing vault. To give more background to what drugs are in my system regularly- I am an occasional DXM user - probably 4 to 5 times monthly, and, as of late, use cocaine and marijuana about 2 or 3 times a month each. I am also on the prescription Lexapro and drink alcohol regularly. I have been on this pattern for approximately 3 months.

The other week I had taken 300 mg of DXM in the form of CVS Tussin Cough Liquid Gels at about 1 pm. Since I was rather disappointed with this trip, I decided to take another, stronger dose the following day. This dose consisted of 450 mg of the same brand of Liquid Gels. So I had taken DXM two consecutive days, 300 mg, then 450 mg. The day after I had taken 450 mg I had a job interview. I ended up getting the position, pending a drug test, which we did on the spot.

It, however, was not a urine test. The test I received was a standard oral test, which tested for marijuana, opiates, PCP, and the like. I do not know anymore than that, other than it was a blue, plastic stick that contained a white pad at the end, which tasted rather salty. I had to keep this pad in my mouth for five minutes. It was then shipped to the lab. I received a call the next business day saying that I passed the drug test and got the job.</bodytext></report>
