It was monday night, I was bored and had some california poppy extract (extracted with 60% alcohol).  It was time to smoke before going to bed, but I was not very tired at all.  So I scraped some resin out of my broken pipe and put it in a bowl, along with 4 drops of the california poppy extract.

The first few hits sizzled like cooking eggs and produced a pleasant tasting smoke.  About 10 mins later I had toasted the hell out of the bowl (very hot pipe!).  I noticed a pleasant relaxing opiate-like high.  Only opiate-like not really like any opiates I have tried.  It was less euphoric and more bodily relaxing, my limbs felt very heavy, and i was very relaxed.  I also had an unexplanable head buzz that was cool and lasted for about 15 mins.  The effects were far beyond placebo, the two definatley mixed together well.  For brief moments I could feel myself floating away into anasthetic and colorful realm.  This is when the head buzz was acting.

In short it was a pleasant experience.  Very relaxing for the day after a being nervous for no reason.  I can't say I recommend people putting liquid extracts on weed and smoking it, but I had researched califonia poppy and found no known interaction or overdose cases.  Just allergic reactions.  I still took a gamble, but in this case it did not harm me at all.  It was a very pleasant weed buzz mixed in with a odd opiate-like (without extreme euphoria) head buzz.  But, still i would rather take hydrocodone or smoke opium than this stuff.</bodytext></report>
