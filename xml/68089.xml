I've been an alcoholic for about 6 months or so and it just seems like no matter how much I try to pull away from the stuff it just reels me back in. It's just recently gotten worse. I started off the night with a 14 oz glass of straight alcohol (gin, tequila,  and vodka mixed). I know, it sounds nasty, but I loved the feeling of it all going down my throat. And it makes you drunk faster -- that's what I was aiming for.

I finished the glass rather quickly, like it was orange juice, or so. I was pretty tipsy at that point. I was on the computer, surfing the web, chatting online. I could still function yet I found that I would misspell alot of words, or I'd mix them up. It got worse as the booze soaked in. I was feeling great, and light, like a feather - haha. And all the things on my mind before didn't seem to matter, which was the reason I poured myself such a large glass.

I then went back for more. I was chugging out of each bottle of hard liquor. I just kept on drinking, and taking more and more. I don't remember much past that. I blacked out for sure, for I woke up in my bed upstairs when the last thing I remember was being in the kitchen downstairs.

I woke up surrounded in my own urine (gross, I know). I felt discusting and almost as if I were still a bit drunk. Needless to say, the hangover was HORRIBLE. It was my stomach that was aching. I was very, very miserable.</bodytext></report>
