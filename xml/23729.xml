To begin, the 5-MeO-AMT had been originally sold as LSD, in the form of blotter, with a pitch that it was a 'new strain of acid, lasts 12 hours, psilocybin like.' The actual measurement of the chemical in a paper hit is unknown and unable to be determined, besides the fact that the individual hits could vary in size. From this batch there were also unevenly dosed sheets, where some hits had almost no chemical and others had dangerous amounts, visible though because there were crystals apparently on the sheet. The impression I am given too is that this is not a normal form for this chemical to be ingested. Yet, I found myself possesing a large quantity of it and ready to try some, and interest in the chemical was already piqued by close educated friends who had tried the drug in another form (snorted powder, not recommended as I hear) and they were also in support of people trying it. Interest was also generated because a few people who had eaten the blotter 5-MeO-AMT, thinking it was LSD, never thought it wasn't until they were informed long after the experience. This put me in the mindset to both enjoy and evaluate the drug on its own and in relation to LSD.

The recommended dose is apparently 2 hits. I ate one, out of apprehension and also because with trippy drugs I tend to need very little in order to enjoy and utilize the effects. I ate another 1/2 about 4 or 5 hours later in order to stay with those who were dosing then, but the low amount of the first dose put me in a state where I was both coming down and up for a while. The course of the trip is supposed to be about 12 hours with a normal dose, but the one hit leant for maybe a 6 hour trip, then the other  clouds any more relation to trip length and dosing.

In general, it was a mild and enjoyable trip, putting me in a buzzed and generally goofy and happy mood, complacent in most situations and positions during the night. This was a key element it seemed: the user can enjoy and experience the drug in both a mellow or motionless mental state or in an interactive and energetic social or party state. Actions like sitting or laying of course would lead to a more sedate state of mind and body, while constant stimulation from friends or laughing would heighten the speedy parts of the buzz and bring you back into that realm, or keep you there. I think this also facilitates and feeds the intensity of the trip much like certain things will with LSD.

In general, I experienced sensory heightening and distortion, but little confusion or apprehension due to the lack of synthesis of the senses.  Music was enjoyable, especially combined with the body buzz and any degree of dancing. Slight visual distortions began to develop but i suspect more with more of the chemical. The night sky and beach setting i encountered for a short portion during the trip were very enjoyable as both visual and a peaceful place to be, yet they usually are. The drug seemed to add the twinkles and color gradients in the sky and stars and tree setting that LSD will often do. Some closed eye visual stimulation, but mental was more enjoyed then, and I was also watching and interacting with what was going on most of the night, so there wasn't a lot of chance for closing the eyes. The body sensations like I said are a tad speedy, buzzed, but enjoyable and resemble MDMA a bit. I also experienced eye wiggles (i forget what they are called) two or three times during the trip, but not surrounding an discernable serotonin or serotonin-like rush similar to when that happens on ecstacy, it was kind of random and reminded me of the way DXM will inadvertantly make your eyes dart around, causing visual distortions, at least how i think of it.

Mentally, the drug was very stimulating yet easy to explore and not-easily clouded. Closing the eyes leant more to mental exploration than a great visual show. Thought seemed to glide along nice paths, randomly connecting and assimilating but not growing into epic proportions or leading to extremely disjointed states or large conclusions/revelations like when on LSD. This element stuck around for 2+ days after ingesting, and was enjoyed. Mental and cognitive action as a result of the trip really surprised me, by the time the drug left I feel like I had gotten a whole lot more out of it then medium grade LSD trip.

Smoking weed definitely heightened the effects, but not to dangerous or scary levels and contributed to the general happy warmness that came along with it. Once i began smoking weed on the drug i was more complacent to be on both of them then one alone. This continued throughout the experience, into the next morning and day and did not contributing to an extreme brain dead-ness that usually happens when one has been on LSD and smoking the entire time. This is what stood out to me at that point, 12 hours after taking such a low dose. I never slept that day, only entered hibernating-like states, with the body worn out but the mind still going. The drug fades out like LSD but extremely slower, so it seems, which in my case allowed for a much enjoyed next couple of days and an awareness that cognitive paths and connections were a lot more active and interesting. This is what sold me on the drug. I expected an extreme wraughtness after being on and not sleeping, I expected some point where I could go no more and would conk out, unwakeable, like after an LSD trip. I expected to be brain dead or feel worn out after finally being able to sleep. None of that happened, and the slow decline of the drug and the experience made for a wholly great one as well as the rest of the weekend. Of course, a bad trip on the drug would result in an extreme dislike at this fact that it sticks around forever.

There also appeared to be passive time dilation, but not active. At certain points I would check the clock and be surprised at how early it was, for it felt that MUCH more time had passed by, though I never felt an actively perceived time dilation, something like when on LSD and objects and their movement in your visual field slow down so much that its obvious that time is dilated. Basically, a lot more was perceived to be accomplished or experienced in a given time span than normally would without the drugs, even if all the circumstances and vibes were the same.

Sensitivity to vibes or other peoples energies was also very high but did not reach scary or problematic points for me. There was some sensory edginess that would come with spikey vibes, either from unwanted visitors or loud, rambunctious people, but it was not hard to deal with and usually I would change my setting and be fine. I think I am also particularly sensitive to things like that, but I also know that my perceptions can become very lucid and heightened while tripping sometimes, and with respect to that 5-MeO-AMT was very similar to vibe sensitivity like LSD or psilocybin is. However, while the set and setting help feed or shape the situation on the drug, the mood of the user seems to be predetermined by the drug and for the most part the user should be on a happy buzz.

Thats all I can say about it for now. It should be a fun summer.</bodytext></report>
