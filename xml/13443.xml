Mostly good

I am now coming off the prescribed drug Paroxetine that I have been on for the past 6 months. I am now down to 10 mg a day, down from 20mg and am looking forward to getting off the train.

Does it help?

Yes, but it does have a twist. Confidence levels, happiness and contentment all rise and I have suffered no major problems.

Although one concern with this drug is the effect it has when I am drinking. I am an urban professional with a good job, house etc. and an experienced drug user now living in Singapore. So you know that means capital punishment for drugs. I call this the biggest Betty Ford clinic in the world! Good for me anyhow.

Do I recommend Paroxetine, yeah, I would as it has helped but it does put me in a Disneyland state and my friends and family have noticed a change in me so I have decided to stop. I changed from a shy bolshy individual to somewhat arrogant and careless. The pro's being I dont give a stuff what other people think which is not good when it is important that people think good of you! A paradox.

So the end of it is, if you drink heavily like I do, Be Careful as not only do I make a fool of myself I can hurt myself by having an accident. E.g. waking up with a cut and bruise on my head as I think I had a minor fit, lying in a pool of piss on my hard tile bedroom floor. Not good.

I dont know about any other antidepressants, this did help as it has made me somewhat less shy and I will now live a fuller life without this constraint. But I now have to get off it and plan to by the next two week. So now I get to deal with all the withdrawals I am apparently going to get. As for drugs in general. I do em on Friday to rest up before Monday for work, every other weekend to let my brain regroup, and dont do to many!</bodytext></report>
