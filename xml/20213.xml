3oz. of galangal rhizoms were purchased for a local herb store. the dark red root bits were ground in a coffee grinder until powdered. the essential oils and other ethanol solluble products were removed via cold finger(tm) extraction device with ethanol as the solvant. the ethanol was evaporated from the resulting solution using a hot air based food dehydrator. the resulting residue had two distinct fractions (a clear dark red oilly liqued and a slightly cloudy more pitch-lik, light colored, sediment). with out discretion, this mixture was pilled up into ordinary gell caps for a total of 10.5 caps. (the .5 cap was mostly full of the dark liquid) 4.5 caps were then ingested orally in rapid succession with cold water as a chaser.
