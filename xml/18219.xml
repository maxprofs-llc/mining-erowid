i have done all sorts of drugs and have been doing drugs heavily for about five years now. i somehow managed not to really get into opiates.... so i found myself in for a real treat.

this feeling was like the high i always wanted. it was that of bliss and heaven. i was happy and content with my life while on the drug. i didnt feel lonely at all. i had a greater apriciation for music, which i was listening to all night. it brought out great artistic abilites in me and i drew 2 amazing pictures. this was soooo much fun.
