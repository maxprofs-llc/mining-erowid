Third Voyage to San Pedro

The following is copied directly from my field notes with clarifying information added days later as denoted by [].

3-02-06:  50 grams of dried T. Peruvanius are gently boiled for about 6 hours.  During the boiling the juice of 6 lemons is added, and halfway through the cactus is removed, ground up in a blender, and returned to the pot.  After the boiling the material is filtered through an old cotton t-shirt and the liquid returned to the pot for reduction.  The filtered plant material is very bland tasting and the liquid is very bitter  this is good.  Cooking stops when the brown liquid has reached about 8 ounces.  The liquid is divided and stored in two jars in the refrigerator.

3-03-06, Friday, 8:00 am: I am in good spirits and looking forward to the day.  Physically Im good, last nights headache is gone with only a slight residual pressure remaining.  For the past few days I have eaten mostly a vegan diet.  My wife is on the way out for the weekend.  This morning she told me she understands this is part of my spirituality.  This makes me happy and more at ease.

8:30 am:  Skipped breakfast and instead chugged half of the bitter brown liquid (4 oz) followed by a fresh grapefruit juice chaser [The taste is so bitter and strange that even weeks later just thinking about it makes me a bit nauseas!].
/n
/n
8:45 am:  Mild queasiness and feeling that something is beginning to happen.  Surprising that this is happening so fast.
/n
/n
9:05 am:  Second half of the liquid is consumed.  Takes a bit more will power to get it down.  Still queasy, and it is definitely beginning to kick in.  Took a puff of pot for nausea which seems to help.  Hmmmm, Im beginning to trip!
/n
/n
9:20 am:  Oh yeah, this is why I trip!  To remember to be in the moment.  Lying on the couch with pets.  The brain is definitely processing visual signals a bit slower.  Depth perception is off too.  The shower curtain appears twice as far away as it should but the colors from it are right next to my head.  My body is beginning to writhe.  It feels good!  Nausea still a bit bothersome so Ill go smoke it back into submissions and look at the daffodils.  
/n
/n
9:50 am:  Back in the house the lingering smell of cooked cacti nearly negates my previous medications.  Playing with hand shadows.  Hmmmm, noticeably impaired (and spelling poorly, too).  Mentally the core of me is given a quick lookover and deemed to be noble, strong, and humble.  [It is difficult to summarize exactly what was happening here.  Elements of me (my core) were systematically separated from one another and held up for inspection.  I looked at some events that shape who I am, including the unfortunate ones to which I responded as a nurturing parent, recognizing how Ive learned from them.  This is where the humble reference comes from.  There was a closed eye visual aspect to this where I was actually seeing strips of my core peeled off, each being a distinct piece, whether it be a formative experience or a personality characteristic.]

1:45 pm:  Coming out of a continuous orgasm many hours in length.  It was a way into the planets vibrations.  Thank goodness I wasnt in public for that!  Its so bright outside, its as if the area is covered in snow on a bright day.  Drinking water is a good and necessary thing to do.  Tea too complicated to make  would take the committees consent. [The Committee often appears in my head while tripping and serves to consider every aspect of whatever action is being considered, usually resulting in inaction.  Even to get up off the couch takes quite a bit of effort.  So many aspects involved in making tea that it is just impossible right now.]
/n
/n
1:55 pm:  Message out to my wife  its me in here, the same one, and having a fine time of it.  I love you!  Pupils quite dilated.  Each of the magnolias white flowers looks so beautiful to me.  Spent a great hour in the hammock  I could really manipulate its movements with only slight rustling on my part.
/n
/n
3:30 pm:  Back from a lovely trip around the block with P.  We both feel energized from it.  Listen to the sound of being.  Feathers and leaves blow by in the wind.

This was definitely the correct means  still cant think about cacti too long.  Pretty easy on the body so far.  Not much visually other than... [Visuals then began to increase.  Geometric ghost images fill in the space between the wall and my eyes.  Not very intense, but interesting.]
/n
/n
Good connection back to childhood, though my hands appear to age 50 years, then go back, then repeat.  Hmmmmm. [This was quite odd.  The flesh and fingernails on my hands would age 50 years, appearing rougher, then just snap back.  This happened several times and was very realistic.]
/n
/n
4:30 pm:  More visual stuff happening in the shadows.
/n
/n
6:20 pm:  Tripping hard but able to eat some.  Some headache, so I take 3 ibuprophen and 1 ultram.
/n
/n
9:35 pm:  Back from a spin around the block with P (at 9).  Cooking pasta and water for tea.  My hands still look quite different.  Feeling good.  Will call my wife soon to wish her good night.

This cactus brings me in tune with some Gaia-like sense.  I move with the energy ebbing and flowing through me.

Remembering the two city workers who took out a water valve from the neighbors house earlier today.  I watched to see if they are really FBI/CIA.  Did not observe anything obvious (no electronic devices apparently hidden).

Its been a day of recognizing just how good it is.  Looking at the source code and finding it solid.  Mmmmm, the vegan pesto is so good it brings me back to the day it was harvested.
/n
/n
9:51 pm:  Vitamins.
/n
/n
11:30 pm:  Just back from a wonderful hour and a half shower.  Great sex!
/n
/n
11:56 pm:  Back from sitting in The Chair and watching the stars while smoking a bowl.  Life is good.  The radio has a nice mellow string of jazz tunes.  I miss my wife while gnawing on the most perfect brownie Ive ever eaten.  Ever!  Fortunately this has been a worthwhile experience.  
/n
/n
4:45 am:  Turning in.  Still alert but probably will be able to sleep.  A bit of a mild headache but not so bad.  About an hour ago I took 3 ibuprophin and  ultram.  The past hour or so I watched The Outer Limits on television.  It was appropriately about space aliens finding earth from a different dimension.  
/n
/n
3-04-06, Saturday, 8:45 am:  Welcome back!  Still feeling a bit spacey and have some head pressure. And feeling like something big and important happened.  Ive taken a long, deep look at myself and found everything to be good.
/n
/n
Spent the rest of the day taking ibuprophin and ultram for a headache.  It was a mild one lasting most of the day, but not nearly as bad as the last time I did this.  The dog and I went for a long walk at the Eno River.  The following morning I woke up feeling great, though maybe a little tired.</bodytext></report>
