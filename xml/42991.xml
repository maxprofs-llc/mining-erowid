First dose I took was 20mg oral. After taking that I sat in front of the computer and listend to some music. About an hour goes by and still no much of an affect. After that I took another 20mg. 30 min go bye now I am starting to fell a little out of place and slowed. My body fells a little heavier. I honestly don't know if it was worth my time.</bodytext></report>
