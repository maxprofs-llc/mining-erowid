I found a bottle of 30 lyrica capsules. i took them and felt relaxed. I was on Xanax, Klonopin, and Restoril awhile back, and was a big pharmaceutical abuser. I knew Lyrica was Schedule 5 for some reason. I took about 5-10 of the 50mg capsules and felt the sedation and euphoria from benzos and barbituates.
