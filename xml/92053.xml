Prelude: I have experience with MDMA, Speed, am a long term user of Ritalin, smoked weed often, and have taken mushrooms every now and then. I love dancing, no matter if completely sober or intoxicated.

Friday Night: Met with 2 Friends, and left for our usual meeting point, a park on the fringes of a nearby major city. There were about 40-50 familiar people there, and about 20 which I would consider Friends. Drank a beer, and at 20:00 I took the first 60 mg's of 4-FMP. Noticed slight euphoric effects half an Hour later, and talked slightly more than usual. Took another 60 mg's at 20:30, and by 21:00 I began experiencing a definitive euphoria, and a strong sympathy towards the people surrounding me, much like MDMA, yet slightly weaker, and much more controllable. I talked alot, and was very direkt, but always meant well, and when I wanted to, I could easily supress the talking / openness, unlike MDMA, which tends to overcome me. The Stimulating side began to take over at 22:00, where we (me + one Friend) started leaving from this meetingplace, to a Club of the EBM/Industrial Scene. Had to go by train, felt very controlled on the way.

Arrived at 23:15, took another 60 mg Dose at 23:30, and started Dancing. Even though I had an exhausting day, movement was easy, and felt good, not in the slightest way I tired. Took the last 60 g dose at 0:30, and felt Great! Only ever stopped dancing this evening to get a drink of water. At 1:30 I sniffed a small line of acceptable grade Amphetamine, just to keep the night going. From then on, Just nonstop dancing till 4:00. 4-Fmp was proving to be an awesome Club/Dance Drug for me. Had to leave at 4 as my Friend had to work next day, and we both had to get up and be in acceptable state by 12, took until 6 to get to my mates house, I continued to dance in the train, listening to Music on my Mp3-Player. Then it took me till 7:30 to go to sleep, then however sleeping until 11:30, and waking up completely refreshed.

Experiencing slight MDMA like Depression on Monday  Tuesday, however it is possible that there is no connection between the drug use and this. I would definitely take it again.</bodytext></report>
