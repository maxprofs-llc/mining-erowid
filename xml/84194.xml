Last night I was sitting at school trying to study for a macroeconomics test.  I took a 20 mg instant release Adderall to help study but the 'edginess' that Adderall gives me is not pleasant at all.  A few of my buddies come into my room to borrow the waterfall I made for the specific purpose of smoking this new Spice stuff.  We found out about it about a month ago, and we have all smoked it regularly since then.  We are subject to random drug tests and, while I do not enjoy the stuff at all, the effects are just what I need to relax at the end of the day.  I went to their room to smoke a bong and it did the job of cutting the jitters from the Adderall.  I got done studying for one test, looked at the clock and realized it was only 11:00 PM.  I still had time to study for my other test, but it was time for my reward for studying like I should have.  I left to find some more spice.  I talked to a few people and found out that another kid a few floors down from me had some epic shit.  I went in and saw the package; it was called 'Space.'  He packed a bong and I ripped it.  A few minutes later I start feeling the calming aspect of the drug and returned to my room satisfied.

Now this is where things get a little strange.  Let me start off by saying I have tried a fair amount of drugs.  I have done shrooms and acid as far as hallucinogens go, but this was completely different than any other trip I have had.  And yes, this was definitely a trip.  The following is completely true (at least as much as I can remember.)

15 minutes in:  I'm feeling really strange.  When I turn my head it takes a few seconds for my vision to catch up to where I am looking.  I have a tingling sensation all over my body, which is actually kind of enjoyable.  I remember that I still have a test to study for, so I get up and lock my door.  I make it back to my bed, and I find that walking or any other kind of simple movement is exponentially harder than it should be.  I literally fall on my bed.

20 minutes:  The only sense that is working correctly is my sense of hearing.  There is music playing from my computer, but I can't see, feel, smell ANYTHING.  This is where the trip starts.  For the duration of the trip I had no idea who or where I was.  It honestly felt like I was dying and this was what death was like.  My mind was completely separate from my body, and I'm not entirely sure where it was.  I remember feeling like I was being completely pulled apart, and I remember finding that it was hard to breath.  For some reason I remember thinking that I had completely fucked my life up, and it was going to be like this forever.  Maybe if I wasn't by myself this would not have been so bad, but I really don't think I would have been responsive enough to understand what anyone was saying to me anyway.  When I started coming out of the really intense part of the trip it felt like I had been out of it for much longer than I actually had.

30 minutes in (+/-):  I come to and I am falling towards my chair, I hit it, and fall to the floor by my desk.  I'm guessing my shoulder hit it because it is really bruised now.  I have no idea who I am, where I am, or what I just did.  It felt like I was born out of nothing, right there on my floor.  I hear knocks at my door, which scares me so I don't answer it (I doubt I could have if I wanted to.)  I had to literally crawl on the floor for a few minutes to regain any kind of balance and finally made it back to my bed.  I am starting to regain my perspective of who and where I am, but this is a slow process.

35-40 minutes:  I'm starting to figure out that this was a trip, but things are still really strange.  I'm not as scared of it now, but I am still really freaked out.  My nerves feel fried, I can barely think of anything aside from how fucked up I am.  I lay there for about 10 more minutes because after the intense part of the trip was over it was much more enjoyable, more like a high than a trip.  Sometime after this ten minutes I fell asleep.

Now like I said, I am extremely familiar with the effects of marijuana, shrooms and acid, as well as spice.  This was like nothing I had ever done before.  It felt like I was gone for days.  I'm sorry that this report isn't better, but I simply can't remember enough of what happened to give it a fair analysis.  A few of my friends also tried this 'Space' last night, and all with similar effects.  This stuff literally scared me, and the fact that it was bought over the counter makes it even scarier.</bodytext></report>
