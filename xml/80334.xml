0:02 I am extremely happy and feel very hot and the air around me envelopes my skin causing a tingly sensation. I have a fast heart rate and I am sweating; everything is very funny and I laugh at almost anything.

0:05 My pupils are fully dilated and I am sweating but I am extremely happy and dance music makes me even happier. I am extremely paranoid and feel so happy.
