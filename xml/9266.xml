I had been taking 300 of bupropion for depression already for several months.  Sometimes to get a boost before morning class I would pop 25-50 mg of ephedrine.  One such morning I had no ephedrine so I decided to try the bupropion up the snoot to see if it had a different kick.  I crushed one 150 mg tablet and cut it into four large lines.  When I snorted it back it burned painfully, like pure amphetamine.  This coupled with the size of the lines needed made this activity for strictly diehards.

After about 20 minutes of nasty drip my brain perked up notably.  Colors became more vivid, I felt enthusiastic and a bit giggly.

At 45 minutes I was pepped up good, not the edgy nerves of ephedrine but the more subtle stimulation of a small dose of good coke.  The long half-life of bupropion gave the feeling legs.  Over the next 4 hours my high peaked gently and faded away before being lost in the common fizzle of my mind.

While the activity itself is rather unpleasant the boost was quite enjoyable.  Soon I was bringing a flap of crushed bupropion with me when I was partying.  Great for when the cops stopped me.  With a prescription for the stuff they can't detain me and they don't seem to like that.</bodytext></report>
