I had some friends visit from out of town for a low scale party that I was having.  Each friend brought over whatever they could find, which ended up being a lot.  After partying it up all night, I could tell that the only drugs that were still in my system at that time were LSD and adderall, so I figured that I would try to end my night.  I remembered that I had recently ordered some kratom and that it is used as a depressant.  Well, I brewed up some tea for myself and the other two friends that were tripping with me.  We all drank the tea, and a few minutes later we all noticed an increase in our visual hallucinations.  It was relaxing and pleasant simultaneously.  I don't know if other people experienced this, but me and the two of my friends all noticed similar effects.  There are other variables that might have played a role in this, but I am just reporting what I noticed.</bodytext></report>
