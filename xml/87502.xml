200mg (10,000% RDA) of B-6 * 15 (low I know!) Mg of 5-HTP = Serotonin Syndrome (search that if you're unsure what it is &amp; considering combining these two), MASSIVE stomach cramps, &amp; 3 days of what I came to wonder was permanent diarrhea (not funny at the time!).

These are a known combo, but my (importantly sensitive to serotonin, I believe) experience was: if I mix THIS MUCH B-6 with even a small amount (50-100mg is recommended, I take 15mg) of 5-HTP I'm in for a bad trip &amp; peripherial neuropathy, I have pain in my feet now. So - not to be a nag, I love my cannabis, alcohol, extasy, mushrooms, amphetamines (in moderation - 5 mg of adderall, e.g.), but some things don't mix, &amp; this is where that metaphor comes from; don't mix drugs that are bad for you in combination.

Otherwise 5-HTP helped my insomnia (while I took it in reasonable &amp; in safe-combination dosages), specifically the longer term sleeping, like hours 4-8. I have a physical insomnia &amp; it worked great. Tomorrow or the next day I start trazodone. Wish me zzz's =P

Anyway, be very careful (small dose starts, slow dose increases - AND do your homework;) when mixing any drugs, but especially these.

Otherwise, naturomeds rule!
