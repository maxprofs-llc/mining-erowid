I've been meaning to write this report for a while.  I only had 2 San Pedro experiences prior to this.  All 3 experiences were each from a one foot section of a 36 inch San Pedro cutting.  This particular trip was the top section of the cactus, and it had been sitting in a shoe box in my closet for about a week.

For this trip I decided to separate the white flesh and as much of the waxy skin as I could from the dark green alkaloid rich tissue.  I blended and boiled the cactus for about 3 hours with distilled water.  I then separated the plant material from the brown liquid and began evaporating the brown liquid.  Now this is where things get interesting.

A friend stopped by and we decided to go play some frisbee golf at a local park.  Considering that my first experience yielded a light trip, and my second experience was a medium trip, I figured 'why not.'  And gulped down about a cup of dark brown cactus slime.  By the way, this stuff isn't nearly as bad as people say.  I found that by using only the dark green layer plant material, I use less water to boil it, therefore less 'tea' to drink.  I'd advise chasing each gulp of 'tea' with lemon or lime juice.  Also I noticed on my 2nd trip that there was much less stomach cramping when I used less white cactus flesh.

So I was only expecting a mild, medium trip.  After about an hour at the park I returned home and I knew I was coming up.  I was getting some light to medium stomach cramping, but nothing major.  As I walked around the house attempting to do some laundry, I realized that I might be in for much more than I expected.  During my first two experiences the carpet was moving like water during the peak.  This time the carpet was rapidly moving during the come up.  As this time I realized I was probably in for a treat and again said to myself 'why not' and used a little water to get the extra cactus slime left stuck to the walls of the evaporating dish and gulped that down too.

The next few hours were a blur, I was alone in my house pretty much glued the couch, watching the sunset. Everything was beautiful to say the least.  Everything had a glow to it.  White walls looked colorful and swayed back and forth.  The carpet continued to move up and down.  Everything had that mescaline 'glow' and was very beautiful.  For a moment it all became very intense, and almost frightening.  I was tripping very hard, I was having a sensory overload.  Unlike acid or mushrooms, I found that mescaline was a positively charged trip.  After my near freak out, I was quickly overcome with a sense that 'it'll be alright, don't worry'.  Whereas when I've tripped really hard on acid or mushrooms it was much much scarier.

Sorry I don't have a very good time table, but after about 6 hours of the beautiful mescaline glow and swirling beautiful colorful open eye visuals, my girlfriend came over.  Mescaline can be very powerful but also very gentle, and my girlfriend didn't even know I was tripping.  Sex was INCREDIBLE!  Some of the craziest violently vibrating colors (closed eye visuals), almost tribal looking patterns during orgasm. After sex my girlfriend went to sleep and I threw on my headphones and listened to all sorts of music for an hour or so.

The best part, after about roughly 9-10 hours of tripping balls, I was able, for the first time in my psychedelic history, to fall asleep while still tripping pretty hard.  Right before I went to sleep I saw something that also reminded me of the positive charge of the trip.  While staring at swirling colors on the ceiling I saw a pair of eyes staring back at me.  Like a guardian of some sort.  Also before falling asleep I saw something I could only describe as not seeing, if this makes any sense, my eyes were open, but parts of my field of vision would go blank and I'd have to close my eyes.  Like I was seeing something I wasn't supposed to, possibly a glimpse of the divine?  Maybe I was seeing some light wave length my eyes couldn't interpret.  Probably sounds insane, but it's a testament to hard I was tripping when I fell asleep.

Overall I got MUCH more than I expected!!!  I found the trip extremely fun but it wasn't as insightful as I would have liked.  It was a great experience overall and I plan on giving San Pedro another try.  I've done acid about 15 times and mushrooms about 50 times and I'd have to say this was probably one of my top 3 trips of all time.</bodytext></report>
