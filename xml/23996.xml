Last night, I was bored out of my mind. Besides for caffeine pills, I had never gotten high. I had heard about nutmeg, so I decided to give it a shot. I was concerned that my medication, 50 mg of Zoloft, might get in the way; I tried it anyway. I knew how disgusting it tastes, so I mixed 1.5 tablespoons with 1.5 cups of applesauce; the applesauce hid the taste well. As soon as I was finished at about 6:45 p.m., I felt slightly buzzed.

At 7:45, I went to see the Matrix with my dad-- I thought it would be a trippy experience. By the time the movie had started, I had cottonmouth and had already drank 1.5 liters of water. But I definitely did feel SOMETHING, and I was thoroughly enjoying it.

I left halfway through the movie to go to the bathroom. When I exited the theater I felt a little bit confused; the room looked like it was positioned differently, and I couldn't figure out where in the theater I was. I felt pleasantly heavy and warm as I walked.

By the end of the movie at about 10:20, I was definitely feeling the effects. I went to the restroom and looked in the mirror; my face looked really weird and my eyes looked like alien's eyes. As I was leaving the bathroom, which was empty, I heard a stall door swing open. I was pretty sure it was in my head, but it scared the shit out of me. I thought that if I stuck around any longer, I would hallucinate a person in the stall. So I dashed out the door.

On the ride home, I kept seeing the reflection of rain on the car seats; it looked beautiful and liquid. I felt very calm. The whole ride my dad was talking to me, but I kept zoning out. For some strange reason, I kept assuming my dad was talking to my grandfather, his father-in-law, even though he wasn't there. I had strange but fun deja-vu feelings during the drive. I think my favorite part of the high was the ride.

When I got home, I ate a slice of pizza. At 12:00 midnight, I decided I wanted a more extreme high and took another .5 tablespoon with water. The taste wasn't too terrible.

I decided that watching Fantasia downstairs with the lights off would be a trippy experience. I got under the covers, laying down on the couch, feeling very peaceful and serene. It felt as if the couch was level with the ground. Soon I started hearing my dog walking around, but I think I might have been hearing things because I heard him walking around A LOT, and it started to scare me. The movie had just started when I apparently dozed off without knowing it.

I have no recollection of this, but my mother says that at about 1:00 a.m., she came downstairs and woke me up. At that point I must have fallen asleep in my own bed, where I woke up at 10:00 a.m., feeling very serene. My whole body was calm and I felt so serene when I woke up. I loved this feeling, and I had it all day. When I woke up, I looked at my hand, which looked very strange to me for some reason; my fingers looked very long. I got up to walk to the bathroom and walking was hard. My face looked strange in the mirror, but my eyes were not red.

Basically, I did not hallucinate at all but it was an awesome experience which I will always remember and look back on. I still have cottonmouth a day later, but I have been drinking water. I did not suffer any negative side effects, probably because I've kept myself hydrated. I am planning on trying nutmeg again tomorrow in a slightly higher dose, so that maybe I will hallucinate. I think that last night, I fell asleep during the most extreme part of my high, which may be why I did not hallucinate. But I highly reccomend nutmeg to everyone. It is a unique experience that is different for everyone. Have fun and be safe!
