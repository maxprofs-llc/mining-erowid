OK so I had previously tried 30mg of 5-MeO-DALT and was not overly impressed. Felt like a low mushroom dose.

Thinking this I feed it to a friend and had weighed out 100mg but somehow his weighed 30mg after splitting it in caps and mine was 25mg so I guess he ended up going over the 30mg 'max dose' and his experience was completely intense visual and mental psychedelic. I'd compare it to an eighth of P. cubensis like really good Cubes. He was highly anxious and kept commenting on the waves and waviness of everything and how it was like the trees were saying 'what's up' to him...

Another friend did ~25mg and had nowhere near as intense a trip. Only 'mild' and kinda stoned feeling. The former was fasting all day and did it on empty stomach while on prednisone and took a 500mg vitamin C tablet. The latter had just eaten two pieces of pizza and was not on any medication except some Kimchi potpourri he had smoked. He also took 500mg vitamin C.</bodytext></report>
