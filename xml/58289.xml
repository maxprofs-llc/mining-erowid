We stayed up partying and drinking rum all night until the sun came up.  We were totally intoxicated.  We quit drinking alcohol and popped 54 mg of Concerta (I bit mine open).  We were totally wasted.  We had to drive to the airport in Pittsburg, over 2 hours away, in about 1 hour.

On the way there we felt alive and awake, still buzzing from the alcohol and feeling the speed from the pills.  We talked and had a pretty good time the whole way there and felt pretty alert and awake, although I'm sure we were anything but those exact descriptions in all reality. Anyhow, we got to the airport, and while waiting for our people to arrive, it started to hit us.  Extreme hangover-like body fatigue and mental confusion.  When everyone was in the car, heading back home, everything that I said seemed to me like I was stuttering and slurring and having trouble linking thoughts together.  I was feeling this nasty, overwhelming rush on top of fatigue and inability to think.  It was bad.  I've dabbled in a LOT of speed and other drugs.  This sucked.  The whole way home I had paranoia.

When we got home I ran upstairs and tried to lay flat on the bed.  Mind you, this is about 4 or 5 pm now, long time after I dosed.  I laid there and could see my heart pounding in my chest way too fast, pounding hard, and beating in my ears.  I really wasn't sure what to do and was quite freaked.  Nothing I did helped.  I had to deal with it and the fear of it until about 10 pm when I was able to reach a heart rate safe enough to attempt Benadryl-induced calming, which did help, but I have to be careful using antihistamines (which are the same as your OTC sleep medicines) for brining a sleepy state.  I can get muscle aches that will plague me and give me just as much hell.  Nonetheless, I recovered fine as far as I know.  I have been in a similar 'heart-related' panic situation before with crack, no doubt, it was also my last association with that substance.

As a note, a few months ago, the morning after being drunk (I was a bit hung-over), I had the strange sudden onset of heart palpitations and rapid and irregular heartbeat.  I have never had any heart problems in the past other than those which were obviously caused by drug use.  This episode lasted about 15 minutes and was also accompanied by shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and a strong sensation of passing out (which I didn't).  Mind you, this episode was the day after a night of drinking, I didn't use any speed or other substances that night.  I had one more previous heart-freaking episode after a caffiene overdose.

I had an EKG done which showed some nonspecific ST-T wave changes, which is, just as it states, nonspecific.  Maybe there is some damage done.  I probably will never know.  Take it for what you will, but keep in mind as you dabble in speeds (I still do), that once you damage your heart, the damage is done.  Be careful.  I do baby steps now.  I find my nicely prescribed dose of Adderall XR 20 is good to keep me baselined.  Don't be too ready to rush that you forget where you could be rushing off to.  I'm actually a cardiology medical transcriptionist, so I have some real background in my message.</bodytext></report>
