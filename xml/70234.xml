My friend suffers from MD, and when this drug first hit shelves, he got a sample bottle from his doc. The next day he handed me one.

01:00 The drug turned on me suddenly, I was glued and could not move but still felt euphoric, I had all this energy but couldn't move if I wanted to.

06:00 Coming down, had a wonderful time. Like xanax valium and hydros mixed into one pill. The bottle said that users feel 'high' and that past drug abusers should not take them. I believe it now!</bodytext></report>
