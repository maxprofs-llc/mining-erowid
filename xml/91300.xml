25iNBOMe + 6-APB Combo T.R.
/n
/n
9.45 Injest 100mg 6-APB with my life partner well call her S
/n
10.30 Start to notice slight change in mood, light anxiety and antsy feeling that normally accompanies a 6-APB experience
/n
11.30 Full effects of 6-APB are noted we proceed to watch tv and caress each other we had a long day at the pool and are both overly sunburnt. S notes an increased feeling of drowsiness and I suspect its the 6 in its early phases certainly gives me the feeling of wanting to be bundled up with my eyes closed with my love.
/n
12.00 We ingest approx 1.5mg of 25iNBOMe intranasally no burn or drip is noted prob due to the miniscule amount of 25i that is needed for a quite intense trip.
/n
/n
I had candyflipped a lot as a youngster(mdma+lsd) but this will be my fist time combining these 2 ultra unique substances and I assure S that we are in for a hell of a ride. We start with some house music and the black light to set the mood house music always puts me in a good mood regardless of my current mindstate so i thought it would be a good way to enter into uncharted territorys. Dj Venoms Exit to Hard House is one of my all time favorite house albums so we start with that and 
/n
eventually mix into badboybills house connection 2 we also always have the xbox360 visualizations on because its always a great way to enter a good mindfucking. 
/n
/n
12.30 Effects of the 25i are becoming more and more noticeable with slight jaw tension and increased auditory appreciation/perception. I consider taking another 500ug of 25i but decide to wait because of previous experiences with nbome25 becoming extremely potent on seemingly baseline dosage. S is laying on the floor with that starry eyed suprised look on her face and I can tell shes in heaven. I notice its becoming slightly easier to type to the music even thou the only light is from the tv
/n
and blacklight. I assume that my pupils are reaching saucer size. I notice small visual distortions of color on the screen as I type this and the black lettering seems have a rainbow outline around it. Slight stimulation is noted although it is not at all overwhelming more like amazing. The music is really bringing my concious to a elevated plane that seems to be steadily rising. I'm sweating on my face and palms and an intense euphoria is growing inside of my chest, it really makes the sunburn
/n
feel distant. I relize I'm in for it with a steadily rising ++ on the shulgin scale at this point. I  can speak for both of us just by the body language and the vibe shes sharing. I'm considering changing the music to my dubstep playlist because that always seems to usher in some amazing OEVs but decide to wait because  there will be plenty of time for that later.
/n
/n
12.45 Me and S start making out and it is spectacular I can feel every milimeter of her tounge on mine and the sensation is undescribable. Its becoming slightly harder to type as it seems the 25i is really starting to get into me and I am uncordinated because I'm in such awe of these substances. I reminiss in my mind of other times I've encountered this state of being. I think to myself although 25i has an incredible visual aspect it seems to sometime lack the depth of LSD that I had sometimes
/n
let get a little out of control but the state I'm in now certainly tops previous experiments, probably because this is the first time I've combined a potent psycadelic with an intense empathogen in quite sometime.
/n
/n
1.00 the trip has shifted into an intense spiral of emotions and fantasy with situations playing in my head of night clubs and my baybe with stars in her eyes. I see neon lights illumination the dance floor as we share an icebreakers sour with our tounges it is almost too much sensation to handle and I have to remind myself were I am and what is unfolding around me. The music sounds enchanted with a sence of the music really taking me everywere want to be. I smoke a cigarette and the smoke billows around my face with sparks and lightning, I'm reminded of other times when my mood has been so elevated. I decide to start my dubstep playlist.
/n
/n
1.15 The visualations in my head almost match the actual enhancement on my actual vision. The sheer bliss that is felt through each song is truly beyond words. Me and S share such an intense bond and understanding for each other its euphoric in itself, just considering the limitless boundaries of our minds in sync as one. The empathogenic release is truly amazing as it pertains to the sheer mindfuckery thats going on and it seems as if the 6apb adds to the emptiness that I sometimes experience on 25inbome. I'd say that the 2 make for an incredible explosion of emotion and hallucination creeping up on a +++ experience.
/n

S takes over typing: ( I have Lost Interest In trying to describe what was happening and I want to embrace the madness.)
/n
/n
S apparently stands for sexy and I actually have a pair of underwear that have an S on them which I bought for the same reason as he's calling me that. L, obviously, is having the experience of a lifetime. He realizes that we're on the brink of something completely new and no one else has done this yet. It is absolutely a very amazing experience. Earlier I was laying on the floor and only cleared my throat, but I heard it echo in the music. Also, I keep seeing weird shit in the smoke around.
/n
/n
L is on another page all together. He says it's beautiful. The colors and music coordinate so well and it's heavenly. He says he's enchanted, Feels like it's more than just what we did, it's a part of him. This music kicks ass. I love dancing and I really hope that I'm keeping up with myself. The smallest infraction of light traces the whole way across the room. He feels tastes and hears everything coordinating exactly the right way like it's been predetermined by something that obviously knows more than us. He's bobbing his head to the music and he looks really happy.
/n
/n
I must be on one of my down rolls, only because I'm not dancing right now instead of typing. The fantasy portion of this he enjoys because he says he feels like he's really there. Not here sitting in a room.  Tried to coordinate my thoughts with L, and it was like I got stuck in a venus flytrap. He says he can sense others and hear them but not at the same time. I think that he's right, there are more people here than just he and I. Vision of being at the prom kinda like the flashback in Eclipse where that chick kills her fiance, like we're in the 50's; I just saw a lounge like in an event in a bar or a dinner with a lot of people, it's like a benefit and there are people smoking everywhere. There's pearls everywhere too and it's beautiful. 
/n
/n
He visualized being in the basement of some bar like Inglorious Bastards and could see me sitting there with smoke rolling off my cigarette.
/n
He understands gonzo journalism.
/n
But it's like with the research chemicals we are defining our own generation and they open up the darkest corners of the mind and its inspiring a lot of the time.
/n
/n
He wants to tap a keg right now. Twenty minutes later we actually do tap the keg and we're sitting here trying to figure how to work this freakin keg thing that we got, but honestly, we pour that beer and it's foam but the first taste is incredible. S says it tastes better than it was meant to, and that is absolutely right. It's delicious in a way that is impossible to explain, and you'd be lucky if you could understand it. We're listening to music and he says it's not the same even tho we're both really into this song. I hear my own voice and It's exactly what I should hear. We're sitting on the shoulders of Giants, L says. There's more beats in this song but I know I've heard it a million times without them before. L is controlling pitches and drumbeats with his mind. He can hear whispering lyrics. he can hear movement. he can smell a memory.
/n
/n
S: Ok, so obviously I wrote some of this while I was tripping too, and I have tried both of these substances on different occasions only individually. It is entirely different on both spectrums. I don't really like 6apb because it brings me to a dark  place. I constantly think I'm seeing phantoms and scary faces with huge sharp teeth almost every time I do it. 25i just makes me a little insane, but complete and happy at the same time. I don't have to fear 25i because it makes my fantasies come true. I dressed up like Lady Gaga for my sweetness and actually felt like I was her in some small way, but it was the costume, and I realized that, which I wouldn't have if it had just been 25i. I was getting to the point that dark + insane was the total opposite. I didn't have as much coordination as I would have liked to, but my brain did not stop functioning on the level that I couldn't articulate without having to explain myself more than once. 25i makes me not make sense. I have spouted off the most rediculous things when I'm only on that, dressed like Lady Gaga and actually thought I was her, watched L put that wig and stuff on, and I literally could not recognize him. 6apb makes me not wanna talk at all. It makes me wanna cling to my love and not move the rest of the night. 
/n
/n
Combined, that's a whole 'nother story. Also, I refused to put clothes on and was really sad when I was told that it was necessary for me to not be naked. I was born naked damnit, I shave and I think it's totally fine for me to be naked all the time, but unfortunately that is not possible in this day and age, which is bull shit. 
/n
/n
L: Im writing this the next day in conclusion. I surely had an interesting time after I had stopped typing. Alot of it is a blur but I will try to describe a couple things that I was too overcome at the moment to describe. When S took over the keyboard it was difficult for me to relay the exact things that were blooming in my conciousness. After she took over I tried to describe some of the things I was experiencing. Soon after I stopped typing I started entering a ++++. I start to dip out of real life and my fantasies take over. We are listening to Skrillex and the sheer insanity of his music is being transformed into wildly surreal situations which seem to be memories from other people from the past but sometimes incorporated myself and S. Towards the end I start drinking and then Plug another 75mg of 6apb.
/n
/n
After I started drinking it pretty much turned into a wild fuck session that I feel maybe a little to grapic for readers (Roleplaying exfixiation S&amp;M to be brief.) After that I was pretty much blacked out from the beer &amp; rum but I do remember watching Get Him to the Greek with S and we kept pausing it on the closeup shots of the main characters seeing them seemingly pop off the screen, seeing them angry, sad, surprised, watching them morph into other people and @ one point being completely convinced that there was a demon in the hair of the redhead that bobs her head to the song puff plays after shooting down Aaron (Jonah's) idea.
/n
/n
I eventually fall asleep @ around 8-9 in the morning. We wake up at around 2 and I'm certainly in a haze but not feeling seretonin depletion that I had experienced in my early trials with 6apb. I clean the house and go to a memorial day cookout with S and her daughter and we have a great time even though I realize later that S dosed another 300ug of nbome before we left. It was still fun and peaceful even though it was a family function. As I write this the next day I'm reminded of
/n
the last part of Fear &amp; loathing....
/n
/n
'We're all locked into a survival trip now, That was the fatal flaw in Tim Learys trip. He crashed around America selling consciousness expansion without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him too seriously ... All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours, too. What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped to create ... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody--or at least some force--is tending the Light at the end of the tunnel.
