First I must warn the reader.  This substance is not to get high on as you would on LSD or mushrooms.  If you are looking for a profound religious experience you may what to experiment.

This extract was made like the 'san pedro extaction for dumbies' forgive my spelling.  It is very potent and you need a sitter present.  The trip however is very short, 5-10 min..

The best discription of what happens would be as if you were at groud zero at a nuclear blast.  Many flashs of light as if your are dying and once I thought i actually was 25mg.  Fear is a major part of the trip.

50mg this trip I can only discribe as a near death experience.  I was hyperventalating not knowing it until the end of the trip. I also contacted a few entities looking like dragons or demons, but before I could speak to it the trip ended.

Once more, this should only be used for shaministic voyage.
