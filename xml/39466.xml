I have had several experiences w/ salvia in the past, all of which were mind-boggling &amp; led me to question everything I take for granted about my Self. However, the experience in which I am about to share w/ you is unlike any other.

I was alone in my house. I put on some Miles Davis &amp; rolled a joint of some fair cannabis. This helped to get me relaxed &amp; give me time to contemplate my 'mission', what it is I wish to accomplish. I remind myself to meditate only on that which is eternal. I placed a fairly large hit of the salvia on top of a sliver of cannabis inside my glass water-pipe. 'Here goes nuthin'' crossed my mind, &amp; I flamed the bowl. I took in all of the smoke rather easily. I replaced the bong to the table, sat back, closed my eyes, &amp; blew out the smoke when I could'nt hold it any longer. As the familiar taste/aroma of the leaf flooded my being, I exclaimed 'I remember you!' &amp; what exactly happened after this is not clear to me.

I lost all connection w/ reality &amp; the Self. I 'woke up' in another place. I was seeing thousands &amp; thousands of people running from all directions toward a bright white light in the center. Everyone was laughing hysterically &amp; waving their right arms in the air, as if signaling to the light that 'I am here' or 'don't forget me.' Once I took notice the the people &amp; what they were doing, I heard a familiar voice laughing w/ immense joy &amp; repeating over &amp; over 'They're all running &amp; waving! They're all running &amp; waving!' The voice was my own. I was laughing &amp; saying this, but it was not of my will. My voice seemed to come from a far-off land.

Before long, the objective statement of 'They're all running &amp; waving' turned into the subjective 'We're all running &amp; waving,' &amp; instantly I was caught up in the action of running &amp; waving along w/ everyone else, trying desperately to make it to the light.

At that point, I again heard my own voice in the distance. 'If you go to the light, you'll die. Don't go to the light.'

This invoked an inner sense of panic, &amp; I tried w/ no results to cease my running &amp; save my life. I just kept on 'running &amp; waving' &amp; laughing all of the time, but inside I was manic &amp; unsure of what was going on. I got the sensation that what I was doing was'nt right, that I was'nt supposed to be there yet, &amp; at that moment, I began to feel a vibration along my back &amp; my butt. 'The couch!' All of my senses flooded w/ information from the room I was in. I was back &amp; intact, except the visual aspect of it persisted. Again, I paniced. I knew that I had hit the salvia, &amp; I knew where I was, but my eyes were still watching the other world. 'When will this stop!?' Immediately following this inquisition, my eyes popped open to reveal my living room. I did'nt think to open my eyes, because in my mind, they were already open.

Following the experience, I was extremely energetic in communicating to everyone that I know the importance of what had just been revealed to me. As clueless as I am about what actually occured that day, I know that 'something' happened, &amp; in my mind, it changes everything.</bodytext></report>
