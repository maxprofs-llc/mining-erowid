We'll I'd read a bit about Blue Lotus (what little there was) and decided I'd give it a try. I ordered it from an online vendor and decided to try two preparations and to note their effects.

The first preparation I did was with two tablespoons of the dried plant material in a cup of boiling water, left to sit for 10 minutes and with a teaspoon of sugar added to taste.

I downed the mixture as quickly as I could, though was unable to actually eat the soggy plant material at the bottom of the cup - I tried - but it was just too disgusting. After 20 minutes or so of waiting I noticed a very very mild relaxing effect, but it could have been as much a placebo as anything else. I deemed this first test a failure.

The second test involved loading up a bong with the material that had been previously pulverized in a coffee grinder to almost a powder. I smoked the first cone of the material and noticed a quite pleasant taste to the smoke - also that it was quite easy to smoke. I decided I'd do this properly and quickly loaded up 5 more cones of the material in quick succession smoking them all over the space of about 10 minutes.

Five minutes later I realised I was feeling some effects. I can describe it sort of like a marijuana stone, but not nearly as strong, though it does sort of feel the same. There was a heavy sort of feeling in my head and I felt quite relaxed. Another thing I noticed was a sort of humming or droning in my head, which I have noticed on other occasions using Blue Lotus.

There are none of the really trippy thought patterns you'd expect from marijuana (though your mind does tend to wander), but I did notice one pseudo-psychoactive effect in that I could see detail of close up objects very well. For instance it became quite interesting to look right into the plate of icecream I was eating, I could see all the little details and intricate patterns within it. This was a very mild effect mind you, nothing out of this world, but it was kind of cool. I was unable to notice any effects of the blue lotus 2.5 to 3 hours after ingestion.

The only after effect I got was a head-ache about 2 hours after the smoking test, but I can't fully attribute it to the blue lotus as I often get headaches.</bodytext></report>
