I've tried Blue Lotus many times.

I make tea with around 3 or 4 grams, sometimes while smoking a cigarette of crushed flowers. I boil the plant material 3 times, even if the 3rd time doesnt seem to extract anything.

1 hour after having drunk the tea , I often drink some beer or, more rarely, wine. alcohol is powerfully synergetic with lotus.

I really like the peaceful buzz.

But, sometimes the next day, sometimes later, I feel very depressed and negative. It happens almost every time. I'm really sad for 36 hours, and then I come back to normal again. Depression has a quality of its own which makes that I'm 100% sure that Lotus causes it, or at least plays a part in it.

Also, Blue Lotus gives a particular hangover when a lot of alcohol is drunk at the same time.

Tolerance and addictive potential seem weak.</bodytext></report>
