Ive been a big dexhead since about 2001 when i drank my first bottle of Robitussin. Ive been doing dxm ever since *not heavily*, and have always had very good experiences. Recently however, a good friend of mine scored some AMT, now Ive done AMT before, along with other hallucinogens *LSD, Foxy..*, but he proposes the idea to do both at the same time, I was all for it.

We drove to the local supermarket and picked up 3 bottles of Delsym *time release tussin, it doesnt taste like pure satan either* [Erowid Note: See /n note about Delsym]. We drove back to the house and prepared everything we needed for the night. We started by downing our DXM. I drank a bottle and a half, as well as my friend. We then proceeded to pack our makeshift water bong 3 or 4 times to kick the DXM up a few notches. About 45 to an hour and 15 minutes later I was starting to feel the dex. The double vision came as normal, as did the feeling of dissassociation. My friend then suggested that now would be a good time to eat the AMT. I wanted only a 40mg dosage, where as my friend ate 100mg *NOT SUGGESTED!*. The DXM kicked the AMT in QUICK *normally takes 2 hours to kick in*. The next 20 hours of my life were intense to say the least.

I lay on the couch and felt the AMT start to take effect. The first things I noticed were extreme color distortion and rise in body temperature. About 30 minutes later the walls started to move, not like they do on LSD, but it was almost like they were closing in on me. I lay on the couch as the house seemed as if it were collapsing in on me, feeling like I had shrunk down to the size of a small dog the whole time. I closed my eyes to see what type of CEVs I could conjure up and oh my god were they something. I was floating in a field of endless color and light, the best way to describe it is an evershifting and morphing oil painting, comprised of a bunch splatters of multi-colored paint. A few hours later, my friends girlfriend began to talk to me while I was laying on the couch, asking me what I was experiencing and whatnot. I found this incredibly amusing because the entire time I was talking to her, her entire BODY, face and EVERYTHING, were morphing into completely different people. Some I knew, worked with, some I had never seen, but none the less, it was interesting. At about this point I fell asleep *AMT tires the hell out of me, I always fall asleep*.

That is about all I remember, all and all I would say it was a good trip. I dont recommend anyone mix these two drugs, unless of course they are experienced trippers. AMT is not a very recreational drug, its very intense, use it with extreme caution. Thanks and happy tripping!</bodytext></report>
