One night I was bored so i stopped at a convenience store and bought 2 little packs of 6 mini-thins each. I took 6 on the way home (25 mg each) at about 11:00 and called my friend J to see if he wanted to come over. When he got there i gave him the other 6.

The first feeling I had was that my heart started to beat very fast. I absolutely couldn't sit still and I walked in circles around my house for a few minutes then felt like i suddenly had to sit back down. When i would sit down i felt like my whole body was one big heartbeat and I had to make a very concious effort to breathe. I spent a couple hours leaping up and running around the house followed by laying motionless and then covering myself with a blanket then taking it back off again.

At one point i remember describing it to J as a mild MDMA roll. My eyes were pinging and I felt the need to chew on a straw -but- my eyes ping all the time when I'm tired ever since the first time I tried MDMA.

About 3 hours after i dropped the pills i began to feel nauseous. It was very unpleasant and my heart was pounding so fast and i felt like someone was sitting on my chest. I finally calmed down enough to enjoy what was left of the feeling, which was mostly tingling in my scalp.

I decided to try to go to sleep but I just laid in my bed for several hours rolling around trying to get comfortable. I remember still being awake at about 8am and I -think- I slept for about 30 minutes then i got up and started watching tv. The rest of the day i felt very sluggish but not sleepy at all. I didn't go back to sleep until the next night.

I will probably take ephedrine again but I will only take about half of what i did.</bodytext></report>
