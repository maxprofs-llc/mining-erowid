Heading to school, one too bright and early morning, a friend on my bus offered four pills he always eats six of. So, as a thirteen year old would,  I ate them without a thought.

About an hour an half of hour later when I entered my school walls it hit me. As soon as I got to homeroom, the room was spinning and my stomach turning. I excused my self from the room and went to the bathroom. Here is where I spent the rest of my two classes ralphing up stomach acid. I gradually made my way to the nurse and she insisted I lay down. I was freezing and colvusing until she came and checked on me and called my parents to take me home.
