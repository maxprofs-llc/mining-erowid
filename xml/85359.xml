I am an undergraduate student in my third year now.  I've taken adderall and all sorts of so called 'mind-enhancing' drugs for the past 3 years.  I have never used them regularly; my rate of consumption amounts to little more than twice a semester.  Usually I take adderalls or vyvance for midterms or finals, as well as the occasional test in between.  In my long-term experience, I have found that even though I am tired, after popping an adderall or 2, adding caffeine to the mix is a terrible, terrible idea.  It adds the jitters and nothing more to my state of mind.  The adderall/vyvance causes me to want to do work and study; the caffeine, while it doesn't affect that urge, prevents me from being able to concentrate when I sit down to work because of the jitters.  I get the urge to run around and excercise more than anything.</bodytext></report>
