A friend and I had become very interested in mind exploration and such.  We decided to order some calea from a website, a somewhat risky move.  I got caught up with work and music and things and me and my friend went different ways for the summer.  One day after work I decided that I wanted to try the calea to see if it actually worked.  I smoked a few bowls a few hours before I went to bed, not expecting any results but hoping for mild euphoria.  I felt a little off, I would guess mainly from thinking about it.  I decided it wasn't going to do much for me so I went surfing for a while and listend to music until I fell asleep.

I woke up the next morning feeling fine, maybe a little over tired.  I tried to think back on my dreams, but I couldn't remember any.  I realized that night that throughout the day I was under the impression that the day before I had spent a lot of time in the woods and with a friend who lives far away.  I knew that none of this happend, and I figured out that it was all a dream.  These were by far the most vivid dreams I had ever had.  I recomend Calea to anyone interested.</bodytext></report>
