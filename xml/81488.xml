This was a dumb idea.  150mg was way too much.

Took 2 75mg pills at around 1:30am.  My effects were in line with most amphetamine usage.  I was talking rather quickly, and for some reason awesome at programming embedded C (had to for class the next day).  Strong desire for menthol cigarettes, though I don't generally smoke.

I started speeding pretty hard at about 4am.  Could feel my heart almost jumping out of my chest, shaking vision, heavy breathing, numbness in my hands and arms making it a bit difficult to type.  I would have trouble typing words while talking online, but not normal typos.  I would reverse syllables and odd stuff.  Can't remember that too well.

It kept me up through the night and all the next day, until about 7pm or so when I took a five hour nap.

I have a headache today, but not a horrible one.

Generally, though I absolutely loved it at the time, I wouldn't do it again because, in the piercing light of sobriety, it wasn't worth it.  Haven't done any other versions of amphetamine so I can't compare this time release with anything else.

On a brighter note, my code worked.</bodytext></report>
