Keep in mind that I am pretty experienced in psychedelics having done acid and shrooms many times, but this trip was like no other. I've never had a bad trip either. It was like I was finally introduced to the other side of things.

The night began when my friends came to get with the shrooms. My friend Logan had already eaten about 8 grams. As soon as they picked me up, I shoved the 1/8 in my mouth in anticipation for the night ahead. It was about 4 PM when I first ate them. We then proceeded to drive to another friends house which was about 30 minutes away. We stopped at Taco Bell along the way because the driver was hungry. That's when I first noticed the shrooms kicking in. It was about 20 minutes after I had taken them and I was already getting some visuals. I was starting to have problems talking also, which I have found to be very typical when I trip on anything.

Once we arrived at my friends house, I felt like I was close to my peak. I could barely walk straight and the body buzz I had was very intense. Once inside, I felt very awkward for my friends did not look like they used to. I was having a lot of trouble communicating with them and felt weird. The longer I was in the situation the worse I felt. I had to get out of there, and I think my friend Logan felt the same way. Once we left, I had felt a lot better. We were now on our way to Logans house. This is where my trip took a very unexpected turn.

We went out to Logans truck and were smoking some hash in his driveway when I started to feel the most intense shroom waves I have ever felt. It almost felt like I was passing out. I had to step out of the truck for a second and try to recollect myself. I kept reminding myself that I had eaten shrooms in hopes of not freaking out. I entered the truck again only to have the same rushes again. That's when I noticed a neighbor of Logans walking a dog down the street with a flashlight. It was about 6:30PM and it was already dark. For some reason I got this very strange rush of paranoia and I didn't like it one bit. The way she was moving the flashlight started to freak me out. It moved in the most erratic ways. This led to me to question if what I was seeing was real or not. We sat there and watched her walk all the way down the street until we couldn't see her anymore.

This is when I started to have my bad trip. Once again, these rushes the mushrooms were giving me made me feel like I was passing out and waking up. I tried to explain this to my friend Logan and he did his best to try and calm me down. All events following this point were completely insane, as if I were going crazy. I looked over at my friend and he had the strangest smile on his face. He then reached over to the CD player that was playing some 311, and took the CD out and flipped it in between each finger and placed it back in. The whole time he did this the music never stopped. I was then almost being overwhelmed by these rushes.

Death was the first thing that popped up in my head. I thought for sure my time was up. My mind wouldn't stop racing with these crazy thoughts. I then jumped out of the truck and started pacing. Logan got out of the truck and kept repeating 'You're trippin' man, you're just trippin.' This, for some reason made me feel even worse. I kept pacing back and forth feeling like I was goin to burst out into tears. I couldn't understand anything and I couldn't remember anything. I kept asking for my friend to take me to the hospital, but being the good friend he is, he wouldn't (Thank God). All of the sudden my friends phone starts ringing. He looked at me and said it was Joe. I think Joe was calling him all night trying to get some pot. He would then hand me the phone and say 'Here, it's Joe.' I took the phone and tried to place it to my ear, but there was no phone in my hand. Then I would hear the phone ring again. He would lift it up to his ear and spit out a bunch of gibberish and then try to hand it to me again. I would take it only to find my hand empty again.

Now I realized things were definitely not right. It seemed like I was pacing for hours trying to figure out what was going on and wondering if I was going to die or not. Logan got me in his garage somehow. I pleaded with him to let me go and talk to his mom. I needed any type of comfort at this point. He wouldn't let me however. He then asked me if I needed anything and I noticed how dry my mouth was so I blurted out for him to get me a pop. Once I got it, I opened it up and took a big sip. By this time Logan had called one of our good friends Chris and he was on his way to come and get us and try to calm me down. I was still pacing and talking non sense about death though.

That's when I walked back into the garage and opened the same can of pop again and took a drink. I was completely confused because it's impossible to open a can of pop twice. That's when I went back outside and opened the can for a third time. My fragile mind was devastated by this. I felt like I wanted to scream but I couldn't. Then Logan, in another attempt to calm me down, took me to his truck and put in some 311. He told me Close your eyes and unravel your path.' He says he doesn't remember telling me this, but I do. Thats when 'Homebrew' by 311 came on, which is a song about acid. I remember closing my eyes and seeing the brightest patterns I had ever seen. They flowed so well with the music. I remember dancing and singing in his front seat for this was the best music I had ever heard. This was the first time in the night I had felt myself calming down.

Then I noticed that my pants were soaked and I was freezing. I had put that can of pop in my pocket for some reason and it spilt when we got into the truck. I felt horrible about the whole deal. Then my stomach started getting these cramps. They were the worst cramps I have ever endured. I felt like I needed to puke but I tried and tried and couldn't. Finally Chris showed up and all I could do was give him the biggest hug. It was a huge relief that he was here to get me. Then we got into his car and left. I can't remember where all we went, but we did a lot of driving before we finally got to his house. I remember saying I was going to puke so he exclaimed 'LUNCH BOX!' He handed it to me and I tried to puke several times but still couldn't. Chris told me to keep making puking noises because I WAS puking. I didn't really understand what he meant. I took it as I was puking every where but I couldnt see it.

When we got to Chris' house, I looked down at my phone. Time was 6:47 PM. All of this had happened within a span of about 20 minutes according to my phone. We went into Chris' house and I tried to smoke some weed but couldn't. I could tell they couldn't understand anything I was saying as I think I was trying to spit out sentences to the best of my ability and failing horribly. That's when I began to hear Chris and Logans voices constantly. I remember hearing the most spontaneous things I've ever heard. Logan was still telling me that Joe was on the phone and he would at times make puking noise like 'BLUH' over and over again. I could also hear Chris screaming 'LUNCH BOX! LUNCH BOX!' I remember I kept looking down at my phone and it was still 6:47 to my amazement.

I then went and tried to puke in Chris' bathroom. While I was in there Chris and Logan proceeded to talk to me about everything. Whenever I was puking they would say things like 'There you go it's about time you started feeling better.' But whenever I said I thought I was done puking, they would go back into making puking noises and yelling lunch box and other spontaneous non sense. I think this was my brain trying to get all of the poison of my system. I felt like I was fading in and out of reality this whole time at Chris. Then I began to puke violently. Lots of pink and orange gush spilled all over me and Chris' bathroom. Then it all disappeared and I felt so much better on the inside.

I looked at my phone again and it was still 6:47. Why wasn't time moving? I felt like I was in the past trying to catch up to the future where Chris and Logan were. I went out and sat on the couch to watch some TV now that I felt better but still very confused. Chris and Logan however weren't there, but for some reason I didn't care. I remember looking at the TV and seeing tanks and people with machine guns. None of the sounds matched up however. I would see a gun being fired and hear a jet or something. Then Sex and the city came on. I again noticed how the sound was off again. They would talk and their lips didn't match with their words. I also remember seeing the volume display going up and down on the TV constantly. I was still at a loss for words and I was starting to have stomach cramps again, but I was able to control them now.

I decided to look at my phone again and noticed that it was about 1:05 am and I was wondering how time went by so fast. By now my trip was over. I still felt a little weird, but I was now able to talk to people. Logan and Chris who were now seated on the couch next to me just stared at me and asked if I was alright. They told me I was talking to myself the whole night and they didn't understand a thing I was talking about. There were a lot of bits and pieces I still can't recall.

I've never had an experience like this one. I've tripped several times and have never hallucinated like I did that night. I'm still trying to figure out how I got into this state of mind. It's almost like I was in a different world. Like my brain created all of my surroundings to help me through the confusion to the best of its ability at that time. I wish I had more answers but I never will. As for me eating mushrooms again, I have eaten them twice more and nothing of this sort happened. As scary as this experience was, I'd like to do it again and hopefully get some answers.</bodytext></report>
