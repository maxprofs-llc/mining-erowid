Two nights ago while sitting in a local fast-food restauraunt, discussing our lives and various stray topics, a lady friend of mine told me that she had tried Nitrous Oxide for the first time the night before.   The first thing she recommended was that I tried it at least once.  I agreed and we traveled to the local porn palace which is known to distribute packs of 24.  We weaved through aisles displaying videos for those with anal and goat fetishes and finally arrived at the main counter.  After splitting the cost of a pack, ten bucks each, we drove to a park near my house and found a dark corner to stop the car.

Keeping an eye out for any black and whites prowling the neighborhood, we busted out the shit.  She was the first to partake, in order to show me the proper method.  Never before have I witnessed a female having an orgasm without any form of sexual contactuntil that moment when (lets call her Nozzie.)  Nozzie inhaled a balloon-full of N2O.  After dropping the balloon, she leaned back her seat and began moaning.  Her back arched as her eyes closed and lips parted.   As her breasts reached toward the night sky, Nozzies head moved from side to side as purring, quaking whispers softly poured from her throat.   After about thirty seconds passed, she lay back in her seat, sighed, and smiled contently.

Needless to say, at that moment, I wanted nothing more than to breathe pure Nitrous Oxide into my lungs.

 So I did.  Being the nervous N2O virgin that I was, my first inhalation wasnt as spectacular as I had expected.  Although I did experience mild sound distortion and a sense of complete bodily relaxation, it didnt have the same power upon me as it seemed to have had upon Nozzie.  I was disappointed as hell.

But Nozzie (the sweet, empathetic person that she is) had the perfect cure for that:  she told me to close my eyes and wait a few minutes.  When I opened them, she had a new balloon prepared for mea double dosage of N2O.  I thanked her and prepared myselfexhaling completely, I cleared my lungs of all oxygen.   Inhaling completely, I filled them with the cool, sweet gas and continued the pattern of inhalation/exhalation into the pink punching balloon.   After four repetitions, I began to feel the night close around me.   Enjoying the sudden onrush of sensory distortion and closing my eyes, I continued to breathe from the balloon.  Suddenly appearing behind my eyelids was a white mass, strands and patterns of greenish purple dancing throughout.  I felt all physical sensations dissapear as I became something else, something divine, something that could SEE reality for what it was.  While, in truth, the orgasm of the N2O high lasted for a grand total of 10 seconds, it felt as though time meant nothing and that I was on a journey through forever.

When the cerebral pleasure had subsided, I realized to my dismay that I was merely a human being, that I wasnt swimming through the river-streets of some undiscovered city in the heavens.   I also realized that, although Ive smoked massive quantities of grass before, I had never in my life been this high.  It was the most magical state of mind that I have ever reached.

For the next round, she and I decided to enjoy a simultaneous experience.  We both agreed that a double-dose would be perfect.   Before inhaling, I put one of my favorite new cds in the player: A Perfect Circles Mer de Noms.  (which I highly recommend.  This band is fucking amazing.  If youre a fan of Tool or just a fan of note-for-note vocals and true beauty, you must hear this album.)  I played the song Orestes and we prepared ourselves for the next round.

As the world disappeared, the vocals of Maynard James Keenan and the atmosphere of the music pressed me into a void where the music acted as a soundtrack to a land of perfection.   While there, I felt nothing but content.  As the most potent effects wore off, the intensity of Orestes increased, creating a perfect balance for the situation.   I stared at the carpeted inner-roof of my car and enjoyed the beauty of the moment as Nozzies N2O orgasm reached its crescendo.

What happened next will go down in the annals of my life.

As the song continued, a lyric that perfectly represented the situation was sung by Maynard:  One more medicated peaceful moment.   So so so true.  Breathing in a toxic gas that we bought at a XXX video store, this girl Nozzie and I had together discovered a sense of peace that we had never felt before.  When I told her this, she merely sighed and emitted a final groan.  In the state of transcendental realization that I was feeling, the beauty that lay beside me in the dark car seemed beyond what was real.  To see if she truly existed, I moved to kiss her lips.   
/n

It was passion at its fullest.  Our first kiss, our first taste of each others life.   Amazing.
/n

   Feverishly, we filled the balloons again, another double.  Inhaled, exhaled.   Kissed.   Only one part of me felt her lips and tongue against mine, the physicality of me.  My spirit body felt pure, burning, molten human flesh coursing down my throat and throughout my veins.   Her breath became my breath, her flesh my flesh, and her soul my soul.

   Ten minutes later, we lay on the cool grass in the center of the park with our limbs intertwined.   Our eyes stared into the black sky and its burning white embers, our humanity slowly returning to us but our minds never to be the same.</bodytext></report>
