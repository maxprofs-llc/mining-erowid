I have a herniated disk with 2 pinched nerves/possibly three. I was given by my doctor Naproxen (l 500 mg TEVA-Naproxen EC twice daily) and also Cyclobenzaprine (1 three times daily as needed) as a muscle relaxant. I took it for a very short time as it made me feel like crap.  I could only take the two together at bedtime as I could not function on both of them.

I took both to avoid pain while in a test situation and even though it was open-book, I was completely lost. Impossible to concentrate and focus on work. One must take with food but I won't take both together unless I am going to sleep. I only want to sleep when I do both together and it ruined my day when I needed to do something other than sleep...</bodytext></report>
