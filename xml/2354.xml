        I did some ecstasy on Saturday. I got it from a guy I work with.
/n
It was a nice surprise! I bought a 'Full Moon,' or what was supposed to be
/n
two doses. I'd gotten MDMA a few times in '89 and '90, but it wasn't that
/n
strong... of course that was $8-10 and the Full Moon cost me $30. It was a
/n
white powder, like the other stuff I'd had, in a clear gelcap.
/n
/n
        A major snowstorm was predicted Saturday night, so I waited until
/n
it started snowing then took the whole thing, at around midnight. It hit
/n
me real slowly, and in about 1 to 1 1/2 hours I peaked. I spent an hour or
/n
two curled up on the floor just thinking. I couldn't keep my eyes open
/n
because the natural beauty and beingness of everything was just too
/n
intense. The most mundane objects took on a new light, things were
/n
beautiful simply by being what they were. A totally different experience
/n
from LSD, mundanely beautiful rather than cosmically and intensely
/n
profound. It was very insightful in a simplistic way. I went out in the
/n
snow that had built up to about 5 inches by then. The beauty of everything
/n
in virgin snow with big fluffy flakes falling heavily... I can't describe
/n
it. Heavenly. I finally fell asleep around 6. I awoke to a world changed
/n
by snow and a self changed by ecstasy. Its left me with a sense of
/n
purpose, renewal, and focus on the now.</bodytext></report>
