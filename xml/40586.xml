I would first like to note that until I found this web-page in a google site about mushrooms, I refused to try any sort of psychedelic drugs. I began to read about the mushrooms and how they affect your body. Just before I exited the site I saw a link that said 'Mushrooms and Migraines.'

Unfortunately I began having migraines when I was six. They stopped, and now I am 19 and experiencing them worse than before. I let my boyfriend convince me to take the mushrooms to help take care of my migraines.

First I took 2 grams of mushrooms and chopped them up finely and boiled them in one cup of water for fifteen minutes. I drained them with a coffee filter and into a cup. I drank that first cup and boiled the mushrooms for fifteen more minutes in another cup of water, followed by the straining method once more. I drank this second cup and left the rest of the mushrooms in cup of water for two hours.

I waited a half an hour and began tripping. This was an absolutely wonderful experience, I believe the trip with the mushroom tea is most definitely the way to go. Even for a person who just wants a good trip. I tripped so sweetly, and I was able to watch the walls and the floors melt while I watched a Color show on an Apple Computer. This was amazing.

After four hours my trip began to dissipate, and this is where I messed up. Instead of making more tea, I just ate another two grams and waited for the effects. For someone with migraines, this doesn't help.

I went about a month or so with no migraines, just a cloudy headache instead. Soon after I began to have migraines daily, disabling me. I got fired from my job and I am still looking. I am also a college student and am unable to attend a lot of my classes due to these daily migraines.

I believe that if I had not eaten the second dose I would not have regained the migraines so badly. I am hoping to try it again someday to get rid of these migraines, but for now I am going to see a nuerologist to see what they can do for me.

Thanks Erowid for the idea and the directions on how to get rid of my migraines, even if it was only for a little while.</bodytext></report>
