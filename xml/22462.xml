My boyfriend and I had decided to try this relatively 'new' drug, AMT. Before jumping into it we wanted to be certain that it would be worth the risk. We checked out numerous sources, for any information pertaining to chemical interactions while using AMT. I take Lithium as an antidepressant, and it was not listed as a negative interactant. We had the whole house to ourselves and we decided that this would be a good time to try AMT. We were told that the onset takes about 2 hours, and not to take any extra AMT and that it would hit us in time. I was an unexperienced tripper, so I really did not know what to expect, but I trusted that I would be ok, since my boyfriend had alot of experience. Well we both took a 15 mg cap of AMT to begin. After the first hour I started to see minor visuals, to me they seemed a bit scary, but nothing that I could not handle. Then we went upstairs and somehow about an hour later I decided to take another 15 mg cap, because my 'trip' was pretty minor, and the onset time had passed.

This was the worst mistake I could have made, due to the fact that I was on Lithium. Well, my boyfriend took another one too, just to be on the same page as me. After about another hour and a half is where I lost track of time and reality. I was on the bathroom floor in the corner shaking and feeling the walls and floor rippling, even the air, it was sort of like a water bed effect. I was enjoying it at first, but then it became too intense. The rainbow vision was gone and to replace the good feelings were evil demons, thats the only way I can describe it. People grabbing at me from all directions screaming in my ears whispering things like, 'You are going to die.'

I was screaming and crying and clawing at things. I could not stand up. My boyfriend carried me into a bedroom and set me down on the bed. At this point even he looked evil, his face completely distorted. His words all came out evil and menacing. Then there were three second bouts of sanity, where I actually knew what was going on and I knew that I needed help, this was more than a bad trip. He kept telling me that it was a bad trip. He brought me milk and I wouldn't drink it. He tried to give me something to calm me down and i kicked him. I told him repeatedly to 'call the cops' take me to the hospital...MAKE THEM STOP!!!

Then after what felt like eternity, I threatened to kill myself just to get away from the insanity....I felt if I stayed this way much longer it would be like this forever, and I would lose it even more, if that was possible. I lived all my worst fears that night. Then I had alot of trouble breathing, I felt as if I was suffocating. Finally he took me down the stairs....I thought he was trying to push me, so I fought him. Then he told me he was going to drive me to the hospital and I freaked out, because I thought he was going through the same madness as me. I later found out that he had everything under control, not like me. Well once downstairs I was trying to open the door. I couldn't remember how to open it. I thought there was help on the other side and we would die like this. Then I saw blood on my hands, I thought I was hurting myself unintentionally, just like all the horror stories I hear... There was no blood, it was in my head. Thats all I remember from there. He had taken me to my car and was driving me to the hospital, when I turned blue, from not breathing. He pulled over at a gas station and called 911. The police came with an ambulance. He had to go through hell with the cops, but it was not as bad as we thought it would be. He did call them, after all.

The EMT's took me to the hospital, tested me for every drug imagineable, hooked up an iv....took blood stuck me with shit...I guess I was fighting them at first because they had me tied down with restraints when I woke up....I had a catheter in my bladder and oxygen tubes in my nose (it still didnt feel like enough air) and more tubes in my arms...I woke up all doped up and with my guardian and a cop there. The cop was pretty callous, considering what I had been through, I was in no condition for a lecture. He told me that I almost died and that he didnt give a shit basically, because it was just a morgue report to him or an overdose report. I didn't have the strength or the mind power to respond. My car was impounded, because it was left at the gas station, the hospital bill was huge, and on top of it all I could be permafried or 6 feet under right now. I did not do justice to my experience, and I don't think anyone will know how terrible it was until they have experienced that, but I would never wish that on anyone. Just don't be too lax with this drug if you ever decide to take it. I would not recommend it at all, but if you must, then please refrain from taking any perscription or OTC drugs before doing this, and for perscription drugs wait about 2 weeks, just to be safe....it's your life, don't be stupid.</bodytext></report>
