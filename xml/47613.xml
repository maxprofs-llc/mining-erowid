Always respectful of powerful substances, I had last used X when it hit LA and my town Austin, TX as a legal item, and it turned those final few but memorable college parties in '85 into synergistic and intense times lasting hours, among people who became part of a carefree and caring mix of old and new faces, all young and beautiful it seemed - we did not want a Woodstock, but it is imprinted forever upon our last weeks before the 'real world' hit. Those times when former drunken co-eds became angels of confidence, when former concerns of 'hooking up' were gone and anyone could end up wherever they wanted before the sun came up, smiling and certain all night, that all was right. Pre-rave, pre-Schedule I, just good. First times are always best w/ any drug, so 1/2 tab could be true X bliss within 30 minutes, w/ geographic visuals and trails of lights, feelings shared w/abandon, walks in nature pure beauty, shared in perfect symmetry w/fellow voyagers.

But times changed, X was often something else than MDMA, and a harsher comedown was the rumor, so I counted my blessings for the fun we had and moved on.  But I learned enough to know that one day, if the stars aligned, I might seek a way to find another memorable altered state of perfection again. And so I'll share exactly how that did happen 5 years ago, after meeting someone who trusted me and liked the idea too.  Much planning and preparation went into it.  I spent 4 or 5 months cultivating my own mushrooms after a friend shared his methods, so I knew I had the cleanest and best quality because of my efforts, ending up with lots of big fresh ones in perfect shape, some of which I dried and weighed to get the first part of the mix, a good g. of my own sun-dried shroom for each of us.  I also acquired the latest kit to test and ensure the x capsules I acquired, and I highly recommend this type of kit, as over 50% failed, and I walked away often letting others know what they really had - if they cared - but often it would be some form of speed/amph or simply a nice little pressed placebo w/an emblem on it.

But finally I found capsule content, a minute amount of which practically fizzed and jumped off the plate, pure as MDMA could be. I weighed capsule contents at 100mg each, and by then we knew one apiece should equal 3 hours of xfx, along w/OJ, water, and a couple of 5HTP supplements for each of us along the way, then one more tab to split would be there since we knew we likely had 6 hours of shroom time, and the idea was timing to hit that nirvana.

T+0 We ate the nice clean shrooms, chewed them up and all, and they taste fine.
/n

T+30min 1/4 capsule X under the toungue - unmistakable taste at that point (sublingual absorption) for each of us, and popped the rested with some OJ and a 5HTP supplement.  This was just right, as the shrooms on top of just a little food taken T-30 or so started their fx by T+1H, and we found the sublingual X really began nicely at T+45min with some trailing colors (sunset just beginning), and within 45 minutes we were rolling with the homies.

And how!  These two together, timed right for this first hour, did what I had only ever imagined could really work, they cancelled out the sometimes negative effects of the other.  The mushrooms had none of the occasional initial stomach jitters, and none of what I had often felt was a heavy, yawning sensation that made them a much less sociable, and definitely less ambulatory experience, the so-called body load.  The X had none of the potential negatives either: no jaw clenching, no headaches, no sweating like pigs!

Sometimes intense pleasures were there and enhanced, but there is no denying the geo patterns we both saw in unison, perhaps the power of the human mind finding a soulmate, mutual suggestion and it will be, but well into a state of 'watching our show' together, feeling our hearts beat in sync, never afraid or paranoid.  Eyes open, candles and stars were symmetrical while at the same time the rounder, natural sense of our surroundings breathing with us, like shrooms lite plus total ability to run, walk, dance, or just look into each others' eyes.  We liked The Wall when we saw it, but no jarring imagery was part of this night, and we were leading the orchestra of sights and sounds, never losing touch, never wanting to do so.

Laying back on the soft ground, looking at stars that we felt happy to know were ships in space, heading at us in 3 or 4 dimensions and many colors, or maybe airplanes.  We were glad they were not afraid to come within inches of our bodies.  Closing our eyes, we softly described to each other the unique but mutual visions of color and the music we could still hear for whatever reason, a fusion of sounds the CD called TripHop or some such thing, with eklectic instruments, some syntesized, some of a tribal exotic nature.  This was not the brain-frying experience we both never wanted to have, it was what we desired, at times rolling in waves of intensity, at times calm and peaceful, like when the ground began swaying us in the breeze as if the perfect hammock, well off the groung, floating, but again, always ready to be fully aware and even ready to speak with others had they been around.

T+2.5H:  We split the last x capsule, and swallowed with more OJ.
/n
/n
T+3? T+3:30?  Peak I would say, but then really all was waving, rolling, keeping us thoughout what seemed like the perfect duration.
/n

T+6: Relaxing more and more, OJ or water throughout and a final 5HTP capsule for each of us.  This really based on my reading, and I must say there was none of the 'comedown' I recalled from some prior times those years ago, all just leading to a gradual desire for sleep, which came sometime around T+8H or 4am.

We awoke mid-day feeling some of those 'old school' type feelings of still being somewhat under our spell, sort of sleepy, but by that evening fine as usual, so I would say our approach and this combo cut off that wasted day of feeling 'blue', and I have seen friends re-dose on x once or even twice, and I can say for us, 50% more at T+3H or so could not have been improved upon, most likely just would have led to a hangover, and/or dehydration.

We both agreed, and still do, that recreational use of anything again will be unlikely anytime soon, as it would be difficult to imagine improving on this experience.  Not suggesting that this is right for everyone or anyone in particular, but being 'away from the rave/crowd' was just perfect that night, and the enhancements we added gave us a memorable night.  Will I suggest such to my kids one day?  Unlikely, of course.  But I share here just because it's never been told, and speaks to 'moderation' in many ways, and the care to be absolutely sure of what you might ingest or otherwise add to your party.  Since then, I can say we've had many great times, and they've been with nothing more than good company, a nice dinner, but without controlled substances. So enjoy each day, and I hope this has been of some interest.</bodytext></report>
