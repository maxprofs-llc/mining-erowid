Okay, a friend of mine got ahold of these tye-dyed colored pills and told me they were ecstasy. These pills match the unnamed tye dye colored pills on the ecstasy data site, which have mCPP in them. Of course I read up as much as I could before even thinking of getting them, but theres like virtually no info on them. From what I read, people use piperazines as alternatives to meth and E. I read the few reports on TFMPP and BZP. Sounded good to me, so I got 10 of them. Me and my girl dosed 1 pill each at around 7 pm. We smoked a fat blunt and waited for the effects to kick in. It hit me slowly, felt kinda like I was rolling. But nothing major happened for like 3 hours. Me and her were pretty well lit and we decided to go to the mall. We got lost at least 5 times inside this mall, and its really not that big, and I had been there a million times. We decided this was too many people to be around so we left. We drove back towards her house and chilled at a park. /n

I wasnt really feeling all that great at this point, maybe 2 hours into the experience. My stomach felt like I drank a whole lot of robutussin. We took a walk and cooled down, then went to her house. This is when shit started to hit the fan. We were sitting on her bed playing with her dogs, and I decided to lay down and close my eyes. This was no good! All I could see all around me were thousands of cop cars flying towards me with their lights flashing. Then the cars turned into xanax pills and they were driving around. I had to open my eyes because it was all too real. Then at maybe 1030-11pm, her dad tells me I gotta go because everyone has to work in the morning. I live an hour away from my girl, so I was freakin out... I called my friend who got me the pills and asked if I could crash at his house, luckly he said ok. So I feel like shit now, starting to trip hard, and then when I walked out to my car, I dont know why, but I popped another one. 5 minutes later I stumble into my friends house. I can barely walk, talk do anything.

This is when it got really weird. We started watching movies, scary movies. Bad idea! It was really fucked up, because every girl in one movie started to look exactly like my girl. And these girls are getting stabbed and there throats slit and all kinds of shit. My brain was so wacked up that I thought I had actually killed my girl, I felt so bad, i was so worried about her, because she had taken one more pill too I found out. She called me from her house and was having a great time, she was tripping balls seeing all kinds of shit. I was just sittin there, and my friends room turned into some crazy shit. All the walls had patterns on them and the patterns were moving and growing, then they turned rainbow colored, and started glowing, and the glow was shooting out of everything moving around like smoke. I was thinking the whole time, 'this is so cheesy, like somebody tried to make some acid and added the wrong ingredients. It was so fake.' I could not calm down. My friend packed a fat bowl of good nuggets and we smoked like 2. This was the only thing that calmed me down. Then he put in 'Van Helsing'. This was horrible. Theres these flying angels, and they looked just like my girl... they look all pretty one minute, the next they turn into demons and ohh god i just couldnt watch.

By now its like 4 am and i just stared peaking. everytime I thought i was gonna come down it just kicked in harder. I couldnt get up because of the snakes and hills everywhere. I looked at the pile of weed on the cd case and it turned into little dancing mushrooms, then they turned into thousands of little tiny people, and they were rioting and killing each other. It just kept getting more intense. I was sitting there, watching the tv, and my friend was on his bed laying down. I could see him from the corner of my eye. But at the same time i was sure I saw him on the bed, his door opened up on the complete opposite side of the room and he walked in. What the fuck? How did he do that? This is too much. It can stop whenever it wants to... please stop. Nothing, it just hit harder. By now I am sitting there twitching, like having little mini seizures and shit. I thought I was od'ing. Just wait it out I told myself. its only a drug. I have taken 20 hits of real good acid, but acid has nothin on this shit. Anyway, it was pretty uneventful for the next 15 hours, I couldnt sleep, felt like i had to puke, thought I was never gonna stop tripping and I was scared. I tripped a full 38 hours straight, non stop. I still see shit like 4 days later.

I'm sober, and it feels so good. I dont even want to drink beer or smoke weed anymore. This trip would have been really cool, but it just made me feel so nasty inside, like I was gonna crawl out of my skin. My girl loved it, she said its her new favorite thing. She took 2 more 2 days after, waited 4 hours, tripped for 5 minutes, and that was it. I loved acid and shrooms, but this sure as hell is no substitute. This report doesnt do my trip justice, I cant even describe this shit. Its like nasa went to mars and brought back alien drugs. wow... be careful yall.</bodytext></report>
