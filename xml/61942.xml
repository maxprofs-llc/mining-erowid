A little background on my experience with drugs, I used pot a lot when younger and I still go to Canada once in a while for 222s , when I had teeth pulled or got a  few hydrocodones, I enjoyed that.  Now, I got some Ultrams for my foot problem and . Ultram is between codeine and hydrocone, but trams do last longer than both, but Ultram takes longer to peak effect than either.

Feel good, like I could put my weight on my feet without a care, just forgot about the problem. Grab a beer, and listen to some music, my mood is really good, notice the sunny day looks great, relaxed but at the same time, I can get things done without any dizziness.
