Adderall is one of my favorite utilitarian drugs. I take it about once every couple of months when I have a big project to finish, an entire house to clean, tons of art to make or an event to plan. It gives me a focus and drive that is usually lacking due to everyday life stuff, like lack of sleep or stress. When I take Adderall at night, I can stay up without feeling out of it and exhausted the next day. Also, because I use it so infrequently, I get these effects from a normal dose, 20mg or even 10mg. I have read many reports of bad experiences with overdosing on Adderall. Too much of this stuff throws my brain out of whack. I work with teenage methamphetamine addicts and I've seen them abuse prescription drugs in just the same way as crystal meth.

Personally, Adderall is like a little saviour for me when I need a boost. It gives me a lot of initiative to begin big tasks and for me, beginning is always the hardest part. I always take it orally now because I used to snort it and I experienced a really dry, scratchy throat and nose for a week following. It wasn't worth it.
