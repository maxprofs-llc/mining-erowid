I took qty (8) 250 mg Phenibut capsules equaling 2grams that I acquired from a trusted online vendor. Never experimenting with them before I was exciting to see if they lived up to what Ive read online. I was curious how they would mix with barbiturates. I searched and searched and could not find barely any information online. I acquired a xanax bar and snorted half the bar and chewed the other half. I also take topamax for migraine headaches (100mg daily).

This combination is a BAD IDEA!!  It was like I had taken a massive dose of GHB. I slept throughout the night from the xanax, which was good, however the whole next day I could not walk, talk, anything. Ive taken xanax bars before and been fine, especially the next day. Still 48 hours later I am in a stupor. My actions are slowed and the side effects that I live with daily from the topamax where quadruplified. The pins and needle feeling topamax gives me while on Phenibut/Xanax combo covered my whole body. I feel physically and emotionally numb and my body is sluggish and drained. If I would have tried this experiment in public I could have been date raped or ended up dead somewhere. DO NOT MIX Phenibut with Xanax!!!!!</bodytext></report>
