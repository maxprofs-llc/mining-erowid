I am a 52 year old male in Vancouver, BC. I suffered from periodic severe cluster headaches for almost 30 years. They would recur about every 2-3 years for a 2-4 month period, in 1-2 hour 'drop me to my knees' headaches occurring 4-6 times daily. I nicknamed them 'suicide headaches', and could not work or function normally during the clusters. I used dihydroergotamine (Migran), sumatriptan (Imitrex), and large amounts of ibuprofen or acetominafen in attempts to control the pain with little success. In desperation I finally targeted my diet and for one year stopped eating all meat, dairy products, chocolate, sugar, all sweets and soft drinks, and avoided prepared foods and restaurant food. I lived for that year on only beans, rice, tofu, canned sardines, canned tuna, canned salmon, granola with soy milk, fresh (raw) vegetables and fruit, and multigrain breads.

That was six years ago. I have had absolutly NO recurrence of the headaches in that time, other than a brief 1 minute 'flash' of the type of pain associated with cluster headaches, caused by ONE bite of chocolate 4 years ago. I have noticed a migraine 'aura' about 4 times in six years but no pain. I consider myself self-cured and have little faith in the medical profession or the pharmaceutical industry. I have slowly and carefully added things to my diet but it is still centered around the things I lived on for that year. I believe that cluster headaches and migraines are an 'environmental' disease caused by poisoning from eating things that only 'look' like food, but are not food. I have no evidence that what worked for me will work for anyone else.

I have used LSD, magic mushrooms, and peyote numerous times in my life. I am a moderate smoker, and have perhaps three of four alcoholic drinks per year (usually scotch). None of this had any immediate positive or negative effect on the clusters.

I think though, that the heightened awareness produced by psychedelics was helpful in giving me enough awareness of what I do (knowingly or unknowingly) to myself to give me enough clues to what I can change, and it may be that the psychedelics I've used in the past were, in that sense, what cured my clusters.</bodytext></report>
