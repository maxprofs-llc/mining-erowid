I have been using this stuff prescribed to me for about 6 months. I am prescribed to 20mg nightly, which used to knock me right the hell out. It became a bit weak and less pronounced in its effects orally, so I would snort my dose telling myself it was the same amount and there was no problem...big mistake!

Every time I get a new script at the end of the month, I will crush up 3 to 4 at a time, because I'd gone without for 3 weeks. Then when the normal tolerance kicks in, I blow between 60 and 80mgs in a sitting. The feeling does not numb all of the anger I'm feeling at the time, but rather allows me to dull the pain that accompanies it and puts me in a very sedated state, where being a stress head and going gray at 18 is appealing to me.

After all these months of cycling on and off the drug at such high dosages I've completely fried my memory, long and short term. The feeling is absolutely unforgettable, making everything visually more opaque and settling. It gives such a distinct mellow stoned feeling that it cannot be compared to any other substance.</bodytext></report>
