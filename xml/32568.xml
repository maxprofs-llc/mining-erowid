For about 3 months prior to my first experience I had wanted to try shrooms very much. I had heard really great stories about them. Where I'm from however shrooms are really hard to come by, and my first experience was back when I didn't have very many hookups like I do now. There had to be at least 8 times where I was told that I would be able to get shrooms, and then the plans fell through. However on a Friday night my friend gave me a call telling me that he had chocolates and that he could sell me one with an eigth in it for $35 which I immediately drove out to get. As I locked the door to my room I took out the Hershey kiss shaped tin foil that had smiley face stickers all around it.

I decided to wait until approximately 11:00pm before I would ingest half of the chocolate, which I did. I know everyone recommends being with friends the first time you trip, but I really felt I could handle it, which I could until I made a stupid mistake later on. I knew with it being my first time, and me ingesting only half of the chocolate that it would take some time before the effects would begin. After an hour I assumed that the effects were about ready to begin, but after another 30 minutes I began to worry. After about 1 hour and 45 minutes I started feeling some of the effects. Things in my peripheral vision began to grow and shrink. I really liked what was beginning to happen, so I immediately ingested the other half of my chocolate. I then laid on my bed, to wait.

Staring up at my ceiling, all of the hard corners had smoothed out so it looked like I was in a moon walk. As I breathed, my entire room breathed with me, expanding and contracting. It was very cool looking. After both half's of the chocolates kicked in, I had the right to say that I was officially 'trippin my balls off.' The whole world was essentially melting. Everything around me was melting, growing, shrinking, waving, turning, and tilting and I couldn't stop any of it. I laughed at nearly everything around me. I decided to look at this electricity tube I have in my room, and it was so absolutely incredible that I fell to the floor laughing.

On the carpet I realized that I started melting into the carpet. I couldn't define my body, but I knew that my body had become the floor and my essence was in the floor. Awaking from my daze I got up and staggered to this huge cushiony chair I have in my room and draped myself over it. Moving my hand across it, I began to melt into this also. Once again I could not find myself and assumed that I was part of the chair. Everything was amazing. My friend called my cell phone and as I began to talk to him, I could not find my mouth. I was talking into the phone, but I didn't know how and I thought my mouth was speaking from the other corner of the room.

After hanging up, I started playing with my hands, touching them together. My skin essentially melted into each other, it was a very odd sight. I then decided to go on the computer to find some trippy sites. I could not make out any of the letters on the keyboard, they looked like squiggles, and all of the keys were literally switching places. Somehow I got to a site, and stared at this awesome picture of a spirit with all of these eyes around him. I turned on some Pink Floyd and the picture started moving to the music. The eyes started rotating, it looked like they were dancing. I then got up, and decided to take a walk outside, since my parents were asleep. I saw my keys on the floor, but decided that I didn't need them since I would unlock the door. I quietly unlocked my indoor pools door and closed it. I then realized that I had forgotten to unlock the handles lock, and was very suddenly faced with the realization that at 3 in the morning, I was stuck outside my house, still tripping insanely.

My friend then called and asked how I like them, and he started laughing at me when I said I was locked outside. He wished me luck and hung up. So then I decided that something must be unlocked in my house. I walked all around my house, enjoying nature and all of the patterns appearing on the forest floor around me. I then sat down next to my garage to think about the situation. The trees all around me seemed to weave and dance, laughing at me that I was so stupid to lock myself out of my house. I decided to tell the trees to shut the hell up, and I went down to the pool, and tried the door again. I then sat down next to the pool and decided to call one of my friends to calm me down because I was very quickly descending into a bad trip.

Fumbling with my phone, in slow motion it fell out of my hand right into the pool. I quickly reached down, and with half of my body underwater I pulled my phone out. It was dead. I also drenched my nice coat and it was about 20 degrees outside. So I took off my coat and sat there. At about this point I assumed that I was going to die, being soaking wet with no phone or jacket stuck outside my house at 3 in the morning. I decided that being outside was stupid so I went to the front door of my house and rang the doorbell about 7 times before my sister saw me.

She yelled out 'Mom its only Chris'. So they opened the door and my mom was yelling about me somehow being outside the house at 4 in the morning, and that they thought that I was a burglar so they had called security. They promptly called of security, and I told them that I was sorry and I had felt sick and needed to get some fresh air. I then said good night and started to go to my room when my mom called me back down. I then got interviewed by her for 15 minutes before I was allowed to go to my room. During this interview, her face was still melting and everything around me was freaking out. After getting to my room, I sat in my bed awake for the rest of the trip, dreading the next morning.

With all of the bad events that happened to me, I would not have traded that night for anything. That night is what gave me my love for shrooms, where I then went on to have a second extremely successful trip which I will probably write a story about later. Hopefully I have many more trips to come.</bodytext></report>
