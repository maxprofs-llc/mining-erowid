I started smoking mj when I was about 17, right before I left for college. I loved the mellow feeling it gave me, and how much my friends and I laughed when we were high. I didn't smoke that much--if I had some, it would be every day. If I didn't, maybe just a couple of times a month, or whenever it floated my way. I still smoke on and off to this day (10 yrs later), though it has dwindled to about 10 times a year.

The occasion that sparked the title to this essay, happened a few years ago. I was smoking a few hits everday after work and had been for about six months. One night, I went with a couple of friends to a party--we smoked in the car on the way there, and then toked again at a friend's apt before heading to the party. The amount of pot we smoked was a lot, but nowhere near as much as I had smoked before--I didn't think twice.

About a half hour later, at the party, I was sipping on a beer when I started to have an extreme panic attack. I was really stressed out about something (not having a private bathroom, let's put it that way), and I couldn't get this thought out of my mind. I was becoming increasingly agitated. My stomach was in knots and my breathing was getting faster and shorter at the same time.

One of the friends I rode with (an acquaintance really) started to talk to me and I asked him if I could go somewhere and lie down. He started to walk me towards the last apartment we were at. We were walking, I felt a little better, but before I knew it, I started to get tunnel vision. We reached the stairs where I remember falling, and blacking out. I was only out for a second, and came to lying on the cement with this guy calling my name. For the next hour or so I just sat around, too scared to stand up again. I kept slurring my words too! It was really embarassing...

I still smoke MJ as I reported before, but I'm curious to this day as to what exactly happened there. Other people had smoked the same stuff, so I am pretty positive it wasn't laced. It was just a just a really abnormal experience for a drug I consider so mellow, and safe, and trust me, I've done my fair share of harder drugs. But that's another story.
