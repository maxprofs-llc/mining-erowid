Twas another sad day knowing that all my opiate connects were dry. I've been searching for weeks for a legal alternative to getting that opiate buzz. Even though I was unsuccessful in my quest, I came across some interesting herbs.....

12:30  7.5 mL of valerian was taken. If I to compare the taste of this to somthing it would have to be peas. Taste like someone took a bag of green peas and made some kind of liquor out of it. It almost instantly lets me know its there with a tiny little head buzz.

12:50 Starting to sweat a little bit, I notice a feeling of chill in my brain almost telling me to stop writing and listen to some music. Another 7.5 mL was taken.

1pm After confirming that the heat was coming from my body and not my house, I sat in my kitchen a smiled a bit.  Nice enjoyable heat though, very odd that im auctually enjoying this heat. The tea is just about ready, looks like a dark cloudy maple syrup. A very bitter and rancid concoction, especially without sugar. Instantly calming like chamomile, however. The kettle says a little over 50 oz, so i got a lot of drinking to do. I'm going to take a break from writing and watch some rocky marathon.
