I am a healthy 24-year-old male, and started exploring psychedelics about a year ago. The following account describes my first experience with 2C-T-2, which took place two days ago. This account was reconstructed using a combination of a log from a chat room, a few notes on paper, and memory. I measured my blood pressure and temperature several times during the experiment. I had been taking a break from psychedelic experiments for a few months due to a bad AMT experience. In fact, I believe I may have had some subconscious guilt because I had promised myself and others that I would not use any drugs for at least a year.

7:41 pm: First feelings of something out of the ordinary
/n
/n
8:08 pm: Feeling 'fuzzy' and getting chills. I see ripples moving across the carpet. Temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (rectal)
/n
/n
8:15 pm: I begin shivering, which comes and goes throughout the experience. 'I starting to notice patterns in the carpet now, lights seem to persist longer after closing my eyes than I would expect. A bit of an ache in the back of my head, but not too bad.'
/n
/n
8:23 pm: Listening to some music, I notice underlying melodies that I had not noticed before. 'Distances seem to be greater than usual.'
/n
/n
8:27 pm: 'I'm seeing distortions in the ceiling, like it's bunching together.'
/n
/n
8:33 pm: 'I'm seeing rainbows in my peripheral vision' Temperature: 99.0 degrees Fahrenheit (rectal)
/n
/n
8:45 pm (approximate): I am startled when music I am listening to suddenly seems to start skipping. In fact, it had simply reached a repetitious part of the melody. The volume of the music seems to suddenly increase and decrease.  At times I seem to hear it crystal clear, at other times it sounds as though it's coming from inside a cave.

8:47 pm: 'Now I'm starting to remember how this feels and why I liked it'
/n
/n
8:48 pm: 'I was talking about a higher dose experiment tomorrow, but now I'm not sure I will. [...] I dunno, it just occurs to me that I'm poisoning myself. I guess I should just respect my body more.'

/n
8:50 pm: Blood pressure: 136/88 pulse: 100
/n
/n
9:11 pm: 'I'm seeing some faint rainbows if I close my eyes for a while'
/n
/n
9:19 pm: Window Media Player, the program I using to listen to music on my computer, generates some animated abstract graphics when playing music. If I close my eyes while watching these graphics, I can faintly see them continue.

/n
/n
9:56 pm: I feel achy. 'It seems like most of the good feelings didn't stay.'
/n
/n
10:01 pm: 'I feel like I've isolated myself so much.'
/n
/n
10:10 pm: Blood pressure: 134/97 Pulse: 112
/n
/n
10:15 pm: 'I've gone through almost a liter of Gatorade. I'm pretty thirsty.' I had also had about 600 mL of water.
/n
/n
10:21 pm: 'I had romantic notions of being a psychonaut, doesn't seem to be so romantic at this point.'
/n
/n
10:22 pm: 'I'm seeing little green lights in the carpet. I can still see the lights if I move my head away, but when facing the carpet, they snap to certain regular points in the pattern.'

/n
10:29 pm: Temperature: 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit (rectal)
/n

10:34 pm: Blood pressure: 141/103 Pulse: 106
/n
/n
10:44 pm: 'Problems with motor control are frustrating me.'
/n
/n
10:45 pm (approximate): Turned on the television and started watching a satirical news program. I find it very funny, and wish I had been watching it from the beginning. The sound sometimes seems to echo. At the time I wondered if I was noticing an artifact of my television's cheap speakers.

I did not find this experiment to be particularly rewarding, but maybe with a better set and setting, the benefits might have outweighed the unpleasant side effects. I might try another experiment with this chemical, but not any time soon.</bodytext></report>
