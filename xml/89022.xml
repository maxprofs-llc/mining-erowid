I'll keep this relatively simple. The main purpose behind this post is to warn others that this medication is very highly capable of causing seizures in ANYONE.

One day, I decided I wanted to try this synthetic opiate [sic] my grandma takes for her chronic arthritis, called Tramadol. I took 3, and felt pretty good. Mood lifted, felt floaty, warm, fuzzy...typical of your average opiate. Well, the next time I tried, I upped it to 5 (4 50mg pills). Felt even better. Then, I pushed it to 6. I was in the living room of my girlfriends house, smoking a little bud, and felt suuuuper good. I began to feel weird spasms that were only a split second in duration. The best description was that I felt at the threshold of a seizure. Sure as hell, whaddya know. Next thing I remember is slumping over, then a blackout, then staring into the blurry image of an EMT's face. I couldnt even say my own name to them. I was rushed to the hospital, luckily with no damage at all. however, the doc said that my kidneys were very close to failing. This drug produces a good feeling, but it is not worth the recreation. Keep it under 200mg and I can still get a good feeling perhaps mixed with some herb and stay safe. Be careful.</bodytext></report>
