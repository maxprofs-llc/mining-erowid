For over thirty years now every weekend I have been enjoying what I consider my favourite high. Firstly I take a few tokes of primo weed then a swig of very nice liquer then me and my boyfriend go to bed for by now I have a raging horn. Then when I'm ready to blow I sniff the amyl and then HIT THE ROOF, a very intense experience every time, never fails.</bodytext></report>
