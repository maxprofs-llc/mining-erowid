A few friends and I decided that we wanted to try and make some of our own absinthe. So we looked up how to desolve thujone(psychoactive chemical in wormwood), and it could be desolved with either ethanol, diethyl ether, or formaldahyde. And since we did not have the means to get ride of the last two we just bought a bottle of grain alchol added .11 lbs of wormwood and set it at a low boil/simmer for an hour. To apply heat to the mixture we simply used a makeshift pressure cooker. NOTE: do not let the grain alcohol get near open fire or to be extra safe oxygen (we learned this the hard way). Also not a lot of heat was necessary to acquire the effects we sought.

After boiling the concotion for an hour the liquid had taken on a deep green color. Once we strained the mix and got out all of the wormwood herb and placed it in the bottle we noticed that when held up to the light the extract emitted no light through. The mixture also had a pungent smell to it.

Our group, after gathering our courage, then mixted the extract like so: one part extract, one part dry gin, two parts water, two tablespoons of sugar, and a twist of lime (for the sake of your pallet, if this experement is repeated, I strongly suggest having a piece of lemon to suck after you down each sip).

After the first glass I sat down and began to notice a distinct high, such as I have never encountered before. My hands tingled, I was told to be totally spaced out, I felt wonderfully tranquil and relaxed, I was giggly, and it was like dope without the nods and not being able to converse with others. I also feel it necessary to mention that until this point I felt no effects from any of the alcohol that I had embibed. The buzz lasted for roughly a half an hour. However, the fowl taste on the back of my throat lasted much longer.

Criticisms and strongs points of experience. Next time I attempt this extract I will use anise, fennel, or corriander seeds, and probably some spearemint or peppermint. Eucalyptus mght not be a bad idea either. The high was short lived and I felt that downing that horendous crap is not worth it. So next time if the flavor cannot be enhanced I will try to find some other form of ingestion. The high was quite unique. For someone that has tried just about everything, this is a very tranquil and relaxing way to unwind. I found the experience to be very novil, and especially those who are into the late bohemian period might appreciate an experience like this.</bodytext></report>
