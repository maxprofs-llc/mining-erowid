I have had two years experience with recreational use of this drug in daily use.  I have used it alone and occasionally used with alcohol.

The high:  not as strong as Hydrocodone, it has a very pleasant, slow to act effect.

1. The first time I tried it I vomited within 45 minutes of  ingesting.

2. I have taken 300mg at 6pm, and still felt somewhat high the next day when I wake up at 8am.

The high:  mostly opiate feel with some speedy sensation. I never felt like nodding off.  This is something I have taken at work all day.  It is a mood enhancer.  I have never had anyone notice I am high.

Problems: 
/n
1. Urination:  At first, I had a problem urinating.  I had to concentrate and it feels constricted.  It took me 5 minutes standing there to get a stream going. It was a problem for me the 1st 3 months.  My body got used to it because now it is no problem.

2. Itching:  at the 200-300mg level I have experienced some itching.  It can be bothersome.  I don't consider it to be too much of a problem, but others may notice you are doing it. Be aware.

3. Sleeping:  I have had trouble sleeping at the higher levels. I feel very good, calm, buzzing.  However I have had many nights awake thinking the whole night.  It feels good, but too many of those nights have left me exhausted later on.

/n
4. Maintenance:  If I am without for a period of time after long term use, (and I mean a week) I felt agitated, and restless without it.  
/n
/n
5. Mixing.  I have taken this with alcohol. I am very tolerant to both alcohol and tramadol, but I would not drink more than 2-3 drinks while taking tramadol.
/n
/n
6. Overall:  I have used daily for 2 years now.  It is a solid, workman like high.  I can dictate how high I want to get, from a good buz at work to very high on the weekends with careful monitoring.</bodytext></report>
