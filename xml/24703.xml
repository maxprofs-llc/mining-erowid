After domestic arguments one day I was feeling very low and decided to pop down 10 of my anti-depressant (Zoloft Sertaline) at once. Felt like the right thing to do at the time.

After probably about half an hour, I started to feel very fluey, nauseas. I went outside and had a bit of a chuck. The agony didnt go away. My pupils were the size of golf balls. I had a shuffling walk. All of these I later found on an internet site were symptoms of an overdose. Also my jaw was originally LOCKED close, until I used extreme forced and popped it open. But despite the fact it was like four months ago my jaw still clicks in pain everytime I move it (jaw and neck spasms were a symptom which apparently require IMMEDIATE medical attention, which I still haven't sought).

I did not go to hospital this time. I simply called the poisons hotline and said 'my brother' has taken 10 of his anti-depressants and the guy on the phone said to get 'him' to the hospital straight away because he could die, but I wound up ok after maybe a day or two (despite the jaw problems till this day).</bodytext></report>
