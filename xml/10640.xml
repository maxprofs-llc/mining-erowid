I'm an old head from days gone by, but have never deliberitly tried to get high on kava. From years of experience with kava, and many other medicinal herbs, I can tell you that having a couple of onces of kava powder on hand is a necessity. Especially if you have a tendacy to get freaked out from time to time. What I mean is a stressed,nervous, depressed, mad, totally FREAKED OUT mood that makes you feel like you are going absolutely crazy! For whatever reason, hell life and the world can be pretty screwed up sometime. This is when kava's use is it's very best. For me, two heaping teaspoons of powder downed with good 'ol water, almost instantly transformes me into a normal, calm thinking state with a little buzz to the nerves, and some butterfly's in the tummy to boot. I even giggle a little thanking God for such a wonderful herb. That is what I use kava for, and believe me....it works!</bodytext></report>
