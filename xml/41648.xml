My mother drug tests me, I read about putting 6ml in a 60cc sample of urine. 
/n
She uses Home Marijuana Test Kits that she buys at pharmacies.
/n
/n
I had smoked 2 bowls of headies weed on friday night, for the first time in 
/n
over 2 weeks (I know I was clean previously because I had been drugtested by 
/n
her 3 days before I smoked again, and I passed). Saturday night, I smoked 
/n
another bowl. Sunday morning I ate a poptart with about .5 grams of shwagg 
/n
cooked in. Tuesday, I was tested.
/n
/n
So, I put approximatly 6ml of visine in the urine (slightly diluted because 
/n
I drank 3 cups of water beforehand). I failed.
/n
/n
So people who say that visine yield false negatives are wrong, because in my experience, it does not. I'm 17 years old, weigh 130.</bodytext></report>
