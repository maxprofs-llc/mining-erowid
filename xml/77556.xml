Prologue: About a month and a half ago, a friend of mine and I acquired some 2c-b. Prior to this, I had lots of experience with DXM, a salvia trip, and a half-assed DMT experience (I wouldn't call it a trip); however, that was pretty much the extent of my psychedelic use. This trip happened about a month ago, so my memory is a little fuzzy on some aspects of it.

I had gotten off work one night when my friend, I'll call him Don, came over and spent the night at my house. We had some 2c-b, and we were very anxious to try this wonderful phenethylamine. Don weighed about 30mg each for us to take orally. We put this powder in a gelcap but didn't bother to cap them. My stomach was empty, and Don's was more or less empty as well. We started to feel minor effects within 30 minutes; I couldn't exactly pinpoint what they were, just the general feeling that something is different. After about an hour and a half, there were almost no mental effects present and few visuals. Don didn't want to have 3-4 more hours of this; he wanted to trip hard, as did I.

We decided to weigh out 10mg each and snort that, bringing the total dosage to 40mg. I decided to make two tiny lines in order to make snorting easier and the onset a little faster. We had heard how terrible the pain from snorting 2c-b was; however, I was reluctant to believe that only 10mg of powder could burn so terribly. Oh how wrong I was. 2c-b is INCREDIBLY painful. When I first snorted the 2c-b, I thought to myself, man everyone must be a pussy, this is nothing. About ten seconds later, the pain set in. It was very bad and almost made me feel physically ill. My eyes watered, my nose ran, my face ached. After about five minutes, I was barely feeling the 2c-b, though Don noted that he was tripping ever since he snorted his 10mg.

We went downstairs to a room where there is a computer and a television; Don watched some tv while I surfed the web. We had Intervention on (the episode with Ben, the DXM junky); however, Don wanted it changed because it was becoming too depressing. He sat in a chair and closed his eyes to explore CEVs and have an internal trip. I looked at my fingers while I was typing; the keys started floating around while my fingers started to stretch and resemble spaghetti noodles. This was absolutely fascinating to me. I looked at the chair where Don was, and the chair has a pattern on it, a bunch of black, golden yellow, dark green, and dark red stripes all over it. However, when I looked at it, all the colors seemed to smooth out, and the chair looked as though it was big, stripes, instead of the thins stripes it usually is. It is kind of hard to describe how it looked. Don's face started to change into a variety of funny faces, and I laughed it him, which made him kind of annoyed.

It was about 1 a.m. now, and we decided to go outside and walk to a local park. On our walk, we were remarking on how different we felt, and how awesome it was. We walked under a tree, and we both felt as though there was a huge spiderweb that got on both of us. I have no idea if there was an actual web we walked through or not. I had trouble walking straight, and we were sharing an iPod set to mostly Goa/Psytrance, Infected Mushroom, Hallucinogen, Astral Projection, etc. While we were en route to the park, we would experience bouts of sobriety, which was very odd. I made an observation that seemed genius at the time: 'it's always there, you just acknowledge it [the high] in waves.' We got to the park in about ten minutes, and the way the park is set up, there is a long shelter area with picnic tables with a stretch of grass and then finally a playground. I walked through the shelter area, and when I passed under a street light, Don's face started to morph into other people that I knew. This alarmed me, and I wanted Don to return to normal to give me a sense of security.

Right after passing through the shelter, there seemed to be a large piece of plastic that trapped the playground in a bubble, much like Springfield in The Simpsons movie. This was very funny, and we ran through the grass to maneuver through the plastic. I felt as though I had crossed into another world after I had passed through it. I went up to the playground set; I climbed up the metal to the highest position. This is in a pentagonal shape with a roof and plastic walls on three sides of it. We proceeded to lay down in the little landing, though it was not very comfortable. We each put an earbud into one of our ears, and we started to really trip.

The sky seemed a dark purple, and the tops of trees would grow and shrink at random. They would also run around the top of the landing we were in. Occasionally, brightly colored gummy-bears would emanate from the trees. Don pulled out a joint made of weed that I had found in my garage from when my dad was a hippie for Halloween one year. We smoked this together, though upon later inspection, the weed wasn't high quality.
/n

We started talking about something, when suddenly one of us would completely disregard what had just been said and go off on an unrelated tangent. This happened all throughout the time we spent at the playground. Despite this, we managed to keep the conversations going at once, and we would discuss the same five or so topics throughout the trip; however, they were not in a linear type of conversing. This talking was very deep, about nature and life and most anything.

Don uttered the phrase 'contradiction and confusion' in order to describe our trip. This seemed greatly appropriate, considering how that's what composed the majority of the trip. He would say something, and I would refute his point and vice versa. He also said I was 'like a male ram, trying to establish dominance' and I was somewhat imposing on him; this made me feel bad, and I told him not to apologize for his behavior, like how if I punched him in the face, he 'shouldn't apologize for getting hit.'

After about three hours of this, we decided it was time to return to my house, since it was about 5 a.m., and my mom was home. We sneaked back in my house, went up to my room, and put on some Shpongle. The music, however, woke up my mom. We then decided it was time to go to sleep, as all the effects, save slight visuals, had left us.

It was what I would consider to be my first real 'trip,' though I have had several 3rd and a few 4th plateau DXM trips. It was a great experience with a great chemical, and I learned many things from this trip.</bodytext></report>
