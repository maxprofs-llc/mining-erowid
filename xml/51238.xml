At first the valerian appeared to relax and calm me, taking 2 tablets night and day. I was taking it for generalized anxiety disorder. However, within a week I felt sleepy and groggy. I thought those symptoms would go awawy, which they did, but after another week I became extremely depressed, nervous, vague and foggy. I have stopped taking the Valerian for 24 hours so far but I still feel very bad. Hopefully this will remit soon.</bodytext></report>
