It was a typical Friday morning and I woke up around 9AM.  I didn't have school and work wasn't until 4 so I decided the best thing for me was a little ether to get me going (it is starting fluid after all). I was quite relaxed and worry free, mostly wanting to a bit of self exploration.  I did the well documented but ineffective water method because I feel it is easier to use in a non-aerosol form, preferring to suck up the top layer with an oral syringe left over from a surgery.  I got about 35ml of starting fluid from the first go and squirted about a third of it onto a bit of towel I had ripped off.  I sat down on a desk in my garage and inhaled deeply through my nose.  At first the smell was a bit overpowering but I pushed forth, undeterred.

After about 3 huffs I was starting to fell a little funny and continued on, reapplying the remainder of the syringe full within 7 minutes.  During those 7 minutes I noticed the buzzing of the fluorescent lighting above me beginning to echo and sound a bit like a toy train bell I had as a kid.  I didn't quite realize how affected I was until I stopped huffing.  I stood in the same spot for about 10 minutes without even noticing time pass, and I will do my best to describe to you what happened in those moments.

I stood up from the desk, which happened to actually be from my kindergarten classroom, and I thought I was back in my old school, which I haven't visited for 5 years or more.  Nothing really looked like the school but it felt like I was there anyway.  Then I walked over to the workbench and stared at this piece of wood trim which triggered something from my distant childhood.  I was struck by a memory of my dad saying Your mom is not supposed to be home till... then he would lock up like an old video game and turn away, only to restart the same statement over and over.  This had to go on for only a minute but it seemed like a long time.  Next, I came to and turned away from the workbench and started thinking about when I had heard my dad say that.  I looked inside of myself and started to think about why I got high.  It felt like I was supposed to figure something out so I set off into my mind and  looked for an answer.  After several minutes of thinking and eventually returning to the same point I started at, I became confused and decided to have a cigarette.

After the cigarette I felt like I was coming down but I had told myself I wasn't going to do anymore ether today.  That willpower lasted for about 30 seconds as I fixed up about 20ml more and started huffing again.  When that was over, my brain wanted more but my lungs said Hell no so I walked (I wish to think it was walking) to the stairs and listened for sounds of anyone who may have come home. I only heard the Science Channel but it sounded really strange.  Everything was echoing very badly and while I could understand what they were saying, it seemed like some strange language to me.  I could only imagine if anyone had been there to talk to me what I would have sounded like.

I watched a bit if TV (something about Bigfoot I do believe) for probably 20 minutes and took a shower.  By that time I had almost completely come down off of my amazing train ride.  I went to work at 4 and I was feeling fine, my reflexes were off quite a bit and my lungs felt funny.  Over 24 hours later I was hanging out with my woman and she said I smelled like a dry erase marker.  No matter what I do, I smell for quite a while.

I have done ether once since then and had much of the same trip, only I had almost found the answer that time.  I think the answer was that I can't find the real answer getting high on ether.  Overall, it was quite a pleasant experience, even if my lungs don't feel right for about a day afterwards and I smell like a gas station.  I hope to someday experience this with friends and see how interesting things get.  Thank you for reading my experience.</bodytext></report>
