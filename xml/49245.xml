At one point in my life I was taking 6-8mg of Xanax daily for nearly a month.  This was partly a psychological addiction on my part, but what I want to focus on is the physical withdrawal symptoms.  Withdrawal for me involved, no sleep, nightmares, constant nausea, pain, mental agony, major sinus problems.  In other words, a living hell.

Would I do this drug again?  Yes, but I will never get physically addicted again.  Even though I had the mental strength to stop, it is so incredibly painful and dangerous I would not repeat it ever.

My ability to store memories is practically gone.  I have no inhabitations.  I fall off a bike and cut myself, but am completely numb to pain.

It's a fairly sedate and restful feeling also.  The feeling is not euphoria per say, but a permeating numbness.</bodytext></report>
