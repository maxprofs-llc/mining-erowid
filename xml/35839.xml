I am a 39 year old musician who is totally blind.  I have been experamenting with mind alteration for about 20 years  I purchased a 2 gram vial of 13x salvia extract, a case of beer, and went back to my home. I put some pink floyd on the sterrio, put 1 sixth of a gram in my pipe, inhailed, and left my living room, the world, and possibley the universe.  A lot of my friends ask me what it is like to trip beeing blind, and I have never been able to acuratly discribe the experience.  I have experamented with everything from shrooms to l.s.d., but never have I experienced anything like salvia.  Both the physical as well as the mental sinsations were beyond words.  A feeling of motion, beeing touched, and not beeing at all.  At one moment I had a feeling of free fall that was so strong that I actually had to grab the arms of my rocking chair to assure myself that I was not falling at all, but indeed still sitting there in my own living room. I want to find out more.  I have heard about liquid salvia and am curious about it's effects and possibilities.</bodytext></report>
