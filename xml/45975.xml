In my ongoing search for the perfect legal psychoactive substance I decided to try HBW. I have had mostly good experiences with similar trips in the past so was hoping for an interesting night. Being a bit of a hardhead I took 10 seeds and broke them up in a mortar and pestle, removing some of the outer skin but finding most to be impossible to separate from the flesh. I packed the powder into 2 200mg capsules and swallowed them with orange juice. I had deliberately eaten lightly that day and had avoided food for 4 hours prior to injestion. My partner decided he wanted a pizza so we jumped in the car and popped down to the local takeout. On return as I was getting out of the car I had my usual alert, my nose started to run but instead of fading out as usual my sinuses completely closed off and I was only able to breathe through my mouth. My partner ate most of the pizza but by then I was getting hungry so I had one small slice. This was about 30 minutes after the capsules.

At T+60 minutes I was aware of changes in perception and a decidedly uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. I felt extremely stoned and noticed my eyes flickering. Pupils were dilated and muscle wringing was happening. This continued at a similar level for 3 hours with a gradual ramp up to slight visual disturbance, the carpet was shimmering, and my thoughts were getting increasingly focused on my stomach and the other body discomfort. Getting a bit bored I gave up on the night and decided to go to bed.

Sleep was impossible! The muscle wringing caused constant movement and I was peeing every 45 minutes, I was very dehydrated and had frequent sips of water. Eventually I gave up and at T+8 hours, 3 in the morning, my best friend who was staying with us, decided to sit with me and watch some TV. We never made the living room. I stopped at the bathroom on the way and promptly purged violently from both ends. Its a good thing my friend is very close and has a sense of humour and that the sink is so close to the bowl. Of course the pizza was completely undigested, Lovely!

The purging obviously released some of the trapped crushed seeds because my eyes rapidly dilated almost fully and the visual effects increased, unfortunately so did the body load so we made our careful way to the TV room with a bowl just in case.

At T+11 hours with no loss of level I finally fell asleep on the couch only to be awakened 2 hours later by the postman. I was still wildly tripping but at a slightly reduced level. I must have been a scary sight as I answered the door. By T+18 hours I was back to baseline but totally trashed. Its now T+26 hours and I feel like I have had a dose of flu. The blocked sinuses were clear by the time I was back at baseline.

Never again! These seeds are going into the garden. The insight was negligable and the visuals unimpressive for the level of body load, I'll stick to good old Salvia from now on.</bodytext></report>
