Ok, so I saw on all previous reviews of 4-MEC that everyone was bumping it and insuflating. As my experience in the past with similar chems such as MDMA, MDPV, and straight up cut with whaterver 'X' would dictate, I chose to ingest this stuff...AWESOME IDEA.

If you have ever tried Molly's Plant Food this is the suitable replacement for it. It starts out with a euphoric surge and then the ability to not stay still takes on about 45 mins from onset. Euphoria is present through onset and all the way into comedown. Granted its not as big as the onset but I have not experienced any feeling of bad mood.

I feel great and can't be mad at anyone right now. It definitely feels 'cleaner', and I dont feel the need to chew gum all the time. The urge to reuse is definitely there but not anymore than any other MDPV-like chem.

AND any activity sexual or otherwise that you like with other MDMA supplements is super fun and 'tingly' and guys just concentrate a little bit harder with your expanded thought process it takes a little bit more effort to sustain 'memeber attention'.

Will definitely use this one again! When taken orally this is more like a 3-6 hour duration of good stuff then comedown isnt anything to worry about, the next day I felt elevated and not hungover emotionally. slight stomach irritation is my only complaint and that was present during use as well.</bodytext></report>
