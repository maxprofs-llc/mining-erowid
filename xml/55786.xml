This report is written as a friendly warning to all those who think that that they can play around with Nutmeg 'once or twice' and suffer no long-lasting effects. I'm a staunch beleiver in a person's freedom to subject themselves to any chemical(s) of their choosing, provided they can accept the consequences. My goal is to describe my Nutmeg experiences, so that you (the reader), have a better idea of what the consequences can be. With that said, let me get straight to the report.

To begin with, I am a 150 lb. male of 16 years. I had started to get interested in psychoactives a few months prior to my Nutmeg experiments, which occurred about 8 months ago, with an emphasis on psychedelics and hallucinogens. I had done some research on nutmeg which proved, in hindsight, to be insufficient. I heard that nutmeg could cause hallucinations, and without much further study, decided to try to acheive a mind-blowing experience.

The first thing I tried doing was eating one and a half whole nutmegs, prior to going out to see a movie. If I had any effects, the movie distracted me from them. However, when it ended, I did have mild cotton-mouth, and very bloodshot eyes. I had a mild headache the next morning, which ended a few hours after getting up.

Undaunted, I decided to try again a few weeks later. I wanted to get the myristicine experience without having to put all that bulk-ground-up shit through my system. I then tried to make some nutmeg tea. I used about 3/4 of a fairly large nutmeg, powdered it with a fine cheese-grater, and steeped it in 2 cups boiling water for about 15 minutes. The myristicin did indeed appear in the tea, as a number of white, waxy, floating particles. After straining the tea, and trying to conserve as much myristicin as possible, I drank the resulting liquid.

About 1/2 an hour later, I felt a sort of drunken light-headedness, almost like a small rush, and thought 'Wow, it's really working'. These feeling intensified for about 45 minutes. Then I decided to go on a walk outside. I realized that I was feeling jittery and euphoric, full of a sort of nervous, giggly energy that made me want to run around laughing (which I did, briefly). Eventually, after about two hours, I came down, and went to sleep, with no adverse side effect other than some rather bloodshot eyes.

The bad effects started during the next couple of days. Going to school, I realized that I wasn't able to remember things as well, and kept forgetting assignments, appointments, etc. This became very pronounced after two or three weeks, when I finally realized that I was undergoing some real memory problems. I had to resort to writing things of any importance on my arms in marker, just so I could remember them.

Apparently the rule 'Once bitten, Twice shy' did not seem to apply to my experiences. I realized that I was experiencing pronounced memory trouble, and yet I didn't really think that the nutmeg could be responsible. After about 1 1/2 months, I decided to try the tea again. My memory had picked up a tiny bit since, but was still very impaired. Again I used the same dosage, and experienced the same effects. And, right on schedule, my memory problems set in.

After doing more research, I realized that the nutmeg was almost certainly the source of my problems. I was taking no other psychoactives at the time (including medications), and so beleive the nutmeg to be responsible. However the memory problems persisted for three four, five months, not improving in the slightest. After month six, however, my memory began to improve very gradually. I also began taking ginko extracts, which seemed to help somewhat. Now, eight months after my last experiment, I am still not back to 'Normal', memory-wise. I am much better than I was three or even one month ago, but I still have trouble keeping everything together in my head, with names, projects, phone numbers, and so forth. I do not know if I will ever be able to attain my pre-nutmeg memory again. Incidentally, before all of this happened I had an exceptionally good memory, which gave me a real edge in school. No longer. And possibly never again.

The point of all of this is that nutmeg, or any other drugs, for that matter, can have long term consequences beyond the immediate high or trip. If you want to take psychoactives responsibly, you should study the long term effects as seriously as the short term. Remember: Always 'Tune in' (to the knowledge) before you 'Turn On', so that you don't 'Drop Out' :)</bodytext></report>
