/n
/n
2:30-3:30 -- Shower felt amazing. Got amazing closed eye visuals and slight open eye visuals. I have come to realize that it is very hard to multitask on this substance, very easy to get stuck doing the same thing even when you are planning on doing other things.

Summary/Afterthoughts:

/n
This is an amazing substance, extremely good body high, tactile sensation was probably the most prevalent feeling from this substance. I really liked the fact that it made me feel awake with out being overpowered with a stimulant feeling.</bodytext></report>
