After rummaging through my grandfather's pharmaceuticals, I discovered a container of Tylenol 3. Each pill contained 30 mg of Codeine, and 300 mg of Acetaminophen. I tried taking 3 pills, with only mild euphoria. Several days later, and after some research, I decided to take 11 pills, for a total of 330 mg of Codeine, and 3.3 g of Acetaminophen. Although this was quite a lot, I figured that my large body (117 kg) could handle it. I was wrong.

The trip started nicely enough, with slight euphoria about 20 minutes after consumption. 10 minutes later, I felt a strong tingling sensation, as if my muscles were being tickled from the inside. From here the trip took on a very unpleasant character. I had the alarming sensation of labored breathing. It wasn't that I wasn't capable of breathing, but rather that I had to force myself to breathe. When I held my breath for example, I had no urge to breathe again like you normally would. It was as if I had no automatic urge to breathe at all. This was perhaps the worst part of the experience, as I was afraid that if I passed out, I would not be able to breathe on my own. I later learned that labored breathing is the first sign of codeine poisoning. Fortunately, those symptoms did not worsen, and I was able to enjoy the trip a little. I discovered that it was much more enjoyable when I lied down and closed my eyes. The Codeine lasted for a couple of hours, and then faded away, to be replaced by nausea. It felt as if I had the flu for two or three more hours.

The next day, I had trouble urinating, and experienced constapation, as I had expected. I also feel somewhat hung-over. My advice to anyone experimenting with Codeine would be to use it in moderation. Despite the fact that I was below the daily maximum of both Codeine and Acetaminophen, and that I am quite a large person, I believe that I experienced Codeine and Acetaminophen poisoning. It is not a pleasant experience. Keep in mind that the Codeine does not become any more euphoric after a certain dosage. My dose was 2.8 mg/kg.</bodytext></report>
