This is commonly known as 'candy-flipping'. I'm not sure why. I've only done it once, and I found that there was indeed a powerful, synergistic effect. The common procedure is to take the LSD about 3 or so hours before the MDMA, so you're just starting the peak of your trip when you begin to roll. Dosage wise, I tried ~150-160ug of LSD with ~100mg of MDMA.

The combination was extremely powerful. Although I had had a very bad day I was enjoying my trip. About 20-30 minutes after I took the Ex, I could feel the onset. Its difficult to explain, but as I was already tripping I felt in great detail the beginning of the MDMA effects on a very physical level... I could feel the speeding of my heart and breathing, and felt the MDMA-ness go from my center and spread gradually to my limbs. This all may of course be psychosomatic.

As the Ex took effect, the visual characteristics of the scene began to change, and I found that my emotional reaction to objects and people *strongly* cast their appearance. There was a definite combination of the MDMA 'everything is beautiful' look and the Acid's power to warp the actual appearance of things.

As the evening went on, I started to find the combined effect unmanageable. As I said before, I had had a bad day, and I was probably in a poor set for trying a new psychedelic experience. Gradually I became overwhelmed with sadness and despair about all the things I had done and said wrong over the last few days, and became extremely mentally and physically disoriented, and I needed a friend's help to get me through the rest of the evening.

All in all, I thought it was an extremely powerful and interesting experience, and parts of it I truely enjoyed. MDMA seemed to powerfully reinforce the reality bending aspects of LSD, and LSD opened a new door on the emotional projections of MDMA. I will definitely try it again, as soon as I feel comfortable with it (this was my first negative psychedelic experience in about a year of use).</bodytext></report>
