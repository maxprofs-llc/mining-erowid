Vinpocetine has proven to be very much beneficial as the first neuro-nutrient Ive tried. I was considering Piracetam initially, but something about taking up to a gram or more of a chemical for effects just kind of turned me off, especially when the dosage for vinpocetine is usually between 5-30 or so milligrams.

No attack dose whatsoever was needed, I could tell something was going on the first few times I took it. It seems to primarily work on memory and a little on certain color enhancement type of things. Initially short term memory was a little better, but taking it every day for about a month or two now seems to help long term memory as well. I currently have a 93% in an advanced algebra class I thought I was going to drop the week I started taking it (the vinpocetine).

My dosing pattern is usually 5-10 mgs plus one super multi-vitamin 3 times a day, usually 10-15 mgs total on a regular day, 20-25 on school days, and 30 or so on days that I've had exams. I found I had headaches when I first started taking it a few hours after eating a capsule or two (worsened the more I took, although they were never really bad at all). I have found a way around the subtle headaches however; Ive learned to moderate dosages and collaborate vinpocetine + vitamins (containing 11 mg choline, which some say cures headaches associated with Piracetam), and my body probably just got used to it.

One of the best things about Vinpocetine Ive found is its ability that when taken at night, it does not give me jittery energy, make me a little confused, like a lot of caffeine can. On the contrary, I find my mind to be a little intellectually stimulated, and although it gives me no energy, I just forget that I was tired earlier in the day and Im able to stay up later comfortably. This would be great for cramming for a test or even just hanging out with friends late on the weekend after a particularly tiring week.

Calling for more experimentation was the night I pre-loaded for the evening with a vitamin, 50 mg 5-htp, and 5 mg vinpocetine taken every 30-45 minutes three times. I felt like I was almost rolling before even taking any MDMA. I did end up going overboard that night, and the MDMA experience would be pointless to cross-reference with vinpocetine. On the other hand, I am very eager to try it again at a later date, and also to try vinpocetine with a psychedelic.</bodytext></report>
