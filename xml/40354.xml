My name is JJ, I am 15 years old, and have been a drug user for about 2 years. My main drug was weed, creativity fuel, music enhancer, and chill drug. I have recently been expirimenting with cheap ways to get high. I have tried robitussin (tussin for my ghetto ass) and benedryl (allergy elixer for my ghetto ass). I have also tried a few inhalants, but none as strong as dust-off. The only inhalant that I would compare to this stuff is whip-its. OK, well here goes my story for a fun filled night.

Well this was gonna be one boring night. I was at my friends house, lets just call him B. His brother had all the alcohol and weed connections around here, so we were talking to him about getting something. He said his alcohol hook ups were unavailable tonight, and his weed man wasnt gonna be able to come through. That really didnt matter too much, since B's mom didnt give him his money she promised him for babysitting. So then we were thinking of a way to get fucked up. The idea of freeon came up, he has tried it many times but I never had the chance to. So we waited a little bit until B's parents went to sleep and his younger siblings. We went outside, with a plastic bag and a pen, to try to get the freeon out of the AC unit. It was on at the time so we werent gonna fuck with it until it was off. We went back inside after we finished our cigarettes. Then he asked if we can get fucked up off of Dust-off. Then the fun started....

He said that his parents bought a pack of 4 the other day and it might be in his mom's van, if not then its in his parents room which we couldn't be able to get it in there. So in hopes that it was in the van, we went out there and opened the back door. He looked around for a little bit, I was feeling discouraged that we wouldnt find it. He looked under the back seat and pulled out a can. I was like 'Hell yea.' So, we went back inside and grabbed a few more cigs, and went outside. We sat down and lit our cigs, then each took a hit from the can. We took some more hits, finished our cigs, and went inside. B had been on his computer for a while before working on our web site, for our gang related music and clothing line. So we were passing the can back and forth, and it was my turn. This was about the 5th or 6th time I had hit it so far. I pressed the button down fully and inhaled a deep slow breath. I held it in for about 15 seconds when I started feeling the effects. Now Im feeling REALLY good.

I started hearing the normal WAWAWAWAWA after about 20 - 25 seconds of holding it in. Then I zoned out and stared at his computer screen, not moving my entire body for about a minute to a minute and a half. I wasnt blinking, breathing, or moving AT ALL!! Then out of no where I started laughing like I was extremely high off of some really potent buds. I laughed for about 30 seconds after I exhaled the hit. I was laughing and laughing and laughing, I just couldnt stop. I managed to mumble the words 'Im so fucked up dawg' and B was laughing at me.

I was still staring at the screen about 5-6 minutes after inhalation. Then I managed to mumble, 'play some music dawg.' Sometime along the way I took out my cd of rap beats that I produced, and inserted some of my crunk rap music. There were some real fighting songs on there, three 6 mafia, lil jon, and other rappers associated with them. Anyways, when I told him to put some music on, he asked if I had put the cd in, I said 'damn u must be really fucked up or dumb as shit, I just put it in there.' So I blabbered a freestyle during the time he was bringing up the media player. The cd came on, and I was bouncing my head. By the way, I was still fucked up and almost passed out right before he played the music, but I managed to pull myself together in time to hit the freestyle and listen to the music.

Overall, great drug, great experience(s) and I would definitely do it again, even though I feel like shit right now. I have a headache, stomach-ache, and feel very exhausted with chest/breathing pain (very slight).And what the fuck I just hear an extremely loud ringing noise in my ear, makes my headache even worse.</bodytext></report>
