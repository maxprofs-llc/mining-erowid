11:50pm: Awake. Clear-headed, slightly bored. No overpowering effects.

12:05pm: Full effects present. Exceptionally focused, some visual confusion (colors shifting, objects having nonsensical space-distortions, blurring and focus irregularities) which are interesting and enjoyable. Most effects brought on when attention is focused to something specific and allowed to wander. Listening to music is very enjoyable. 'Floating with music' sensation is present, not unlike the effects of marijuana, yet without giddyness and lack of coordination. The intelligent man's recreational drug? Attentiveness and focus on the order of adderall.
