5PM - I took 20g of nutmeg and its real hard to take down, like swallowing sand.

6PM - Starting to feel more relaxed and mellowed out; downed another 10 grams,

8:30PM - I start to feel really really stoned but not experiencing any visuals.  This 'stoned' sensation was constant til about my next update.

12:30AM - When everything changed completely. it felt like my body was deafened, my head was spinning and I saw colourful visuals when I closed my eyes.

I awoke at about 12PM the next day and my head was still spinning and i had a hardcore hangover. If you are thinking of using nutmeg as a substitute for marijuana you will be pretty disapointed because it isn't there isnt a substitute for herb. Overall it wasnt worth it, the hangover was just too much and it all got a bit messed up towards the end.</bodytext></report>
