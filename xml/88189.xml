My god. As I write I am high on MDPV which feels like the fusion of  MDMA and Crack; overwhelming. I feared its addictive potential so I threw my 500 mg outside my window. Mistake? Anyway. Shortly after I reclaimed the neglected white MDPV speckles in the mud and consumed it and WOW. I am as high as I was back in the loving pill popping days.

Sadly I haven't no one (especially a girl) to share this compulsive desire as I am trying break away from my endless drug habits. as we all know desires are subjective. In my dreams (when was 11) this would be what I'd imagine crack, methamphetamine or even coke to be like. since all of these stimulants have been rather disappointing this MDPV seems to justify that desire. well well. im going to spend this time listening to jesus and the mary chain and focusing on my work.

I will certainly report the side effects if this gets published. I am a generally a very anxious guy but so far no paranoia, anxiety or depression. not what one would expect from various reads.

And what to say something to all you protesters 'you can't protest cutting down trees with paper work'. Think about it.</bodytext></report>
