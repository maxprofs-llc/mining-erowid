I recently received a gram of 2C-I. My girlfriend &amp; I were going to try it together, but after it sat in my drawer for a month, I caved in and did it alone.

We were going to visit some friends &amp; family that lived far away today, so we got up *very* early. By the time we got to our destination, I could tell I had an emotionally safe temperment and was okay to take it. Ingested the 16mg gelcap at about 2pm.

about 3pm: Smoked some MJ, Very small alerts, wondering if I had taken enough, decided to sit it out for another hour before I tried supplements.

After 4pm: Waves of energy are rolling in and breaking back. One second I'll feel like i'm pure energy, the next I feel nearly sober (actually, stoned). Still there's doubt whether I took enough, but whenever I'd think to redose, I'd get hit with the energy-i just dropped the redosing thought completely.

5pm: Visuals remind me of LSD, carpet is moving, wood paneling on the wall seems to have more dimensions--its like looking into a cave. body load is never overwhelming, feels like MDA but it comes on smoothly and gets whisked away and comes back all day long.

the rest of the day was very similiar. i like the substance and will retry at a slightly larger dose. at 11pm still feeling small effects, got to sleep quite nicely in about 20 mins.

Next day, woke early, felt great, went to school clear minded and aced my test. Later that day (less than 24 hrs of ingestions still) I had ECG &amp; blood pressure tests done. ECG showed a normal sinus rhythm and my blood pressure was also normal on the low side.</bodytext></report>
