For years I have suffered from minor anxiety to full-blown panic attacks. Over time, with study of my condition, energetic healing, therapy, exercise, meditation and the use of other self-prescribed medication, I have never found a med more effective than Alprazolam, or 'XboX', as my circle refers to it.
/n
/n
I have been addicted to it in the past;
/n
  addiction to benzo's sorta can sneak up on you.
/n
To use this medication for treatment of anxiety, or recreationally, it is important not to let it run-away with you... be careful!
/n
Coming down off it, especially cold turkey, of more than 2-4mg+ a day for more than 14 days can FUCK WITH YOU - like coming off speed addiction. Paranoia, MAJOR INSOMNIA, edgyness, dillusions, physical sickness, can't think straight, oversensitivity to senses and flu-like symptoms, fatigue, nightmares and tremors.
/n

However, after a night on it, one can feel fantastic the next day, if used irregularly.
/n
/n
I find it grants me the exact opposite to many who descibe its effects; euphoria, body-highs*, empathy, extreme relaxation but no lost of motivation, increased comfortability in social situations, a clear-mind, no lose of motor control unless at about or over 6mg - sometimes a increase in creativity, clearer vision and joy.
/n
/n
Mixed with Alcohol, it is much more unpredictable, though can be extremely enjoyable, but can add for many the 'snoozaline' effect.
/n
However at high doses of both, one can become almost 'zombielike', with no recollection of events that they partook in, sometimes dangerous, sometime boring for those around them as 'short-term memory' can go TO HELL, and one can become unco-ordinated and participate in acts they have no recollection or control over.
/n
/n
I find it takes the psychotropic edge of marijuana, making it more sedative.
/n
/n
I find it completely destroys MDMA experiences, taking away the strength of the pill and the magic.
/n
/n
I find that it minimises the effects of true entheogens (LSD, mushrooms).
/n
/n
Mixed with amphetamine it can cause any interesting up/down synergism. It makes coming down off stimulants a breeze!
/n
/n
It is LESS euphoric than Diazepam, lasts about twice as long, is stronger and it's smoother. I have tested this extensively, but maybe IT'S JUST ME.
/n
/n
Be Safe, but the 'XboX' can be WONDERFUL if treated with respect.

Happy Doc-Shopping,
