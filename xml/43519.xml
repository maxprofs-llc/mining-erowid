This experience was VERY similar to Absinthe, which I drank in Edinburgh, Scotland two years ago.  I had found a recipe online for a vermouth recipe.  Vermouth is commonly used in Manhattens and Martinis.  It is a fortified aperitif wine.  The trick is to soak herbs in a standard wine and to add some higher-proof alcohol to the wine.

I bought a bottle of 2-buck chuck Chardonnay and started adding some herbs.  I found that it is easier to add liquid herbal extracts instead of straining the mix.  I added about 3 medicine droppers full of liquid wormwood Artemisia Absinthium, 3 medicine droppers full of liquid wormwood Artemisia annuam, 3 dashes of bitter orange extract, 3 dashes of fee brothers old-fashioned bitters (Contains Gentian root, cloves, cinnamon, and other flavours), and some cloves and sage, which I later filtered.  I then added about 4 ounces of Black rum to fortify the mixture.  I let this sit for a couple weeks, then I strained it.

The point of this long process was to mask the normally wretched flavour of the wormwood.  It worked.  I ended up with a sweet, pleasant, white wine vermouth.

I proceeded to drink about seven manhattens on the rocks.  I mixed them about half and half using my new vermouth and Kentucky Tavern Bourbon.  I went outside for a cigarette and realized the trees were moving without wind.  I decided in that moment that I was VERY glad to be alive.  The sounds of the birds were intoxicating.  I went back inside, and I closed my eyes.  I found the sound of the television to be so artificial and scripted.  It sounded inorganic and manufactured.  I decided to listen to some Cocteau Twins and shut the lights off.  The music was so clear and so beautiful.

I don't want my description to sound too euphoric, but I was experiencing the transcending effects of about 14 drinks without losing any control of thoughts or motor skills.  It was literally hapiness in a bottle, and I couldn't taste the wormwood.  I also woke with little or no hangover effects.</bodytext></report>
