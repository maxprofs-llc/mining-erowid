I started taking ginkgo because my bud smoking was doing mean things to my short term memory (actually I stoned now). 2 capsules  a day. a month later I able to recall childhood memories in way more detail(I 20), concentration has definitely improved and I feel I using a broader vocabulary in normal daily conversations (acid was the one who made me read the dictionary in the first place). Short term memory is still fucked, especially when I forget to take ginkgo for a day or maybe my keys just like playing hide and seek.</bodytext></report>
