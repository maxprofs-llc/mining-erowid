This is just a few notes about the times I have experimented with 2ci. In total I have tried it 4 times, the first time dosing 12.5mg and the rest at 15mg. Previous to trying this chemical I had many expectations from reading the reports online.

My first attempt with this chemical was quite intense as I hadn't done any psychedelics for a year or so. It wasn't a terribly strong trip but I did experience quite major feelings of not being in my body, as if the arms hanging by my side weren't mine. There was very little visual activity at this dose until we smoked some marijuana and cracked some N20 which really brought out the chemical.

At 15mg I noted more activity in the form of visuals and general headspace but nothing too intense, however it does give me and my friends the distinct feeling that no matter what we are doing we need to do something else. Similar to feeling hungry or thirsty and relieveing it however we have no idea what would relieve this feeling, but walking does help a lot and I have found that walking and chatting is one of the best things to do during the first few hours of a 2ci trip.

My main note however is that without the addition of cannabis and n20, 2ci at 15mg is not really very exciting. However after a smoke there is nothing better than getting all my trip buddies in a cosy room, dimming the lights (preferably with the addition of a plasma globe/black light etc) and getting into the n20. When I am on 2ci nitrous does not behave in the same way as when I am sober or just stoned. It is like an insta-trip, where-by I can easily control the intensity of the trip by inhaling accordingly. Visuals will suddenly reveal themselves and at times completely dominate the visual field leaving me wondering where I am and what I'm doing but then in a few minutes will gently come back to earth.

One thing to note however is that once the n20 begins the visuals remain. Even when a nitrous hit wears off the visuals remain with me for about 20mins or so. This means that for me, once I start doing nos I really begin my 2ci trip, and it is possible with the inhalation of nos every five or ten minutes to remain at a comfortable tripping level with brief periods of amazing intensity directly after inhaling. What I have found amazing every time is that while in that magical room I can feel as though I am tripping really hard, amazing visuals, hardly able to make out the faces of my friends as they morph about, but as soon as the lights come on and we get up most of the visual activity will stop and normality almost returns.

2ci does have one major drawback in my eyes and that is the stoning effect it produces which all my friends experience to some degree. It is the same feeling I get when a strong E is wearing off and I am just sort of left in a state of 'chemicalness'. The stoning effect on 2ci makes dancing a task, and conversation very awkward. I make sure to be with close friends who I trust because once in the 'room' mass confusion can occur.

I have found 2ci to be a very interesting experience so far and will continue to use it while I have access to it. For me there really is only one use for it though and that is to spend an evening with close friends at home smoking cannabis and inhaling nitrous. Without these allies it it never reaches it's full potential.

(as a side note i must mention that the 2ci we recieve is usually mixed in with a bzp/herbal 'party pill' which are easily available in my country. The supplier seems to think that alone 2ci does not offer enough energy however personally I dislike bzp and would think my supplier should have the common sense to just give us the 2ci on its own. The amount of bzp in one pill is somewhere in the ballpark of half a dose so it does not have too much effect however is definitely noticable. That said, I have had it by itself and noted little difference in effect with/without bzp)
