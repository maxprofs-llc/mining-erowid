I recently attempted suicide and failed, and ended up in the psych ward.  I have bad anxiety and it was worse there so I was on ativan 3 times daily, but it was quite ineffective.

One evening I forgot to order my usual cup of coffee with dinner, and my ativan actually worked.  So I tried not having my morning coffee with my ativan and the ativan worked again.

The caffeine was making it ineffective.  So if anyone reading this is having problems with anxiety and their benzo isn't working, try getting off of caffeine.</bodytext></report>
