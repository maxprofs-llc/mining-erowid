If that was methoxetamine I don't want to do it again! I just got my methoxetamine or MXE whatever u want to call it. And after reading up on it I tried 10 mg.

It took about 15 minutes after I snorted it it continued to come on slow then reached a plateau that kinda was resembling ketamine it was nice for about 20 minutes then I started coming down and just felt sick. If  I moved if I lay still the queasiness was gone but move at all and I felt sick like I ate too many vicodin or opiates sick. It was a nice peak but to be followed by that sickness feeling was terrible and it lasted a long time it's been four hours since I snorted it and I'm still queasy feeling.</bodytext></report>
