I have had two previous experiences with amanita mushrooms. One with freshly picked mushrooms which had no real effect. Another experience with 2 grams of 1:10 amanita extract which I had bought in a 'smartshop' resulted in mild stoning effects which left me wanting more.

This day was beautiful weather and I wanted to take a break from my job search. I decided I was going to go to the park and lie in the sun. I had made an extract of  harmala seeds. I buy half a kilogram for three bucks or so. I had extracted the seeds with water and vinegar and added table salt to get the hcl form of the alkaloids. I had left the extract in a box somewhere for half a year after using it a few times.

So I took 150 mg  of the extract (which corresponds to 3 grams of the seeds) in water which left a terrible aftertaste. I felt something coming on but it kind of subsided after a half an hour or so. I thought the material must have lost potency. So I took another 150 mg. in a capsule this time. Another buzz which subsided more or less. This was the point where I decided I still have some amanita extract somewhere, maybe it will give a nice mellow buzz to chill in the park. I took my stuff and went to the park. Downed half a gram of 1:10 amanita extract, put on my headphones, and listened to the 'red hot on impulse' jazz cd. I laid in the sun and enjoyed the feeling the small amount of amanita had added to the harmala. Sometimes I could get some minor closed eye faint visuals going, at other times I just felt very relaxed and content. No anxiety or worries which sometimes accompany psychedelics. I had a long phone conversation with a good friend, which went rather smoothly.

Maybe two or three hours after taking the amanita extract I got hungry and wanted to go home. Walking with my bike proved difficult, my coordination was off. Biking was better but I still swayed somewhat. When I got home nausea and a faint feeling overwhelmed me. I could not eat and got very drowsy. I went to bed and slept for three or more hours. The rest of the night I was nauseous and sedated. I could only entertain my evening guest lying on the floor, because standing up I would get to nauseous (we did have a good laugh about that!). The feeling reminded me very much of serotonin syndrome, which I have had before when I was on 'Effexor' (an SSRI I quit taking a year ago). Visual shaking of the surrounding reminded me of what I had had with a combination of 5-htp and iboga.

The next day I read this on the net: 'A potentially psychoactive beta-carboline compound, methyltetrahydrocarboline carboxylic acid (MCTHC; I-methyl-3-carboxyl-tetrahydro-B-carboline has been isolated in low levels from European A. muscaria (Matsumoto et al. 1963).' Maybe the compound is an mao-inhibitor? Maybe this could expain the 'serotonin syndrome' feeling? More probably harmala just enhances some aspects of amanita which can turn out not so pleasant? I just wanted to warn people who read the trip report about combining amanita with harmala (as I did), for me it was pleasant in the beginning but after about three hours it got physically very unpleasant.</bodytext></report>
