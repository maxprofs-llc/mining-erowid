After my earlier negative experiences with some other research chemicals,
/n
2C-C and 5-MeO-DiPT (Foxy Methoxy), whose heavy body load and insufficient
/n
psychedelic yield got me disappointed, I have approached this chemical
/n
with a degree of apprehension and skepticism. I needn't have to worry;
/n
this is a very gentle drug of rare beauty.
/n
/n
Xavier (my partner) and I decided to tag on an experiment with this
/n
drug to the end of our MDMA-enhanced love-making session, having just
/n
celebrated our anniversary. We were both already quite tired, but still
/n
felt we'd like to extend this wonderful night for a bit longer.
/n
/n
I decided to apply this drug by IM injection, in order to bypass the
/n
deleterious effects of the digestive tract, and to speed up the action.
/n
The drug acted quite fast, perhaps within 10 minutes, and my threshold
/n
dose was about 5mg. I was then comfortable enough to gradually increase
/n
our dose to a total of 40mg, for each of us. The dose-to-response curve
/n
was remarkably linear, gently tapering off. There was very little body
/n
load. The effects started to subside in approx one or two hours, and I
/n
have extended the duration of the trip by topping up.
/n
/n
The first thing I noticed were gentle rushes in my face, followed by
/n
altered perception of colours. It's a bit like if I turned my
/n
internal 'colour contrast' adjustment control to the max, and then some.
/n
Colours become incredibly deep and vibrant. Xavier (my partner) and I
/n
were watching a porn movie; this was turned into a piece of art, a
/n
feast to our eyes.
/n
/n
Watching Xavier's face, I saw it transformed before my eyes. He has a
/n
handsome face, with some strong features, and I saw him transformed
/n
into a Star Trek alien, then yet another type of alien, and then some
/n
strange animals, one after the other. He looked a bit scary, but I
/n
realized that I would still love him even if he remained like that.
/n
/n
Closing my eyes produced a never-ending tapestry of intricate artistic
/n
imagery which, if one was able to remember it all, would keep alive a
/n
generation of fantastic artists.
/n
/n
Interestingly though, this drug was not at all trippy in the Ketamine
/n
sense. It did not affect my mind; there were no 'conversations with
/n
gods', no funny mental loops, no time dilation. It never got scary. I didn't 
/n
actually get deeply involved in the 'action'. Rather, I was in a
/n
position of an amused, almost detached, observer. That was quite enough
/n
for me, but Xavier was somewhat disappointed, being used to a deeper
/n
involvement on Ketamine and complaining that the visuals were too
/n
weak even while he was at the peak of his experience.
/n
/n
Having said that, I did in fact notice some subtle mental cues of deeper
/n
psychedelic deja-vu of my earlier Ketamine sessions. The drug does seem
/n
able to get me close to some of the doors of higher perception, but leaves
/n
them safely shut.
/n
/n
In terms of the stimulant/depressant scale, this drug was mildly
/n
stimulant, in a peaceful, gentle way. I would imagine (as I heard) that
/n
it would make a great combo with MDMA (in our case the MDMA effect was
/n
already over). But it was not a rave club drug; I wouldn't be able to dance on it.
/n
In fact I tended to develop a slight nausea just by going to the
/n
bathroom and back, which however, quickly subsided when I got back in
/n
bed again. It was not a sensual drug; I probably couldn't have sex on it,
/n
it does not seem to enhance any erotic feelings. But if I wanted to just
/n
lie down and relax, and perhaps watch some movie, I could be sure it
/n
will become a work of art, a colourful, yet not kitchy, eye candy, while
/n
still leaving my mind intact enough to be able to follow the plot.
/n
/n
This is a successful research chemical which could in fact make it to
/n
the mainstream. It should have a street name; I'd simply call it 'Colour'.</bodytext></report>
