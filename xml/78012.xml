Ahhh spice silver, in my opinion the fucking most best stuff I've ever had.

8:00 I put about half the 400mg sachet in to two bowls of a pipe and rip them one after the other,
/n
/n
8:05 I pack two more bowls and rip them both one after the other.
/n

8:15 Wooooo! It just hit me, I look around the room I'm in, and think to my self 'Man this is amzing', I couldn't stop smiling and told my best mate what I'm feeling, he looked at me funny because he never thought it would do anything, but he was wrong, Very wrong!
/n
/n
8:25 Still can't stop smiling and saying to my mate that this is great, I stand up and it hits me more than ever, I feel like life is fucking great and everything is gonna be great and the world is an amazing place,

8:30 I go to sit down next to the computer and watch some youtube, leaning back as I watch random videos I still feel great and smiley :D
/n
/n
8:35 I can laugh at the funny videos as usual but not like cannabis were you laugh at anything its weird but in a great way, definatly reached my peak by now.
/n
/n
8:45 After feeling great or the past 3/4 of an hour things start to feel less great and back to normal, I feel like I would like some more to keep this amazing sense going but not as if I needed some.
/n
/n
9:00 Everythings fine now, I felt like I need sleep, but were all about to go out, so after a hit of real weed and things are all good again so off we go out :)

I think that this experince was an amazing one to say the least, I'm looking forward to try it again or maybee spice gold. Deffinatly not a substitute for canabis but never felt a high like it.  :D</bodytext></report>
