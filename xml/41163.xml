A few days ago, I took a journey. I traveled through a world beyond the comprehension of someone who has never had a chemical induced experience. What I saw cannot be described, but for some reason, I feel the extreme urge to try in order to help all the people out there that are thinking of trying this substance.

OK, to start off the story, this was not my first time trying salvia. I'd tried it several times before, but it had never worked like I thought it should. I'm not sure if the other stuff I was trying wasn't potent enough or if I wasn't smoking it right or what, but I'd never gotten more than just a small body buzz. But I was determined to take the trip that all these people were talking about.

It was about 8 o'clock at night and I had purchased about a gram of 20x extract from a friend of mine earlier that day. They didn't want it because it was 'too freaky.' I figured what the hell, it's cheap and it's stronger than all the other extracts I've tried, what's the harm? Boy was I in for a surprise. I was over at a friends house when I decided to pull it out. Another friend of mine had always heard about it and wanted to try it too. I'm into sharing, so I figured it would be a good idea to 'trip' with someone else.

I didn't have a pipe or bong or anything handy, so I just used a good ol' fashion can. I cut the holes and the carb and all that good stuff and packed the 'bowl' with about 3 or 4 hits worth of the good stuff. I went out onto my friends porch/dog pen and proceeded to light the bowl. I sucked on the can until I could taste the smoke and knew it was full. I released the carb, took in all the smoke, and handed it off to my fellow psychonaut.

As soon as I let out all of the smoke, I felt as if all reality had melted away and that my whole life was a big lie. All of these distorted images of my surroundings were freezing in motion and flying past me. I tried to grab onto anything I could to keep form falling, but to no avail. Keep in mind that I did not know that I fell, I was just told later.

I was no longer on that porch, but in a terrifying, swirling collage of images that were both based on reality and hallucination. I could see all things flying past my head, like a slide show moving at warp speed past my face. I saw random hands and eyes and feet and other body parts protruding through my vision, but I could only make out certain things, like my friends eyeballs and hat. Everything surrounding those was unreal to say the least. I wish I could tell you what it was, but you'd just have to see it to have some idea.

All of a sudden, I felt like this was my permanent reality, like I could never go back to what I had. I tried desperately to wake up or roll over or open my eyes. It all felt like a dream, but deep inside knew it wasn't. I was so scared, I almost pissed my pants. Then, all of a sudden, I was back out on the porch, standing with my friends, holding their hands. I felt like I'd been gone for at least a half hour
/n

Now, from what I hear from my friends, as soon as I passed the can, my eyes opened as wide as they could and I started looking around at things that (obviously) weren't there. Then, I fell off the stool and onto the chicken wire barrier and just laid there. I didn't try to get up or move or anything, I just sat on the wire with my eyes and mouth wide open. My friends both tried to help me out and that's where the holding hands part came in. As they helped my up, I hugged them and rubbed their arms and held their hands and just couldn't keep my hands to myself. Keep in mind that I couldn't even see them! I was just trying to hold onto something real, something tangible that wasn't part of my hallucination. It was friggin' crazy!

The whole experience lasted about 3 minutes, but it felt a lot longer than that. I will never forget the things I saw and I will never be able to describe them in words. If you want to have a vague idea of what I'm talking about, just go out and do it and you'll know what I'm tlaking about. There is no way to describe the incredible things you will see. No matter how scary this account might sound, I'll tell you, it was one of the most incredible, exciting, life-changing experiences I've ever had and I wouldn't hesitate to do it all over again. Go out, get some salvia, and take a trip. It's well worth your time.</bodytext></report>
