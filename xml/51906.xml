I combined 30mg of 2C-C with 20mg of 2C-E. I was going into unknown territory.  I took a precautionary Dramamine along with the dose.

Set and Setting: I was excited to be experimenting with the combination.  I stayed in my apartment the entire time.

The come-up was very jittery; far more so than either compound had been alone (I had taken 50mg 2C-C and 20mg 2C-E on two separate occasions).

I had an intense hour or so that must have been the combination peak. Everything was morphing out of control - which was cool, except that I felt too tense and jittery to enjoy it. I could feel the relaxing effect of the 2C-C, but it was almost as if it were in the background. I don't know how it's possible to feel both tense and relaxed, but I did.  My mind raced out of control; I wasn't freaking out, but I didn't feel like I was really thinking, either.  This frenetic thought pattern led to no insight.

The rest of the trip was indistinguishable from my previous 2C-E trip. The 2C-C didn't seem to have any lasting effect.

Overall, I think this combination is unnecessary. 2C-C is a decent substance in its own right, but doesn't seem to add anything useful to the 2C-E experience.

Perhaps 40mg 2C-C and 10mg 2C-E would have been better.</bodytext></report>
