I had been smoking for about a year, but recently just started to do it heavily (for about a month).  I always smoke with friends and this night we went to a party where we were not particularly welcomed with the most open arms.

After sharing the first bowl with a friend, I decided to smoke a second right after by myself.  The little hand held bubbler was hitting like crazy and I eventually had to put it down cuz I could feel my mind definitely starting to get real stoned.  I talked with my other friend and had a normal conversation until we laughed and i was laughing as hard as I ever had, having the best high experience...UNTIL I looked back up and everything came whirling around.  I was stuck in this weird reality of 'what is life?' and why are we here and what about death and all those thoughts and I started to become horrified, everything from then on was dream-like and just an absolute nightmare...I've been too scared to smoke since then (about a week)  because I do not want to experience that ever again.</bodytext></report>
