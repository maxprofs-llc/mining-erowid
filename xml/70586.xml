I was on my home, it was the 10 a.m. Instead taking my usual vitamin/mineral/ginseng combo, I decided dont do it. It was a very rainy day and I'm too constipated to go to the pharmacys faculty of the Universitat de Barcelona as every day. I have some tryptamines that I bought some months ago, some of them even a year or two, on various reputated research chemicals sellers. One of them is the apreciated 5-MeO-DiPT. It passed more than a year since last time I took this sexy tryptamine. In the past it was my most appreciated aphrodisiac, and I took it more than 50 times on a 6 month period. I decided to do a short-time experiment taking various little 1mg insufflated doses, waiting the first milligram coming on, before taking the next.

[10:30] 1 mg of  the purest superwhite transparent crystals is insufflated.As you can supose, I felt nothing.

[T+0:10] It passed 10 minutes since the first milligram, and I redose insufflating another milligram. I feel some enhancing on colors, some effects reminiscent of tryptamines, but almost unnoticeable.

[T+0:20] Another milligram of Foxy Methoxy is insufflated. I start to feel like a mix of a tryptaminic state and a nootropic state. Its not the first time I feel it. I think some tryptamines at low dosages can act as nootropics. Now Im feeling a (+).

[T+0:30] Another milligram insufflated. Because I dont feel the usual anxiety associated with the onset of this substance, I continued my experiment redosing a milligram, reaching 4 milligrams, that, beeing insufflated, equal to 6 or 7 oral milligrams. I start to feel a little contemplative, and surprisingly I have less anxiety than 30 minutes before. I played chill out music, that sounds sublime, and find myself seeing the rain and thinking Wow, I feel so good just seeing the water drops falling of the sky and hearing chill out music.

[T+0:40]

Now, Im in an antidepresive state, peaking the experience, in which I dont need to see what time is it, because I havent any anxiety. I have reached the (++) in the Shulgins scale. If I analyze my state from an ayurvedic point of view, I feel that 5-MeO-DiPT at this dosage have balanced my Sadhaka pitta and Prana vata. Less impulsivity and less anxiety. More balanced feelings and emotions, and a sexy state of mind. A fresh and smooth tryptaminic state of mind, although it wasnt a really psychedelic state at this dosage.

[T+1:30] I returned to baseline in just 1 hour since the last milligram insufflated. I smoke a little marijuana (that clouded  my mind a little, normal effect with some tryptamines) and eat some food that tasted marvelous. It was a short-time, although refresher experience.</bodytext></report>
