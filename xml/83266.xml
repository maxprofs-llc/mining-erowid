I have recently been getting Nucynta both 75mg and 50mg. It is compared to vicodin but alot stronger. I usually have to take about 40mg of oc to get a big nod til I can't keep my eyes open any longer. I only have to take two 75mg pills to get messed up which is good because I only pay 1 dollar a piece. Gives me a good sense of well being and takes care of my opiate cravings for up to 8 hours.

The main thing I like about these besides the price is that I can stop taking them without having wd if any wd it is very small compared to the others - oc, vicodin, morphine.</bodytext></report>
