desoxypipradrol, marijuana, beer, &amp; NBOMe-mescaline combo trip report
/n
/n
I'm a mid-20's male. I've done many tryptamines and phenethylamines. I've done 2-DPMP about 3 or 4 times before up to about 6mg. I've experimented with NBOMe-mescaline intranasally up to about 50mg, with little to no effects so far.
/n
/n
9:00 AM
/n
I've been awake for 14 hours. Just snorted ~3mg desoxypipradrol because I have to stay awake and get stuff done.
/n
/n
9:06 AM
/n
it's surprising to me, but I feel more awake and alert and less tired.
/n
/n
9:10 AM
/n
I think I could fall asleep if I tried.
/n
/n
1:00 PM
/n
Not feeling tired anymore after 4 hours from lift off. No euphoria. I smoke some weed (schwag) every few hours.
/n
/n
I went to sleep about 5:00-5:30 PM, then was awakened and almost immediately snorted another ~3mg of 2-DPMP. Going camping now...
/n
/n
7:00 PM (approx.)
/n
Starting with a weighed out bag with 90mg of NBOMe-mescaline in it. I put about 40mg of the NBOMe under the tongue. And some weed is smoked after that. Just a bowl, but dank this time.
/n
/n
I start thinking: What a fucking fool I am! I'm taking a virtually unknown substance at a dosage only reported once (first hand) before. That after I've had no sleep and I've been up way too long, and I'm mixing it with 2-DPMP. How fucking foolish. I wish I hadn't done that. But I did, so let's hope for the best, eh?
/n
/n
After about 30 minutes, I'm feeling pretty good. Different, things look strange, like a new land is all around me.
/n
/n
7:45 PM (approx.)
/n
I put another maybe 20mg smeared around under my tongue and left to absorb.
/n
/n
About 8:15 PM the final ~30mg was snorted, feeling very good. Some euphoria reminiscent of MDMA, talking is increased. It's not the beer.
/n
/n
~8:30 PM
/n
I'm looking at the sun set, and storm clouds far away. Looking at intricate ripples in the lake water, colored by the sunset. The visual stuff has started. I remember saying to myself that what I see is beautiful. I'm feeling pretty good.
/n
/n
at 10:00 PM it's fully developed, drinking beer before this even started, but I'm not really drunk or not very drunk if I am drunk. Been smoking pot (schwag) too, all day actually.
/n
/n
At 11:00 PM
/n
this is probably the peak
/n
/n
~2:00 AM, I go walking. It's a full moon. I'm kind of drunk now. Trying to pay attention to the effects of the NBOMe-mescaline, taking mental notes on this trip.
/n
/n
There's brilliant visual stuff with eyes closed, of a different composition than I'm used to with 2C- type psychedelic drugs. The visions are not very clear, pretty muddy, but there are flashes of color and awesome looking stuff, hard to describe. Like an abstract painting being created before my eyes. This is not the classic kaleidoscope patterning type stuff though.
/n
/n
With eyes open... looking across a lake at houses on the hill. It's beautiful. Lights are jumping around from their source to various points in my field of vision. This is some nice, nice stuff. Tracers follow most things that move, but they are not heavy tracers like with DPT. The tracers follow their source, but they seem to jump around as well, especially if I move my gaze to another location. This stuff's got potential for greatness, seriously.
/n
/n
4:00 AM
/n
I'm tripping still.
/n
/n
Appetite was good, but I hadn't eaten much during the day.
/n
/n
The total trip was around 10 hours, but I was still feeling little bits of it at 12-13 hours from when I dosed the first bit of it. Then it's gone. No nausea. No body load that I noticed at all.
/n
/n
Must sleep... Falling asleep in car on the way home. Slept about 8 hours. Feeling fine the next day.
/n
/n
About 24 hours after taking the NBOMe-mescaline, there are still some nice visuals that come rather suddenly and then leave within minutes. This only happened once. I would almost call these 'flashbacks', but I don't believe in such fairy tales and have never experienced a 'flashback'.
/n
/n
This is an interesting compound and it deserves more research.
