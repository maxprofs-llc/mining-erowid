I purchased some of this rare and expensive herb, from a good source, who's website offers Sage Wisdom, along with their products.

I had read elsewhere on the net, that boiling it in slightly acidic water, will help to extract the active ingredient. So, I added a little apple-cider vinegar, to a large plastic mug of about 20 oz. of water, and put it in the microwave until it was boiling. I then put some of the Lagochilus inebrians in a plastic tea strainer (holds about as much as a tea bag), put it into the mug, and then covered it for about 15 minutes. I then sat down and drank it slowly, because it was still very hot. The effects began about an hour later, and lasted about 4-5 hours. Inebriated is a good way to describe the way I felt. It wasnt bad at all, and left me very relaxed but alert, with no bad aftereffects. I slept well that night, and the next day, it seemed that I felt a bit more calm and relaxed than usual.

However, the next weekend, I tried preparing it, and found no effects at all. After waiting for 3 hoursnothing. So, I tried again, with more herb. Four hours laternothing. I couldnt figure it out! Then I tried again, but this time, for every sip I took, I held it in my mouth for about a minute. Well, an hour later, and I was inebriated again! Ive read of other peoples failures with this herb, and thought that they just didnt get the real stuff, but now I think I understand what is the problem. The active ingredient is apparently absorbed sublingually!</bodytext></report>
