One day I was chilling with my cousin and I was like, man Im bored, and he asked if I had 15 dollars. I had 20, and although we both smoked real bud he was on probation, so got his dads girlfriends daughter to take us to this store to get some fake weed.

We bought some stuff called G7 potpourri. It doesnt sound as powerful as k2 and as soon as we got to his place, we rolled it up and I took about 7 big hits.

I felt good when we went back inside, but 5 or 6 minutes later I was trippin hard. Time went by so slow I forgot who I was, where I was and what I did, and even who my cousin was that Ive known all my life. I just forgot who he was.

It lasted bout 4 hours but I lived and enjoyed it and now I know how to handle it.</bodytext></report>
