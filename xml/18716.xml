I once had a similar story to the guy who was pulled over by the cops [/n], but due to his rights didn't have to have his car searched.

This happened back in '87 when I was a mere 25 years old.  I was out with two other friends and I was driving.  Friend 1--J--and I were indulging in some pot and each drinking a 40-ounce Olde English.  Friend 2--C--had recently gotten clean due to some bad experiences but wanted to come along for the ride.  At some point I had to pull over to take a leak (around midnight, out in the sticks) and as I'm standing there I noticed THE MAN pull up near my car.  Well....in my mind I'm thinking, 'Shit!  My car smells like pot and I've got several opened 40-ouncers!  This is bust material!'  Earlier, I was feeling pretty great but suddenly now I'm practically sober, yet my eyes are pretty red.  Anyways, the officer asks me what I'm doing there and I reply, 'I'm sorry, sir, but I really needed to water the bushes and didn't see any other place I could do so.'  He notices my red eyes and asks what that's about.  I said, 'Well....I've had a long drive today, it's almost midnight and I'm rather tired and I'm in the process of heading home.'  Looking at my car with my two idiot-looking friends inside, the officer then asks if he can check my car out.

At this point I'm thinking I have two options.  One:  like an idiot, I could tell him, 'Yeah, sure...No problem!' and then watch as I get hauled away, or.....Two:  play him and see what happens.  I chose door number two and bravely said, 'Not unless you have a search warrant.'  I saw both my friends' mouths drop as I stood there waiting for the cop's response.  To my relief, all he said was, 'Well, then get in your car and be on your way.'  I cooly walked to my car, got in, started her up and left.  Immediately I asked my sober friend what the speed limit was, he told me and I made sure the speedometer didn't stray from that speed and also made sure I was inside the line.  I watched the rear-view mirror, noticing the cop following me, waiting for me to make a mistake so he could really pull me over!  Thankfully, as I entered onto the freeway the cop continued on down the country road.

At the time I considered that incident to be a lucky situation (there's no telling how another cop might have acted), however, I do believe that it was within my right to state that he could not search my car without probable cause.  Just because my eyes were red didn't mean I was ripped (and I acted pretty sober according to my friends who were watching the whole scenario).

Just remember to play it cool if you're ever in a similar situation.
