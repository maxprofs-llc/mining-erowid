One large bottle of barefoot Merlot, three bass ales, three shots of Jameson, one shot of Jagermeister, one shot of goldschlager, put me in the ER for gastritis.  I was unconscious and vomiting for about 16 hours.  When I woke, I just could not stop vomiting and hiccuping.  I went to the ER eventually.  The doc told me I'd burned away the inner layer of my stomach.  I couldn't eat solid food for a week.  The hiccups left a sharp pain in my solar plexus every time I swallowed.

After this experience my sleeping schedule reversed so that I was up all night and asleep during the day.  I ended up on Zoloft and mood stabilizers after this experience.  I took them for about a year while abstaining from alcohol.  They worked.

I just got off the Zoloft recently and had my first drink in about a year.  I never drink more than one drink in one day now.  That is my new rule.  If I break it, I'm done.  I never want to go through that experience again.  I nearly died from that experience.</bodytext></report>
