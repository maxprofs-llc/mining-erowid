I've had yohimbe tea a few times. The more teaspoons, the stronger the results. The result from tea seems distinguished from that of the alcohol extract. Better results when boiling for a short amount of time, as longer times seem to reduce potency.

The tea makes me an altered-sexual beast. Not quite hallucinating but homed in on a primal sexuality that women seem to notice. Strong erection. At the time, I had a problem with sweating and yohimbe seemed to have exacerbated it. I feel a little hostile and aggressive, which I like feeling. My eyes become very red. Visine helps, if I want to conceal some of the beast I've become.

I made an alcohol extract once steeped for just over 2 weeks and once for over a month. It was done in Everclear both times. To get any results, I generally needed at least a shot. However, I mostly felt paranoid and although psyched for sex, I did not get the benefits that the tea gave me.

I conclude that the active components conferring improved libido and sexuality are water soluble. As Everclear (California legal) variety is mostly alcohol, this model seems to fit the results I've experienced.</bodytext></report>
