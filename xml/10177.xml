I had previously tried the chew them up and swallow method of ingesting morning glory seeds and ended up puking them up and laying in bed as if I had the flu for several hours.  So I decided to extract the LSA from the seeds and give that a try.  I used the method described in the Morning Glory FAQ, substituting the petrolum ether with FM&amp;P Naphtha.

I drank the solution which contained about 430 seeds in hopes of having a psychedelic experience.  I felt rather drunk at first and then started to feel odd.  I found myself pacing back and forth across the room eventually runnning into the bathroom just in time to puke my stomach dry.  After I heaved about 4 times I drank a glass of water and then puked again with one heave.  I noticed that my nose was burning and that was due to the everclear/LSA puke dripping out of my nose... I love this substance.  I cleaned out my nose by snorting water and spitting it into the sink and then shloshed my mouth out with lots of water.

I then heated up a cup of noodles and turned on my computer.  I am now typing this up, so people can read this and I figured the sooner the better.  I don't know how this substance is supposed to work, but I just got light headed and puked.  Maybe I'm allergic to it or something.  Anyway this sucks!</bodytext></report>
