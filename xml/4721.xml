I wanted to tell you about my Yohimbe experience...Ive ordered 100g of the herb in a online shop. Originally I wanted to try it with my GF, but after some time I decided to try it with a friend first. Weve tried many sorts of all possible drugs, but this time we experienced something we were not expecting.

We made 500ml tea and drank it with sugar at 23:00 oclock. 40 minutes later I noticed the herb starting to work. My feet got warm and my back was tingeling. I also had problems walking because my feet felt kinda strange, it was like I was wearing really heavy boots. My perception changed and I started to see flashes and shit like that. I got kinda scared because that was completly different from what I have been expecting.

We went back to my appartament and I took a look in the mirror...My eyes were completly red and small, just like after heavy THC smoking. That scared me too because my friends pupils were dilated and his eyes were open wide. We decided to go to bed, because the experience started to get more and more unpleasant. But just after switching the light off I got something that was similar to a bad trip on MDMA. Something was happening in my brain and I started to think that Ive seriously have done something to me and that I probably wont make it through the night. My friend was feeling the same. This really shitty feeling left for T +3 hours. At 3 in the night the effects slightly went away, but we were not able to sleep the whole night.

So, this shit was not stimulating at all, just a shitty feeling in the body. Not worth the money...</bodytext></report>
