Often, I seem to somehow run out of benzo's and opiates at the same time.  Once in a while I try to remedy the opiate pains with tramadol.  Bad idea.  I knew that the threshold for seizures was raised with use of tramadol, but when in that pain I often ignore common sense and medical knowledge.  I made this mistake and ended up taking 400mg of ultram.  Hell, maybe I would have seized either way, but I ended having a seizure after eating the ultram.</bodytext></report>
