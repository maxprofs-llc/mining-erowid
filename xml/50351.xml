When I was 17, I had a nervous breakdown of sorts. I was due to go to the psychward, and the night before I smoked some bunk weed (didn't do anything to me), and I ingested around a box of coricidin. The following day I was admitted into a psychward, and as part of the whole process I was tested for drugs. I tested positive for PCP, and I'm pretty sure I had none. I'm almost certain that it was a false positive.</bodytext></report>
