T+0 mins - I had a bunch of herbs and legal highs lying around, stuff that I'd ordered from online or that I was growing myself. The catnip I had lying around from when I last harvested my plant and left out to dry, which it now was, so I decided to try smoking it for the first time. I sat down and smoked six bowls of it mixed with tobacco in a row, and felt reasonably intoxicated. The smoke was pleasant and smooth, did not make me want to hack up a lung like weed does, but then I don't get along well with Marijuana. Nothing as strong as weed, and there were no real mental affects, but it was definitely relaxing and pleasant.

T+20 mins - The effects were noticeably tapering off, and I decided I wanted a bit more, so I dug through my 'intoxicants drawer' and pulled out various items, most too strong for what I was after, but I found about 1/3rd of a 15g bottle of Blue Lotus and a baggie of 'Algerian Blend' which I ordered from an online store. The Algerian Blend was a mix of herbs, including Damiana, Skullcap, Wormwood, Wild Opium Lettuce, Passion Flower and Valarian.

So I took these, with the Catnip, and added 2 tablespsoons of both the Catnip and the Algerian Blend, and emptied to container of Blue Lotus into my coffee perculator. To that I added warm water and stirred constantly for ten minutes, as I had read that warm water is better than hot water due to the latter destroying some of the alkaloids. I then let it sit for another five minutes and poured it into a cup, added milk and three teaspoons of sugar.

T+35 mins - I sipped this slowly for the next ten minutes, allowing it to sit beneath my tongue for a little while and absorb sublingually before swallowing it. The taste wasn't too bad, I recognised the bitter taste of Blue Lotus (I had made a tea of this before), but the minty flavour of the Catnip overrode most of it. The Algerian Blend had little or no effect on the taste, because I couldn't pick out anything either positive or negative from it. The catnip buzz was still present at this stage, but only really noticeable if I focused. Still very relaxed though.

T+45 mins - Starting to feel the effects of the tea. Very relaxed, time seems to be going slower, the music I'm listening to (Hard House) sounds silky and beautiful. I feel a slight tingly rush in my chest when I breathe in deeply.
/n
/n
T+50 mins - Noting a slight stimulation along with the depressant effects. I feel quite sleepy and dreamy, but at the same time terribly alert. I feel like getting up and dancing to my music. I am writing this report and working on an essay at the same time. I am not having any trouble with either, in fact it makes it easier to focus on the essay because I am having fun without having to do anything else.
/n
/n
T+55 mins - I feel at peace, a very slight sensation of Euphoria. Breathing deep is beautiful, I can't help but close my eyes when I do and listen to the silky beats of my music. There is a very slight, almost imperceptable echo to the music as well. This feels very reminiscent of the time I made a tea of 10g Blue Lotus, only it seems to be potentiated by the other herbs, more euphoria, more tingling, yet the other herbs put a definite spin on it. It is quite interesting, not mild, but not too strong either. I can easily get on with my work still.

T+1 hr 5 mins - Seems as though this experience has peaked, I guess we shall see soon. Moderate euphoria, sleepiness has increased, a heaviness of the limbs and my eyes go in and out of focus occasionally. Music sounds utterly brilliant. The stimulant effects seem to have worn off, I don't feel like dancing anymore, more than content to sit in my chair and bop along to the music. A little harder to work on my assignment now, and I'm starting to get a bit hungry, not sure if this has to do with the herbs or not though.

/n
T+1 hr 10 mins - Got up to reheat some left over pizza, felt like walking in slow motion with my heavy limbs. I knew I wasn't, and there were no visual distortions that made it look like that, merely a trick on the brain.
/n
/n
T+1 hr 35 mins - Watched an episode of Family Guy while I was eating, seemed less funny than it usually does. Effects gradually began tapering off over this time, to the point where all that remained was a slight buzz and sedation.
/n
/n
T+2 hrs - Virtually at baseline. There is a very slight sedation, possibly a hangover effect. It is neither unpleasant nor pleasant, just feels like I haven't really had enough sleep.
/n
/n
T+3 hrs - All effects have entirely dissipated, including any feelings of sedation.

Conclusion:
/n
All in all a pleasant experience. Nothing strong or mindblowing, it is very subtle and is only pleasurable if you concentrate on its effects, or you are after something mild. It's the kind of high you need to spend time approaching to get any effects, it doesn't really approach you. Kind of like a cammomile tea with a kick I suppose, much more useful for a Shaman than a Psychonaut, or anyone wanting some kind of a recreational high. Definitely wouldn't be any good for a night out, although music sounded great and I felt like dancing, if I was out in a nightclub/at a rave the overwhelming intensity and swarms of people certainly would have nullified the mild effects. I will likely revisit this experience in the future when I want to meditate or relax.</bodytext></report>
