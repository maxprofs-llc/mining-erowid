I decided to pick up a tea that contained herbs which had sedative and anxiolytic properties &amp; selected 'Traditional Medicinals - Easy Now'. Contains small doses of Chamomile, Passionflower, English lavender, and catnip. Intentions for consuming were to lower symptoms of Generalized Anxiety disorder.

Boiled water and added herbs - steeped for 15+ minutes. Drank black and drank all of it with the span of 10 minutes.  Ate 3/4 of %55 cocoa dark chocolate ('Equal Exchange' fair trade), while sipping tea.

Mindset prior to ingestion was relatively neutral. Slept less than normal amount of hours (less than 6).

After ingestion was a significant calming.

Walked to campus and attended class.

Combination of sedative herb and prior sleepiness may have synergized as I felt quite tired during that lesson. Went home and napped of tiredness. Woke up feeling refreshed, not noticable side-effects; tea is sipped less than 4 times per day.
