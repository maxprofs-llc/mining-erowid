I had written this over the period of a few months back in 2005-2006. I have sat on it since then, and though it is still somewhat incomplete I think it's finally time to share... I hope it can find some use here.

A COLLECTION OF EXPERIENCES
/n
2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine (2-CE)
/n
/n
FOREWORD:
/n
This is a collection of low to moderate dose experiences with the phenethylamine 2-CE (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine). Subject has been experimenting with such doses to find not only an accepted threshold, but also an acceptable dose that could be used for therapeutic purposes. The intent therefore, is not to describe or report a full psychedelic experience, but analyze less pronounced affects of the drug at certain doses and find a range which could be considered comfortable for use in everyday situations and life. The individual reports presented here are not comprehensive, but are meant to portray certain highlights as well as an adequate description of expected effects at increasing dosage levels. Not all sessions which were documented are included in this report, rather individual sessions have been selected as displaying typical results from a given dosage level. Reports of doses above 20mg are excluded as well, as the general effects remain fairly consistent, only increasing in intensity.  Above this level, words lose their meanings and descriptions are far from accurate. 
/n
/n
SUBJECT:
/n
Subject in these experiments can be described as male, age 20, weighing about 150lbs. Subject would describe his overall psychedelic experience as moderate to high. In each of these cases, subject has fasted approximately 6-12 hours before ingestion of substance. 	
/n
/n
DOSAGE:	
/n
The subject was administered doses of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine in individual session beginning at 2.5mg. The dose for each session was gradually increased at a rate of approximately 2.5mg to a maximum of 30mg.
/n
/n
SETTING:
/n
Setting used, unless otherwise noted, is subjects home. Set and setting seem to play a major effect on this drugs potency, thus, an uncontrolled or unfamiliar environment may add a significant factor to these findings.
/n
/n
TIMEFRAME: 
/n
All tests included in this report were administered over an approximately eight-month period from July 2005 to March, 2006. The beginning smaller doses were administered in regular weekly intervals. At higher doses however this became increasingly impossible and the time between doses was increased to allow for adequate recovery and reflection between experiences.

VII.  October 21, 2005 (15mg)
/n
T+00:00 Subject ingested 15mg 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine (2-CE) 	
/n
/n
T+01:00 Subject has reached a distinct +1. The effects of the substance are beginning to take effect. No pronounced effects as of yet, but slight floating feeling with some strange sensations and pulsing energies running throughout the body.
/n
/n
T+01:15 First closed-eyed-visualizations (CEVs) noticed.
/n
/n
T+01:30 Clear open-eye-visualizations (OEVs) noticed at this point. Have reached a very distinct +2. Impaired motor skills and lack of verbal expression apparent.
/n
/n
T+01:45 OEVs taking control, still able to distinguish between chemical and reality, but it is becoming more difficult. Music and other stimuli are becoming increasingly forceful and at times nearly overwhelming. OEVs can be described as extremely geometrical and fractaline.
/n
/n
T+02:00 seemingly impossible that only fifteen minutes have passed since my last entry. Complete loss of time perception. Subject has quickly reached a +3 level, and felt in danger of falling asleep. More realistically, he was in danger of falling awake, or into prolonged periods of awareness.
/n
/n
T+03:00 After initial comeup, subject has regained much more control (if not composure) over motor functions. Still many irregularities occur. Many visual and auditory stimuli much more enhanced than normal, some causing subject to become unnecessarily startled. Overall however, very tranquil, natural effects felt. Visualizations (both CEV and OEV) occur, more frequently and intensely when focused upon. At this point, subject can control much of the chemicals effect, but when allowed to they will completely overrun both visual and mental fields.
/n
/n
T+03:45 Peak seems to have been reached, though effects remain very strong, especially when environment or situations change.
/n
/n
T+06:30 Physical effects finally noticeably diminished. Still many tracers and other small imperceptions in visual field noticed, but no major hallucinations. CEVs still incredibly prominent, and prolonged meditation leads to many worlds, hidden behind one another, all within the mind.
/n
/n
T+07:00 Subject feels much more stable than perhaps one hour ago. Back down to still a heavy +1 level. Thinking is becoming clearer, though still very mentally active. Mind and body are fatigued, but refreshed. It seems as though much in the mind has been dismantled, completely picked apart, and reassembled.
/n
/n
T+09:30 Finally back down to nearly baseline. Subject was able to conduct business he had delayed throughout the day with no problems. Mind thinking clearly, though perhaps just a bit foggy or tired from the day. Slight (almost imperceptible) headache noticed, subject believes to possibly be from lack of fluid or food intake throughout the day. Nothing major.
/n
/n
T+10:30 Subject will now take a light meal, finds himself quite hungry. Completely back to baseline now, almost no or no perceptible residual effects at this time. Body and mind feel wonderful, as if after a day of vigorous exercise. Afterglow remains, as the sun sets, subject finds a special, calming beauty in the close of this day.
/n
/n
T+13:30 Ready for sleep, still a little antsy and some achy muscles, but no real side effects or residual effects noticed.

CONCLUSIONS AND QUALITATIVE:
/n
Through these experiments, I have determined a threshold dose of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine (2-CE) to be approximately 4mg or just below, remaining in accordance with Shulgins findings reported in PiHKAL. On occasions when less than 5mg were ingested, little or no effects were felt. 
/n
/n
Therapeutic use may be possible within the 5mg -7.5 or 8mg range. Doses above this level became increasing harder to control, and pulled the subject ever farther from the physical plane. At this level it is usually possible to grain great insight (provided it is used in the correct mind set), yet allow the subject to remain comfortably situated and continue with daily tasks. Also, at this level creativity, lucidity, and energy are enhanced just enough to provide results, yet do not distract or overly intoxicate. 
/n
/n
The effects of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine (2-CE) in the 5mg - 7.5mg range remained very controlled though pronounced. Visual effects of this dose were minimal, including perhaps a short period of OEVs and visual distortions, though mostly unnoticed unless focused upon. The mind however was defiantly still effected. In this dose range, subject consistently reported overall feeling of oneness or unity to something higher. Also, feelings of something beyond the physical plane were often felt at this dose, though nothing seemed to surface. 
/n
/n
Above 8mg, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine (2-CE) produced much more pronounced effects and a slightly longer duration. OEVs became much more prevalent, especially with doses towards 10mg. Mental effects were much more forceful, though were easily controlled in most cases. Fatigue and body load became more of an issue here, though still nothing major. Subject reported slight headache or sore muscles on some occasions, and believes this to possibly be the effect of jaw clenching during the experience. 
/n
/n
Above 10mg, the effects of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine (2-CE) constituted more of a full psychedelic experience. Along with a longer duration (7-8 hours), both visual and mental effects became much more pronounced. If 5mg is the accepted threshold does of 2-CE, I would suggest 10mg to be the threshold to the next level. Doses of less than 10mg seemed to hold the subject fully on the physical plane, yet a dose just above consistently produced a +2, and at times even a strong +3 level. Visual sensations became much more pronounced, sometimes manifesting with full fractal hallucinations, color distortions, and changes in linear perspective.
/n
/n
At 15mg - 20mg, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine (2-CE) began to produce increasingly strong effects, especially during the coming up stages and the peak of the experience. Effects lasted much longer, sometimes well past ten hours, but more consistently around eight or nine. Here a major shift in mental perspective is noted. Where lower doses produced feelings of lucidity and a higher connection, here these feeling became more permanent. The subject often walked away from experiences fully reconstructed (mentally), and may have longer-term residual mental changes. Also, at this dosage level, auditory sensations bring a much stronger impact. While at lower doses the subject may have found increased appreciation of music and other stimuli, here the entire auditory field began to break down, and subject has reported to seemingly be able to hear every tiniest sound around him within a great distance. This also seemed to be the longest lasting effect of the drug, sometimes stretching into the 10-12 hour range, well after other effects had diminished.
/n
/n
Above 20mg, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine (2-CE) produced incredibly intense and at times uncontrollable effects. Effects lasted increasingly longer, usually well past ten hours, and even into the 12 hour range. At this dose, 2-CE tended to consistently produce strong +3 levels, and at times feelings bordering on the magical +4.	
/n
/n
At or above 25mg, complete ego loss was reported, and doses of 30mg and above were at times very frightening. It is very hard to accurately describe effects at this dosage level, as they become increasingly strong and unpredictable. Subject exercises caution when dosing at this level, and started off at a lower dose to have some idea of the drugs effects and to estimate personal reactions beforehand.</bodytext></report>
