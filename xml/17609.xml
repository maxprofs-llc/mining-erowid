I have extracted many drugs using isoprypol alcohol such as tryptamines, kava root, and morning glory seed powder. Almost all produced good effects (except kava root...too weak for me) so I decided to try to extract ginko. The result was about 400 mg of a tar like substance with clear crystals. When it was all dried out I smoked 30 mg's and ate the rest.

About 30 min. later I began to feel really euphoric. I smoked three pinch bowls of cannibus to greater increase the effects (since this is the nature of mary jane in any case). I felt as if I was on an acid trip without the visuals or any hallucinating. All that was present was the euphoria and insight. I felt 100 times smarter and more confident of myself. Results were, unique. I had fun.</bodytext></report>
