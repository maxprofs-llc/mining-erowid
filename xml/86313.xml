I have been smoking cannabis for about 3 years. I would consider myself a very heavy smoker, (at least once a day) and I have been consuming marijuana at this rate for about a year. Recently my phone broke and I was not able to get in contact with my dealer for a while. I decided to try some incense.

I weighed out .5 grams on my digital scale and packed it into my bong. .5 is roughly the dose I use when smoking cannabis alone. I have heard that the JWH-018 chemical in spice is stronger than THC but I was not worried.

After smoking about half of the bowl I was feeling very high. The high was exactly like cannabis at first.

At this point I started to feel some mild stomach discomfort. I was very very very high. Mild auditory hallucinations were noticeable. I have never had this experience with marijuana.

My heart was beating very fast at this point and I was beginning to worry. I laid down in bed and began to take deep breaths which slowed my heart beat a little. I put my hand on my heart and it felt as if my heart were bursting out of my chest. I started to imagine that my ribcage was broken and my heart was being stabbed by the shattered ribs. I could feel the sharp edges of my shattered ribs through my skin. I was terrified.

At this point I fell asleep.

I woke up to find my ribs fully intact and my heart was beating at a very normal rate. Apparently this drug is not for me.</bodytext></report>
