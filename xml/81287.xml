I don't have much to say about the psychological effects of MDMA that hasn't been said many times already.  HOWEVER after trying ecstasy for the first time last night I can offer the following suggestion to all up-and-coming vocalists and singers.

40 minutes after popping the pill I was in PRIME form; I actually couldn't bring myself to stop singing because of how effortless it felt.  My diaphragm had relaxed completely and the smooth breaths I was drawing were released as impeccably even tones, even as we all were striding along the street rather quickly.  I have been trained classically for 8 years and consider my voice quality to be quite good.  But without a doubt, last night was probably the best I have ever sung.

This morning I still have a looseness in my core.  My breathing muscles seem as relaxed as they have ever been, and while I think that last night's singing success can be partly attributed to the methamphetamines most E is cut with, I am positive that the MDMA itself had the greatest effect.
