Last night I tried 12 mg 2C-C orally. Oddly, this was stronger than the 15 mg insufflated that I did for my first experience. I had taken 35 mg methadone at about 5:30 am, then worked on some tree trimming all morning, got paid about 4:00 pm and by 5:00 I did my first shot of heroin. My tolerance is such that this shot only made me feel normal, no intoxication. At 5:30 I took the 12 mg 2C-C.

Pretty much nothing but mild stimulation for 2 hrs, some relaxation and empathic feelings with slight visuals at the 3 hr point. About the time I had peaked I left my friend J's house, hopped in the car, pulled out in front of a cop and was immediately pulled over. I had weed, AMT and 2C-T-21 on me, but for some reason didn't panic. I said something like ' I'msorrysirImisjudgedhowfastyouweregoingI'msorryI'musuallymorecareful' and amazingly he said 'Have a good night, be careful.'

I then drove very carefully to my friend B's house and hung out there smoking weed until I was nearly sober. We had long animated discussions about our experiences with various psychedelics and I felt very clear-headed and social.

I drove home about 10:30, felt perfectly clear and sober but vision is still slightly altered. Once home I inject the rest of my impure Mexican Tar heroin and read some trip reports. This shot I felt a little, and with the help of a little weed and 10 mg Ambien at 11:00 I am sound asleep by midnight.

It is very interesting that I had such a noticeable 2C-B-like effect this time when I barely felt a larger insufflated dose last week. Perhaps it has something to do with all the low dose AMT I've been doing every day as an antidepressant, or perhaps I just needed to learn this material.</bodytext></report>
