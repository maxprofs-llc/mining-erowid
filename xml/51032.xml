Taking 4 15 mg capsules will make me stupified for about 3 hours until I stay asleep.

I originally was prescribed these to get off percocet from an ATV accident.  I told the doctor I couldn't sleep after he cut me off the pain meds so he gave me a script for 20 of the 15 mg tablets.  I didn't fill it at first until I heard that Temazepam is a benzo drug and I find it to be nice.

It is also a great way to sleep through the sweaty withdrawal from opiods.</bodytext></report>
