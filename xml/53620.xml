i have stumbled upon something special, something very very special. i went to a psy-trance party a few days ago, before we went there, we drank some wine, smoked a few joints, but when we arrived at the party (+- 18:00) we had become pretty much sober, so we popped some ephedra. meanwhile we went on a hunt for lsd, but after asking around, none was found. there was one guy who sold mdma tablets, he said they contained 140 mg of MDMA, so we decided it was better than nothing (what we really wanted was some acid, liquid preferably, cuz we'd only done blotters), so we all swallowed one tablet (+- 20:00), it came on pretty fast (+- 20:15), and at around 20:30 we were all rolling pretty well, it did seem to be around 140 mgs of MDMA, and just when it had kicked in, a friend of mine came up to me and told me he found a guy who had some liquid, when we heard this we freaked, everything seemed to fall into place, the evening seemed to become perfect.

we went outside to a parking lot, and there we all got 1 drop of liquid, at this time all of us were rolling pretty heavily, and we were really enthousiastic about our first time doing liquid. (this was around 21:00)

after this me and my friends went back to the dancefloor, danced for a while, the acid came on really really slow, very sneaky. it seemed liquid was a lot more spiritual and clean than blotter acid, but the visuals were kind of disappointing for me, even after 2 hours, SWIBL ran into the dealer around 00:00 just after the party was 'officially' finished, the dealer asked me how the acid was, so i told him it was nice, but a bit disappointing, the dealer told me i was in luck, cuz he still had 1 drop of liquid left in the bottle, and he gave this to me, for free.

we heard that the party would go on, but the E was pretty much worn off, and we were a bit exhausted, so we went to a friend's place to chill, when i arrived there the acid had become pretty intense, but in a very easily managable way, so\ we decided to take some 4-aco-mipt, 7 mgs to be precise, though i and my friends didn't know if it was safe to combine miprocetin with MDMA or acid, we didn't know of anyone else ever combining any of these with 4-aco-mipt, and the internet wasn't working, so we couldn't check if anyone had done it before.
/n

This is where the real fun started, the 4-aco-mipt started to kick in around 01:45, and right away I and my friend were tripping balls(the other guy didn't want to risk the combination), and the acid took really long to kick in, it kicked in after we took the miprocetin. the 4-aco-mipt merged perfectly with the acid. words cannot describe the perfection of this combination, all SWIBL can say is that 4-aco-mipt and LSD are a very good and powerful match. The visuals were everywhere where SWIBL looked and they were beautiful.

I and my friends walked around town for a while (the town was completely deserted), and we went to a park, all the time SWIBL had the feeling he was walking in wonderland, and it looked like it too, and the audio hallucinations were insane, music sounded really beautiful.

after this we went home and I tripped balls till 10:00 when I fell asleep, I slept 3 hours and then I was awake the whole day, feeling quite refreshed after a while. cannabis was smoked repeatedly throughout the whole evening/night. the MDMA didn't really affect the acid + 4-aco-mipt combo, because it had worn off already.
/n
/n
in conclusion I must say that the lsd + 4-aco-mipt combo is the best combo I have ever done, it's something new, something special, something of both + something extra. the entire evening/night seemed to be perfect, everything fell into place perfectly, this was the best party i've ever been to and one of the best psychedelic experiences i've ever had.</bodytext></report>
