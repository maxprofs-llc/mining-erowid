I don't write trip reports often but seeing as there is a lack of information on recreational use of this substance I will try to contribute my two cents to the collective. I have about six years of experience in being a psychonaut in which I have done weed, lsd, mushrooms, dxm, ketamine, lsa, lsd, DOC, 4-ho-det, 5-meo-dmt, hydro/oxycodone, morphine, methadone, benzos, mdma, and others I am currently unable to recall. I am taking nootropics currently, piracetam and oxiracetam which not only have synergistic effects upon each other but also upon phenibut. I mix them for an improved experience, also.

The dose range seems to vary widely for different individuals, I recommend one begin with a dose ranging from 600-800 mg just to get their feet wet. Also building up a bit will help eliminate any hangover effects seen in the higher dose ranges for phenibut. Some day insufflating about 50 mg is similar to eating up to 10x that amount but I personally do not feel nearly the same, I would recommend against it. It is also worth mentioning phenibut has a nasty burn and taste. Enough background information, and on to the report.

+0:00 -- Ingested approx 3/4  tsp. [1.6-1.8g ] phenibut dissolved in a Dr. Pepper on a pretty empty stomach. It has a slightly sour and bitter taste, not pleasant but I've had worse. Going to dose this amount once more as I've heard it is much better than just taking a larger dose.

+0:45 -- Experiencing placebo and just a hint of euphoria. I sit back and watch the drug work its magic as Armin Van Buuren graces my eardrums with his melodic goodness. I have a slight tolerance mind you, nothing too strong, after taking 1 tsp the previous day and 1/2 the two before that.

+1:00 -- I fixed myself a nice nasty cocktail of 1/2 tsp. piracetam and right in between 3/4 and 1 tsp phenibut. I will consume it over the next 10-15 minutes. Warning this is the reported hangover zone, if you are drinking it has been told that you can get pretty messed up pretty quick. Please always take care to moderate your usage.

+1:15 -- Feeling a few subtle rushes of excitement and picking at some dessert as to avoid the aftertaste of my now almost completed soda. I've heard energy drinks can affect the experience, I was drinking the Full Throttle brand last night after my peak, though it didn't noticeably change anything. Come to think of it I do recall the energy buzz to be a little more smooth than usual.

+1:25 -- A subtle yet pronounced inebriation is upon me, it's creeping slowly. At +3-4 hours peak intensity is expected also to be accompanied with a good time ,). Beginning to fall into the music a bit (Way Out West - Intensify 02). I'm enjoying this and would say phenibut is a pleasant and worthy legal high. I will probably become a regular user not only for its feelings of well being but also for its anxiolytic properties.

+1:50 -- Feeling about the same subtle euphoria. Feels nice to lay or stand in a breeze, appetite is appreciated. It's odd, one must not quite concentrate on the effects for them to be the most noticeable. Relaxing into it feels wonderful, will be pleasant to undergo the peak.

+2:10 -- Slight modification of vision and balance.

+2:40 -- Not much change, I've kind of become used to it so it almost seems absent but there's still some feeling there.

+3:50 -- Peak seems not much different than before though there is almost an emotional aspect to it now.  Will attempt to boost by insufflating a few lines. Lost track of time for a while. The high actually is less hollow now. Feeling pretty damn good actually, nothing extravagant. Had the munchies so I fixed myself a large meal and indulged.

+5:00 -- Exhausted, feel like I'll have a great rest.

After nearly two weaks of no phenibut I had taken 3/4 tsp of phenibut and had a euphoric and joyful trip which I am still stuck in the middle of. I had mixed in kava and kratom tea which all seemed to go well. I'd rate phenibut as an overall worthy drug with benefits that I find rewarding when used properly.</bodytext></report>
