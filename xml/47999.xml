10:20pm - The Litmus Test! Consumed 10mg 2C-C in a gelcap, plus sublingualed the leftover table scraps. App initial dosage is 12-14mg. The last time I consumed app 20mg of this chlorinated phenethylamine I experienced some alergic type reactions, hence the lower dosage this time. The batch that the 20mg came from was of unknown quality, so the allergic reactions could have been due to an impurity in the compound. Now, over two years later, this compound has found its way back into my life and this time it has been tested using GC/MS and is indeeded pure. The possible chemical cross-tolerance or possible agonist regimen for the day consisted of a 50mg 5-HTP / 50mg Valerian capsule a few hours earlier, some water, and a Dickens Energy Drink composed of 38 mg Niacin, 9.6mg B6, 9.6ug B12, 1900mg Taurine, 1140mg Glucuronolactone, 150mg Caffeine, 90mg Inositol, and 9.6mg Horny Goat Weed Extract. I've also been smoking quite a bit of nugget (blueberries). Oh, and molly (mdma) the night before.

10:28pm - Already feeling some 1st alerts from the sublingual table scraps. Break beats courtesy Natural Nate are spinnin on the CD player.

10:32pm - Licked maybe another 2-4mg that was chillin on a razor and baggie on the table. Nasty ass taste, suck on some hard candy to rid my tongue of the chemie foulness.
/n
/n
10:52pm - Lick what's left of the inside of the bag, maybe another 2-4mg at max. Ok, so I guess this 'test' is gonna turn into a full dose.
/n
/n
10:56pm - Getting some nice waves of 'something.' I notice when I go into my room &amp; put the headphones on without any music playing (noise cancelling), I seem to be a little more fucked up than when there is outside sound in my space. I think the ambient noise, the TV, and the lights are minimizing my intoxication. Sensory deprivation could be the key to getting the most out of this mild yet effective compound.
/n
/n
11:00pm - I decide to put on a hoodie, and notice some nice chills as the fabric moves over my skin. Mmmm, tactile subdermal headiness!
/n
/n
11:09pm - Some slight visual waviness coming on now. My back itches a little, reminiscent of the allergic reaction symptoms I experienced back in 2002 or 2003 with 2C-C, except there are no hives this time, just a mild opiate-like itch. I think an abscence of light makes for a more predominant state of being at this point in the game.

11:11pm - Make A Wish! ;P
/n
/n
11:15pm - Approaching the 1 hour mark. Decide I need a 5mg booster.
/n
/n
11:18pm - Perhaps the booster was unnecessary, as I'm at a signficantly more intoxicated state than 3 mins ago. Nice and mellow intoxication. Feels good to breath.
/n
/n
11:21pm - Moving from unlit rooms to well-lit rooms produces some amazing after effect visuals, like dark trails of blackness that temporarily consume my whole vision. As I lay on the floor and stare at the ceiling, all I can think is, 'Oh no, chlorine! What have you done to my 2C-B?!?!'
/n
/n
11:26pm - Pretty damn sedated. My face, forehead, &amp; back itch a little. It feels great to just lay down and breath. It's not euphoric like some compounds, just mellow. Copious amounts of MDMA and alcohol last night reeked havoc on my digestive tract. My stomach is still all 'blah.' I think about smokin some nugget but decide in favor of an untainted experience for now.
/n
/n
11:31pm - Definite hallucinations now. Mild but defined and intense enough that I wouldn't trust driving, or even riding a bike. The sedation in combination with visual hallucinations makes operating any mobile machinery out of the question.
/n
/n
11:37pm - I just went to the bathroom. WOW! Light shadows &amp; reflections produce some amazing visuals! The secret is in the shadows. Pay attention to the shadows. I feel more sedated, but I'm definetely awake &amp; alert, just not stimulated. I couldn't dance or anything, nor do I want to. My best bet is to just lay back and breath.
/n
/n
11:44pm - The TV looks completely normal to me, so the true test is the window blinds! The windows are closed tight, there is no breeze, but the blinds are breathing and swaying like mad! The rest of the room appears abnormally normal, but the blinds are over there trippin all by themselves. Hmmm...
/n
/n
11:53pm - Vapor trails abound at this point. The visuals are not crisp and sparkling but soft and fluffy and wavey, like looking through a gaseous cloud. I feel safe and secure and comfortable in my little fort here, having no desire for outside intrusion from the non-spun world. I know it exists out there, but I'm perfectly content staying in here where it's warm and comfortable and trippy. I have no desire to experience loud noises or fast movements, this calm is all I want right now.
/n
/n
12:05am - Where's my voice??? Shhh! Communication desired only through thought &amp; written word. Don't speak. God damn it people, stop trying to call me! I will only respond in text, no vocalization.
/n
/n
12:13am - Feeling plateaued now. OEVs are nice ... I'm not ready for nuggs or alcohol, but I do want a little something. The remainder of the initial dose is left in a gelcap. 5mg just staring at me. Hmmm...
/n
/n
12:16am - I split this remainder in half, dumping app 2.5mg straight on my tongue. Dunno why I didn't just eat the gelcap, I know I'm going to end up eating the rest of it before the comedown. Ahhh, that's why! I realise I don't need another 5mg right now as I stare at the ever-growing carpet. Or do I???
/n
/n
12:26am - Despite having recently tongued 2.5mg and eaten the other 2.5mg gelcap, I feel, at this exact moment, a sharp decline in my condition. My voice is still just a whisper. (cough) I think I (cough) inhaled a little bit of (cough) powder into my lungs ... Grandma Wheezy in da house ... If I lay back and just relax, the world calmly melts away.
/n
/n
12:53am - Having reached the summit, I now slowly approach base camp. I guess it's time to let the outside world in. The party slowly trickles into my apartment ... alcohol is consumed, blueberries are smoked ... I try to hold onto a fastly fleeting experience by drinking another energy drink loaded with neurotransmitters. It helps a little but doesn't have that little turbo boost like post-ecstasy. Time to let go and return to the material world of noise, pollution, and socially acceptable destructive intoxicants. Ahhh, good old beer and cigarettes ... what the fuck am I doing with this shwag???
/n
/n
01:00am - Having fully surrendered now to the ebb and flow of society, I must say these past two hours have been quite an enjoyable excursion! A solitary, relaxing sedation with a quick yet prominent visual flare. All in all a good evening. This doesn't have the drawn-out taxing of mind, body, or soul that can come with 2C-T-7, 2C-T-2, or 2C-I. Simply a nice little dip into the waters of psychedelia for when I don't have the time to go for an all-out swim.
