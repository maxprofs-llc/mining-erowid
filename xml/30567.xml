I was put on Wellbutrin 150mg XL late in 2003 after unsuccessful attempts to curb my lack of focus on school, health, and well being. I have had a history of 'depression' leading up to my removal in school and placement into Rocky Mountain Academy where I later graduated in August of 2002. Since the low dosage I was put on seemed to have no affects till about 4-6 weeks later (which is normal), I started focusing more, maintaining good grades, and cut back on eating out with my friends.

This entire time it has been recommended not to smoke pot at all as it may not help the wellbutrin do its job. That was the first recommendation I blew off. I was binging on the weekends as I was getting better highs, although I can't relate this directly with Wellbutrin. Every night as I would go out, or in the mornings I would pop at least 5 pills of either extended or immediate release and head to school with no altered affects. Since looking for a cheap high was getting a lot more attention because of my lack of funds, I planned a weekend at a house unoccupied for a week. It wasn't going to be a big party, just another laid back weekend. A few people brought some bud and I brought some whiskey. I had popped a few pills earlier in the day and thought it might be fun to drink some to see what happens.

After about an accumulation of 4 drinks I sat down for a while. I gathered my thoughts that were eluding to anxiety, fear, pain, and nausea. At first I figured it was the bud, for the three of us we smoked about 2.5-3 grams throughout the morning and afternoon. I knew it wasn't the bud a few minutes later. I got overwhelming feelings of involuntary functioning. Its hard to explain but it felt like every nerve ending in my body, external and internal were being destroyed somehow. It wasn't a sensation of light needles, because my brain acted along with my body as well. I heard hundreds of popping noises in my head, it felt like the inner lobe was boiling over.

My heart rate severely increased and I lost touch with how bad my condition was. I barely reached to notice I was having light seizures in a few muscle groups. My mouth would tense and open up and twitch, along with a few extremities. I suddenly got up and felt helpless at that point. My friends noticed and one particular friend had a similar experience with wellbutrin, said to just ride out the storm, I got pissed and realized I had taked about 450 mgs of time-released as well as the 150's SR. Somewhere around 4 I headed up to the upstairs bathroom. I had seen friends get sick before and never wanted to be seen that way, but for fucks sake I swallowed my pride and puked my brains out.

I did that for about 1 and a half hours before I caught myself drifting off into a very euphoric state. My friend came up to check on me, I said I was sick but feeling better. Around 6 I got something to eat and tried to maintain. I would continue to be sick until the time-release wore off. When I could finally manage I got up to look at my face, as it felt weird, I was as white at a ghost with flaming chapped red lips. The rest of the night was incredible. I had thoughts and feelings that I had been re-born and awakened from something.

It was hard to get rest but I eventually did have a very very light sleep, waking up to go back to high school. Some typical symptoms of a hangover were present but I have felt different since it happened only a day or so ago. Like everything in my world flipped. I was talkative, but I'm more shy now, I have a lot less anxiety about school-family, as before I stressed about everything, and I approach every situation differently, almost from a third person. In the past I have been very irresponsible, but read the labels. They are there for a good reason. Some pharmaceutical lobbyist isn't trying to spoil all your fun by sticking the (do not drink alcoholic beverages) label on your prescription.</bodytext></report>
