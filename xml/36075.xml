I was in my room with very little to do and my doctor had prescribed me some amitriptyline for my migraines. But on that day I didn't have the usual headache so I was free to do just about anything I wanted. So for the heck of it I decide to try out this drug since the warning label sounded interesting 'Causes drowsiness, do not drink alcohol do not operate heavy machinery'. So I pop eight times my usual dose of 10 mg. I watch some TV waiting for something to happen and nothing does for a few hours or minutes, after that trip I'm not too sure about the time scale before it. As I'm sitting there I start getting these weird movements and sensations in my legs, then I start feeling numb all over. So i decide to head for my bed, thats the only good idea I had for the whole day.

From there on everything is bits and pieces and I don't know how long it lasted but it was too long. I felt like I was stuck in the same second, no movement no nothing. At one point I was pretty sure I had died. The clearest memory I have is trying to move my leg for a while. At first it didn't move but then it ended up in my face. I did not feel any pain just the kind of sensation you get when you have been sitting on your legs for a few minutes. I also remember not being able to breathe once or twice and a nagging feeling of being meant to do something but not being able to remember what it was.  Eventually I come out of it feeling like utter shit for a day.</bodytext></report>
