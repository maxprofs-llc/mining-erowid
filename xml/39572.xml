It was a eulogistic experience, while feeling emotional charge and strike. this was my first experience with (AET) but I was not too nervous about talking it. I remember getting out of school and taking the train in Manhattan. I was going to meet w/ this friend of mine who had got Xanax and Zoloft for me. When I got to the city I gave him a call and went to his apartment. He showed me the things he had gotten and he asked me if I wanted to take some AET. I had no idea what it was, &amp; I was originally planning on taking some acid or smoking hash. Sadly neither acid nor hash was around and I was in no mood to walk all the way over to the Park just for some acid. So I decided to stick with the idea about taking AET, and I was very spirited when I found out how similar the drug is to MDMA.

I took the AET around 5:30pm, it took about half an hour to start in. around 6:00pm I was totally fucking wired. I was sitting on the couch and could not feel my legs. The room got very dim and I felt a peaceful yet aggressive vibe. It was like a trance. It was like having dreams while wide awake. AET is basically a hypnotic induced drug, &amp; I was very easily sedated while on it. There was very mild euphoria which surprised me, &amp; the effects of Ecstasy were just way more vibrant in some aspects. with AET their is no bright light effect, colors dont get vivid they only appear with much more range. I smoked some haze that I found lying around to intensify the AET. when I stopped smoking I could feel the rush in my arms. I was not expecting the pot to kick into the AET that fast.

Unlike E their were no comedown effects. I felt very pleased, I had no disappointments about anything from the AET, it was a generally all around good experience.</bodytext></report>
