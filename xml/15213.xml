I first heard of Datura from my brother and one of his friends.  They'd collected an entire garbage bag of the stuff and had also made a video tape of themselves on Datura.  They gave me a few of the seed pods and told me what to do with it, and what to expect.

I expected nothing like what I experienced.  I boiled the seeds from one pod in some water, filled up a water bottle with the nasty tasting liquid and was on my way to meet up with some friends.  I was the only one willing to try this.

About half an hour after the drink was gone, I felt this intense buzz come on.  I remember walking down to a subdivision a few friends lived in.  My ex boyfriend being one of them.  Seeing the state I was in, they decided to keep me outside for a while.  Standing in my ex's back yard I remember being in a circle with friends I hadn't seen since grade school and sharing cigarettes, one right after the other.  We were talking and laughing and having a great old time.  When I bent down to pick up a cigarette I'd dropped, I saw about 15 burned out smokes lying on the ground.  Obviously no one had smoked them.  They'd just burned themselves down to the filter.  I looked up and there were no long time friends of mine.

Just the group of three I'd arrived with.  I later found out that they watched the whole time as I dropped one cigarette after another onto the ground, talking to absolutely no one, but found it too amusing to stop me.  I would have probably done the same thing.  When it was time to move on to inside the house, I suddenly felt too heavy to stand up and walk.  I crawled on my hands and knees across the yard and into the house.  They found this incredibly funny too, so they let me crawl.

Once inside it was a whole different story.  I felt warm so I stripped down to my bra and undies, thinking it was completely normal and everyone else was this way too.  Thankfully his parents were gone for the night.  His sister, however wasn't.  I'd managed to escape the 'sitters' who I felt were bringing down my high by telling me to put clothes on, and get upstairs into his sisters room.  From what they tell me, I kicked her out of her bed and layed down and went to sleep.  Not for long though.  I had the most incredible dreams I'd ever had, and kept waking up, suddenly rocketing out of the bed.

My ex brought me downstairs where I saw that my three friends had left me there alone with him.  Still in my bra and undies.  He took me down to his room in the basement where I managed to walk into a table and take a good chunk out of my knee.  I felt nothing.  While he was getting a bandage, I made my way into the bathroom and hopped into the shower.  Still in my underclothes. He found me, put some of his clothes on me and put me to bed.  As he soon found out, keeping me there was a problem.  The second he thought I was out, he'd let go of me and I would bolt out of the bed like a bat out of hell.  He found it was easier to lay in the bed beside me and literally hold me down.  He kept telling me that everything was under control and nothing bad was going to happen to me.  Although, at the time that really wasn't a concern of mine.  I kept hearing my cell phone ring and would desperately try to get to it.  My ex kept reminding me I didn't have a cell phone.

Eventually I got to sleep.  When I woke up, the only side effect I felt was a slight loss of vision.  I could still see, but saw better with my reading glasses on.

My brother had told me that some people get sick and end up throwing up all night.  This did not happen to me.  I had a very good time and wouldn't think twice about doing it again.

The best advice I can offer is to make sure someone who is sober is with you.  Designate them the 'sitter' and things should run smoothly.</bodytext></report>
