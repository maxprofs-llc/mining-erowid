Everyday for the past two months (stopping of course during the occasional AMT trip) i have taken 350mg of 5-htp at night with suprisingly good results. From the first night immediate results were felt in the form of a deep sleep followed by a marked relief from my moderate/severe depression. Since then, however, the degree to which the depression has diminished is perhaps less evident, yet the somatic effects are still quite potent. I think 5-htp may have less use for me as an anti-depressant than as a sleep aid. Nonetheless, it's worth my ten dollars.</bodytext></report>
