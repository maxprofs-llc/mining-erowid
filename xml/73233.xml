I took 3 pills of trazodone at about 6 or 7 in the evening.  I put on a movie, hoping that I would just be able to chill out and enjoy it.  Unfortunately, I found myself becoming inredibly tired.  I became less and less able to focus on the movie.  It just seemed to me like a smear of color and sound.  My head began to hurt, and it felt as though it were stuffed with cotton.  This became increasingly worse and worse over the course of about half an hour.  Finally I realized that I was about to pass out in my chair. It was all I could to get up and turn the movie off, then crawl into bed.  I fell immediately asleep, and awoke the next morning with one of the WORST headaches of my life.  I also felt groggy and just generally poor.  This lasted for most of the day.  At first I thought the headache might just be from dehydration, so I drank lots of water throughout the day, but it did not seem to help very much, so I have to conclude that it was probably the fault of the trazodone.

My experience was pretty disappointing and unpleasant.  I might try it again, but I would probably try insufflation and a higher dosage, and I would also want to make sure I was not tired at all and had gotten a good night sleep the night before.</bodytext></report>
