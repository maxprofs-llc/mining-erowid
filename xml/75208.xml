one day i read up on different salvias and so i look through my garden and sure enough theres some right there. i pick 5 leaves and dry them out. i take one large hit and hold it in for 30 seconds. i did this four times. finally when i was done i felt a buzz. my entire body was buzzing. it felt like electricity, it was pretty nice.
/n
 the effects wore off after about 2 hours but tottally worth it!</bodytext></report>
