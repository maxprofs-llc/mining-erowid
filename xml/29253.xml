My parents were out of town for the day so my friend and I each ate 1/8 of psilocybe cubensis.  I ate very light food the day before so my stomach was mostly empty and we started eating them at 9:30 in the morning.  We just chewed up small pieces at a time and washed them down with some juice.  By 9:40 we had finished eating them.

I went downstairs to get my queen sized Aerobed.  I inflated it in my room but not completely so it still rippled like a waterbed.  Then I laid down and in only a few minutes I noticed some of my posters were starting to get larger and smaller very subtly and I wasnt sure if I imagined it or not.  This was probably only 15 minutes after ingestion.  A few minutes later the dots on one of my posters started to move around and things were definitely breathing.  I felt a little bit anxious but also happy and calm and very comfortable.

For a while we both just laid in my room watching the visuals come on.  I noticed that a wood grain desk I have was rippling and the grains of wood were folding in on themselves.  Then I got up to put on some music on my computer and my desktop wallpaper formed many different sections all of which were moving through and around each other like some sort of complex machine.  I put on Boards of Canada and lay back down.  At this point everything I looked at had its own very unique and changing visuals.  The clouds in the background of my Two Towers poster were flying by and spreading onto the walls and the orc soldiers were jumping up and down preparing for battle and Bruce Lee was getting very old and very young repetitively and drops of sweat and bruises would appear on his skin.  When I closed my eyes I saw very intricate mythical creatures formed out of rainbow colored lines.  They were singing the music that I was listening to and would breath fractal fire and ice and water.

At this point my friend brought my black lab upstairs and we played with her for a long time.  We both were sure that she was in fact some sort of ancient animal god who knew far more than we could ever imagine and we found it ironic that she relied on us for food and care despite her great wisdom, which she was now revealing to us.  She would change sizes and glow but her fur was the one thing that did not change textures and we called her the only constant and she became some sort of spiritual guide.  She was made entirely out of fur and no bones so when I pet her my hands would sink into her fur and absorb her warmth.

Next we went downstairs into the kitchen to get drinks.  The vine pattern on the wallpaper that I always thought was kind of tacky begun to grow and spread throughout the whole kitchen.  The vines would encircle the window frames and become 3D.   The wood floors and wood furniture became extremely intricate flowing Arabic patterns.  At this point I had to pee so I went to the bathroom.  The toilet was some sort of white creature swallowing my pee and grumbling about his horrible job.  When I looked in the mirror I appeared normal until I would think of a different emotion at which point my image would change drastically.  I thought of age and my skin began to sag and wrinkle and when I thought of sadness my eyes grew droopy and my mouth formed a frown.  I had a sense of control over all of this and found it extremely amusing.

Next I sat down in the living room and looked at a book of state maps.  None of the states were familiar and the lines were constantly changing so that I thought they were some kind of medieval treasure maps.  Then we decided to go outside on my back porch to get some fresh air.

On the porch we made some very deep philosophical realizations about humans confining themselves from nature but that nature confines us from space and even in space we would be one step away from our spiritual selves, which was what actually lies at the end of the universe.  The clouds formed a huge river with the white swirling into the blue and flowing by at great speeds.  The grass started to grow up the side of my house and fence and my vision could zoom in and see millions of insect communities interacting with each other.  Then when I looked down at the deck I had the most beautiful visual I have had.

It was as if time was moving extremely fast and the wood was decaying and regenerating over and over again.  I thought of it like the sands of time blowing over everything, an endless cycle of regeneration.  The wood would appear bright and new and then gradually change to gray and antique looking.  I could see the individual particles separating from each other and swirling together and reconnecting.  We moved to my front yard and I saw the trees constantly growing more complex, sprouting smaller and smaller branches to form a fractal pattern.  These branches would sway and twist and vibrate depending on what sort of energy was affecting them at the moment.  When we went back inside and sat on my couch we discussed how we had become enlightened with the wisdom of nature and that that was what my dog knew that made her so intelligent.  I felt an urge to let her outside so she could run in the grass but I knew that because of human progress it was unsafe to let her wonder free outside because of the roads and cars that we had built.

We listened to Massive Attack, Morrissey and The Orb and everything would change according to the music.  During fast trance sequences things would move in frames that changed to the tempo of the music and during slower or more ambient sequences everything would breath and swirl and change colors depending on the tone and pitch.

I went back upstairs to use the bathroom again and the toilet was still grumpy about me peeing into his mouth.  The walls became changing mathematical equations that I could not see but knew existed because of the order of the patterns that formed out of the paint.  Then I went and sat in the hallway and looked out the window and all of a sudden the trip stopped.  Things still moved and swirled slightly but this gradually faded away and I just sat and contemplated what I had seen and learned.

All of a sudden I had an overpowering urge to eat meat so we both cooked ham and pepperoni and cheese sandwiches and then sat down to watch TV.  During the trip we were strongly opposed to the idea of TV so we had closed the cabinet the TV was in but now I felt mentally drained as if I had just taken the SAT so we needed some sort of thoughtless entertainment.  The trip lasted from about 10:00 am  2:00 pm.</bodytext></report>
