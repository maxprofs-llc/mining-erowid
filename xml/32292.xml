I recieved 500 mgs of 5-meo-amt. This chemical is very tiny and the dose is extremely small. What I did was take a visine bottle and count out how many drops came out. I wasn't crazy about putting the stuff in a large amount of alchohal because I can't fathom drinking milliliters of grain alchohal. 375 drops came out of the visine which was perfect. I then rinsed the bottle out and put a little less than 500 mgs in (some was stuck in the bottle).

Then I added the 153 proof liquor to the mark where the drops ended. The 5-meo-amt is very soluable in alchohal. It dissolved almost instantly. I shook it anyway, and let it sit for a few hours. The chem was still dissolved. I shook it, and dropped 2 drops on my toungue. The chem was tasteless and absorbed right on my tongue. I think the alchohal might have numbed the taste and made for easy absorbtion.

Within 20 min I felt something, but I couldn't pin point it. I had no nasuea during the trip, which was mild and only about 7 hrs long. I had mild trails, color enhancement, and minor patterning. I ate 4-aco-det the night before so I probally exhausted my tolerance. I will wait a week and try 5 drops. I am currently storing the solution in my freezer, and it hasn't froze. I am still nervous about freezing it, but I figure it should preserve it for a long time considering 500 mgs of 5-meo-amt is not something you can use up in a week.</bodytext></report>
