I am a freshman in college. I have experienced the effects of many different drugs. MDMA has always been my favorite, along with LSD, which I have only used once.

This experience was my third LSA trip in two months. I first experienced LSA earlier that year from Morning Glory seeds, but never got the full trip. The first trip on LSA from HBWR seeds was very powerful and allowed me to explore certain parts of my consciousness effortlessly. I spent the evening chatting away with an old friend, allowing us to grow a lot closer in the process. After this, a hilarity and lightness of body was experienced and I was unable to fall asleep until about 7 hours after I took the seeds.

For the trip in question, I cleared off the fuzzy cover of five seeds. Then, I soaked them in warm water for about 2 hours. After washing the seeds some more, I chewed them and drank them down with some water. It was a Friday afternoon. I was feeling very good, and very excited that I would trip during the day and get to see nature in daylight. My mind was fairly clear.

T0:30 About half an hour after dosing, while watching the movie Pi (one of my favorites), I went over to see my friend Jer, in the room down the hall. He was excited about my trip and said that it would be better if I smoked some cannabis. I was already beginning to feel a little light and funny, and I said ok. He gave me a small bud, and not having smoked weed in about 50 weeks, I ripped off a fourth of it and said, this is enough.

T1:30 Following this, I loaded the top quarter of a cigarette with the cannabis-tobacco mix, and finished watching Pi, as I came up higher and higher. I went outside to have my weed-a-rette and once I took those warm tokes, only one full pull of actual cannabis, I already began to feel good. I sat there on a bench in the smoking area in my dorm and then I saw my floor mates near me smoking weed. Once I finished my cigarette, an RA and a dorm official came outside to smoke. I decided I would stay a little bit to draw their attention from my neighbors. I sat there, smoked another cig, and talked to the RA and the dorm lady. They were talking about some pointless boring things and in the middle of the conversation, I began to feel warm inside and began to see them in extreme detail. In another minute, I began to feel overwhelmed by this sensory clarity and began to see little ripples in front of me, electric rips in space time. I left their company and headed inside.

During the 20 second walk from the door to the elevator, I was experiencing full blown hallucinations. I could barely see past them, the rips in space time. It was as through the world was now filled with holes. I waited a second for the elevator to come, and when I stepped in, with about five other people, I could not even see their faces. I was immersed in the hallucinations. At this point I was thinking only, Why did I do this? I thought that I messed up, that now I would feel the overwhelming state for hours and probably get sick. I got to my room, took off my jacket and sat down. And suddenly, the hallucinations subsided and I was feeling better, and stronger, and my trip suddenly became great and amazing. I felt both the lightness and sedation of the LSA, as well as the body buzz of the cannabis. My thoughts were very clear and focused. I sat and listened to music for about an hour and did some writing.

T 2:30 I decided to lie down and relax and think. I ended up experiencing a strong visionary state during which I was able to deal with parts of myself I did not want to affect my thoughts and actions. I encountered a part of me which was always scared, paranoid and just in general weak. This part of me began to overwhelm me and make me feel afraid, until I had a thought I never really had before, Why be upset and weak?. The thought blew my mind and I arose from my state and just walked around the dorm feeling incredibly happy.

T 4:00 The cannabis buzz was gone, but the seeds were still working their magic. I felt pretty euphoric and my mind was still clear. I went to the dining hall to get some food, and walked around outside for a while, chain smoking cigarettes, which tasted very good. Everything outside looked so gorgeous, and I kept looking up at the sky and feeling overwhelmed. I saw this guy who lives on my floor, someone I have been a bit infatuated with for a while, and I realized why I like him, because he reminds me of a guy who had abused me when I was younger. I realized that liking people who remind me of this guy sets me back, and I am usually attracted to guys like that. I always thought that the guy abused me out of some twisted version of love, but I saw that I am just rationalizing something traumatic to create the illusion that the events of 6th grade didnt fuck me up. I felt so relieved.

T 6:00 With my renewed appreciation for life and myself I went out with a new friend of mine and we talked about relationships and drugs for hours. I felt very open and very happy.

T 9:00 I felt down, but still elated and energized for hours. Truly my most intense psychedelic experience, with absolutely no ill effects. I am very thankful for this experience because I feel a lot more mature and stronger now, able to deal with the pains of living and the fears around me. The trip was half a year ago and I still tell myself, Stop it! when I become anxious. Of course the trip could not perfectly solve all of my problems, but it gave me a new perspective on them. I am surprised however that the early synergy of the cannabis and LSA led to a few minutes of full blown hallucinations.</bodytext></report>
