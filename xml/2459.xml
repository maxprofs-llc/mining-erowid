I just wanted to warn everyone about this particular herb.  I visited an herb store last night, and recognized the name 'Calamus' on the shelf from the Legal Highs text.  So, being the rash and inept fool that I am, I bought it, took it home and imbibed it as per the 20th Century Alchemist's directions.  Bad move.

I drank this *horribly* bitter brew at around 10 o'clock, and experienced little (if any) of the anticipated effects.  However, to my chagrin, at around 3, I felt ill.  And I barfed, barfed, barfed, and for a change of pace, I vomited.  I had my girlfriend call the Poison Control Center to make sure that I wasn't going to die.  We found that Calamus' effects, instead of euphoric, are a stomach irritant.  So, I spent most of the night cradled around the Porcelain God.

/n  always check out what you buy, and make SURE that it's gonna do what it is supposed to.

/n  if you're gonna poke around the psychotropic section of the Herb store, and try stuff, call Poison Control first to see if you should expect bad results.

/n  there are other, much mellower substances to partake of than Calamus. (not to mention tastier)</bodytext></report>
