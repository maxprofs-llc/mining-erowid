I had a wake and bake day and was tired but still too stoned to sleep. A few days before I had bought, a bottle of Fingerprinted, Kava Kava root powder capsules. I have ingested Kava several times over a period of a year. So I was in my room with only the black light on with a Stranglers CD playing, stoned. I poured six 500 mg.  tablets into my hand a swallowed them down with Nikken pimag water (magnetic filtered water). I chilled in my room for about an hour listening to music.

After about 30 minutes I decided to smoke a bowl out of my small tin foil pipe. So I smoked the bowl and layed back and shut my eyes in a sleepy/dreamy state. I noticed my heart was beating fast but that always happens when I get stoned. I lay there for probably an hour completely stoned and seeing magnificent closed eye hallucinations. Like colorful,  psychedelic, gasoline swirl, patterns. The beautiful hallucinations were so strong that when I opened my eyes and looked into the darkness I could see them perfectly. It was like when I took some acid that was almost completely visuals, and I could control them! Keep in mind that I have a very low tolerance for marijuana. I find marijuana and Kava Kava (especially if I take alot) are a good psychadelic mixture. I can see why Kava Kava has been labeled as a hallucinogen by some people!</bodytext></report>
