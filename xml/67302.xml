Did my research and took the average amount for recreational use and ended up having roughly 20 mild seizures and one full blow seizure where my heart nearly stopped and had to be defibulized or however you spell it. Although I did feel VERY good for 4 hours before any of the seizures started, but it definently wasn't worth it.

Note, I have aortic stenosis and tricuspid prolapse. Doctors said that could have been the reason it happened so make sure you do some research before taking this medicine.</bodytext></report>
