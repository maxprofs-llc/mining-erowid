I tried salvia at home, it was my own homegrown plant I took leafs from. I rolled 2 harstuffed joints in cigarrette paper an after I smoked the first on I felt floating and a bit cool. I laughed at a ricegrain for about a minute then I rolled another one, it was a bit hard to roll it because I was a bit light-headed.

After the second one I felt nothing more but the floating feeling and happiness. I just stood in the living room smiling and felt like I floated around. The feeling was very short, about 6-7 minutes and wasn't that great. I have to smoke a large amount to get a strong feeling and I also think that it is very strong taste and it tastes really bad. I wasn't to happy with it but hey, it's legal.</bodytext></report>
