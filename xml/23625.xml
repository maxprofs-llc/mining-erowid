A friend of mine said she could get some opium from a client.  Last night she brought said substance and showed it to me.  I've had real opium (harvested from poppies I grew) and this did sort of look like it, although it was reddish instead of dark brown.  I thought that odd.

We threw a chunk in the glass pipe and fired it up.  At that time I didn't know about 'red rock', which is actually just incense.  The taste is just slightly flowery, with a little pine thrown in!  We tried some more hits just for the hell of it.

No high, no opium, no nothing.  If anyone tries to sell you red colored crystalline 'opium' rocks don't bother.</bodytext></report>
