For the past day or two I have been reaserching Nutmeg becoming ever the more interested in its effects. Likewise I did my best trying to find someone to take it with but most people seemed to think it was too cheesy. Or that it would ot work. The following is a chronological chart of what happened during my first trip with nutmeg.

Date: July 2nd Wensday 2003 
/n
/n
7:00 : Woke up. I also ate a bagel with cream cheese and butter.
/n
/n
7:45 : Took 30mgXR of Adderall (ADHD Medication, time realease capsule, I take one of these every day at around 7:45)
/n
/n
11:25 : I have decided, that due to me being unable o find anyone to do nutmeg I will take it today, before going to a D+D thing with some friends. Sadly I do not have the means of weiging it properly so it will most likely turn out as an estimation I beleive my current Body Weight is 120-125 pounds. A small side note is that I am currently peaking on my adderall.

11:34 : Placed a Hard ginger candy in my mouth. I am sucking on it in hope the Ginger will counteract its effects fo nauesia
/n
/n
11:42 : I have done the best I can measurement wise, and am going to take about 16cc's of 'Spice Islands' 'Ground Nutmeg', its pretty old, I just hope its good effects are still there.
/n
/n
11:44 : Swallowed the ginger candy.
/n
/n
11:45 : Took the Nutmeg orally, at first I thought it would be incredably viscous, but it went down pretty smooth after a few gulps of trader joes cherry cider. Theres still a few grains of nutmeg left in the container I toook it in. not much though
/n
/n
11:48 : All I got to do now is gather my D+D stuff + wait for my ride, I feel almost casual about this.
/n
/n
11:51 : Decided to take another 1/5 of 30cc's of The Nutmeg, it went down poorly and I felt like vomiting midway. I have a disgusted feeling around my mouth Now its even hard for me to drink my cherry cider.
/n
/n
11:53 : Placed another Ginger candy in my mouth, it may just be a ruse but I no longer have a disgusted feeling in my mouth my throats a different matter though.
/n
/n
11:56 : My mouth feels a little more Numb then usual, but thats probably just the Ginger.
/n
/n
11:58 : Everything seems a little lighter and more colorful, I think my eyes are dilated. I just asked my dad for 5 dollars, he doesnt seem to notice.
/n
/n
12:06pm : I have that usually feeling over my eyes that I get when having an interesting Euphoria a kind of heavy and Damp Feeling.
/n
/n
12:09 : I noticed my breathing is like that when I'm high more tangable than normal, er flowing
/n
/n
12:31 : Played DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) for awhile, made it throug only one song, Xanadu, out of four, most of the problems were due to lag But I greatly enjoyed most of the music. I feel simillar to when I'm high, oh and I noticed some of my visual Reflexes to DDR were off.
/n
/n
12:38 : Played Healing vision, still Noticing a few Reflexes to the arrows impaired, but listening to the music is great, I am hearing it on awhole new levels, New beats and harmonics I have not really heard before. However I didn't feel the usual intensity that I feel when I play songs like that, it was kind of like a gentler mellow intensity.
/n
/n
12:55 : Picked up by D+D people a few minutes ago, They asked what this paper was, I don't think they realize I placed another Ginger in my mouth
/n
/n
1:05 : I Grab a mountain Dew and start sipping it slowly.
/n
/n
1:24 : Looking at one of my speckled dice is interesting.
/n
/n
2:03 The 'High' feelings seem to have faded away, I'm still drinking the one MD, I do enjoy the music in the Backround.
/n
/n
2:41 : I'm Noticing prolonged physical feeling that feels a little less surreal to what I feel when smoking a lot of weed.
/n
/n
4:06 : Finnaly finished.
/n
/n
7:25 : (right here my handwriting becomes really bad and doubles in size) I'm in a great deal of stomach pain sharp and clinching. I kind of Half wish to vomit But like, not normally. The pain seemed to happen in cojuction with me eating burritos.
/n
/n
This is where the paper ends. Thats the report I had written up yesterday. Around 6 o'clock we ate some burritos from taco bell and they noticed that I was really out of it a little afterwards. Around 7:30 I drank some advil and water. After I finished my mountain dew I did end up drinking another one before going home at around 10. I also ate another two Ginger candies, my frieds think thats what caused the stomach pain, before 7:25. The stomach pain lasted for about two-three hours and seemed to let up a little after I had the advil and water, but never completly. I did try going to the bathroom but that didn't help much. I did have a few minor hullicinations around 8:00, one of my friends was spinning a 10 sided dice, and when he grabbed it, it looked like it was still spinning. I also think that the mountain dew, or at least the caffein, seemed to cancel out the effects of the stoned feeling.

Overall it seemed a interesting experience that I plan to try in a day or two, after reading a few more reports, and getting a friend to try it with. What surprised me the most was that I was not very thirsty which I usually am alot.</bodytext></report>
