Ive Been Hooked on opiates for manny years now. Taking everything with opiates in it(Including heroin). Ive had manny problems feeding my mental and phisical addiction. I ust to drive to chicago every day from 2 hours away. A friend of mine Got on a pill after getting arrested called Buprenorphine(Suboxone) and his doctor perscribed him 1 and a half (4.00mg) pills a day.

He told me if I want to get off the 'junk' I could have a pill a day and after a fuew more weeks of binging i finnally took about 6 pills from him. I came down after 3 days and finnally Took one pill. I was supprised that this got me high and well again! Now I get one pill a day from my own doctor and am well and happy. Once in awile I still stop takin it and mess around, but this stuff really has changed my life-style!
