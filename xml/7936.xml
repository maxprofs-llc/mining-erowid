I've been smoking weed &amp; hash for the past 3-5 years &amp; i've tried almost everything but ACID. I made a deal with my bro 3 years ago that I'd only do it if he was around cuz he has done acid alot, just in case I freak out. I was visiting my bro (E) in US &amp; on 4th Jan 2001. (E) got some Acid we took the first hit around 10:30 pm, E went to spin &amp; I just sat &amp; waited for something to happen after all I've been researching on Acid for almost a year.

12 am, nothing I only had a headache cuz I haven't slept well. So me bro called his friend (K) &amp; he came around 12:45 with some more Acid, GHB &amp; Ketamine /n

1 am we took 2 hits each.

2 am, still nothing &amp; I was getting so bored &amp; sleepy the only thing I felt different were colors they were more alive. (K) walked up to me &amp; asked if I wanted more, I Said yes &amp; this time I took 4 hits (crazy I know) but I was starting to feel that this shit doesnt work with me. I was wrong.

3:30 am I started Trippin funny, I was on the sofa &amp; I was a bit cold so I covered myself with a red blanket, 15 mins after that I was laughing &amp; yelling &amp; jumpin my ass on the sofa &amp; when the guys asked me whats Wrong with me I Simply said : there's a fuckin Star Trek episode down here of course I was the hero.

The guys didn't wana leave me long on the couch &amp; they convinced me that I have'nt seen anything yet, So K pulls me &amp; takes me close to the black light in the corner &amp; shows me his Tattoo. Wooooooooooow I couldnt open my mouth I was all eyes looking at the best 3-d tattoo i've ever seen. After a bit of GHB, dancing &amp; beer I was starting to feel funny so I went to WC to wash my face, I locked myself in looked at the mirror &amp; I was shocked, It was'nt me I kept looking at myself 4 a while not knowing that my vision was fucked up not me. It started getting quiet &amp; I thought that the guys left (I was so focused on the mirror that I lost contact with everything but my vision &amp; my reflection on the mirror). I started talking to myself within me &amp; sometime there I just got hot so I decided to sit. 2 mins after that everything was going black, I felt like trapped in a coffin &amp; I choked. 4 a min there I thought I was dying &amp; I calmed down like I never did &amp; then I heard a voice saying hey wake up &amp; snap out of it, you're ok it's only what u took, concentrating on that voice, it was mine!! I donno how that happend then.

I'm sure I forgot a part, I was in there for 5 mins, felt like a year, anyway I dragged myself out &amp; I went out of the house, took the dog 4 a walk etc... When I came back everyone was looking for me they thought I jumped in the lake near by or something I dont remember well but the one thing I wont forget was that look on my bro's face. He asked if I was ok &amp; I smiled back &amp; said, yeah I'm chillin. I had 2 more tabs a while after that.. I've done Acid 13 other times &amp; I still will. You may be asking yourself WHY ?? Simply read below :

ACID is a never ending story, the key to a good trip is inside of me, it takes alot of courage &amp; faith &amp; dont ever let anyone talk you into anything if you're not ready. Personally I dont believe in ADDICTION i think it's all in our head I had second thoughts about myself when my trip went down but instead of passing out overdosed in the tub, I partied for 3 days nonstop.

P.s : I wrote this after having 2 hits &amp; I think i've been writing all that for the past 4 hours, I'm too tired to go over it again, anyway I'M SORRRRYYYY IF I SOUNDED STUPID take care all &amp; dont forget THE WORLD IS BETWEEN YOUR HANDS, WE MAKE OUR OWN FATE &amp; OUR OWN TRIP</bodytext></report>
