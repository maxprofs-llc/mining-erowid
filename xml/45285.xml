Ambien and Weed Combo 8/7/05
/n
/n
9:15 T Minus 0 minutes starting now
/n
/n
T:00  Ate First 10 mg of Ambien.  I plan on smoking a little nug in about half an hour or so and then eating 20 more mg of Ambien at around 11.  Stomach is slightly filled, ate maybe an hour or so ago.  No initial effects noticed.
/n
/n
T:09  First funny feelings noticed.  Nothing serious.  Not even touching a +.
/n
/n
T:13  I feel some slight anticipation of some sort, visual distortion to the most mild degree, and an over all feeling of off-ness.
/n
/n
T:17  Mild stoned feeling more pronounced.  No real visual distortions though my field of vision is slightly off.  Thought pattern is somewhat off, I keep on thinking in much more complex terms and shit seems to go on for longer.  Time distortion noticed, noticed to the slightest degree that is.  I would say this has successfully reached a +.  I'm slightly disappointed at the way in which I'm writing this.  It gets the message across but I loose out on writing possibilities, i.e. with this style I am forced to relay the facts.  Maybe when I toke the first little nug in about fifteen minutes I will be at a more preferred level of intensity.
/n
/n
T:22  I am going to go and blaze the first nug within the next ten minutes.
/n
/n
T:27  Smoked half of initial first bud.  I think I will smoke the next half in the next ten or so minutes.  Not super intense but very pronounced THC effects, drowsyness or stonyness feeling slightly heavier than usual, visual field is still somewhat standard.  No real distortion noticed.  Slight patterns in the air and ripplings in dark surfaces but nothing remotely surprising or out there.  Those effects wont be expected until later.  Off to finish rest of nug.
/n
/n
T:31  THC effects much more pronounced now, after completion of the third bowel.  Over all high has now reached ++, however I attribute most of it to the weed.  There is a definite vibe or undertone that I dont recognize, and I attribute that to the Ambien.  Perhaps it is starting to take a little more attention.  I think I am going to lie down for the next hour and decide weather or not to eat the rest of the Ambien at 10:30 or 11.  I think I will, but right now my high is reaching some intense heights and I want to go see if this Ambien has distorted my visual field to any significant degree.  My sentence seem to be growing longer and my memory is progressively getting fucked.
/n
/n
T:39  High is definitely pushing +++ but not quite there.  I am very stoned and mentally high at the same time, one of the unique qualities I give thanks to the Ambien for.  The Ambien is providing increased visual sensations that aren't quite out there but definitely apparent.  I am eager for it to be 11 so that I can consume the rest of the Ambien.  I think the Ambien effects are becoming more pronounced every second because I can feel a new feeling slipping over my brain like a soft glove emerging from the depths of somewhere every fucking second.  Thoughts and sentences seem to weeve themselves together until theyve woven a vast river of words.  My process is completely screwed.  Maintence is reaching the max.  I am stoned.  I am incredible high.  I would like to get with a girl, most preferred would be Sarah, then Lily I guess.  YO I AM so FUCKING HIGH.  I am gonna lay down and look at shit.  Maybe I'll draw.  I'll catch you back in a while.
/n
/n
T:55  I am extremely high in all possible ways.  My visual field isnt as distorted as I wished it would be but mentally and certainly physicly and almost auditorily I am completyly fucked.  I find it very difficutlt to type.  Every sentence is taking ages to complete (like the pyramids except those fuckers were built by slaves and these sentences are only made by the reachings of my mind and the pounding of my fingers on this key board) damn those sentences that are horribly put together and go on for ages.  I am sorry.  Like I said, I am extremely high.  It is only ten o8 and I am extremely fucked.  I humbled by the power of this combo.  I am especially humble at the thought of eating two more and toking another large nug.  Maybe I'll save some for tomorrow as an after crew pepper upper.  That sounds like a good thought.  Well I'm out for a while I have business to attend to.
/n
/n
T130  I just downed my second Ambien and readied some marijuana for consumption.  The Ambien has taken on much more of an active roll.  She if performing wondrous things with the computer screen making it seem as if the sentences are rippling or shifiting.  Yes there is lots of shifting.  I will smoke in about ten minutes I want this second Ambien to catch on a little.  I can already feel it starting to work on me.  Once I really notice the effects, I'll load up a bowl, and toke away.  I'm out for now.  Peace
/n
/n
T:10 55 it is 10 55   
/n
I believe the Ambien are starting to work hand in hand now.  Everything is intensly werid and phychedilic. I have to piss.  This is intense and crazy and I lovveee it.  too the max.  I'm gonna go piss and that should be interesting.  Then ill sit down and write a little about what ever I can think of, and then I'll prob go and enjoy a jolly toke and some smoke.  Then the real fun begins.  I am about to consume one MASSIVE truly massive hit my freind this one is a wallopppererr, and the ambien haven't finished coming on I am GONNA BE AT THE MOOON TONIGHT.

Ambien can always count on giving me a good surprise.  The next day I woke up with this vague memory of something incredible and amazing happening the night before, I just can't quite put my finger on it.  I woke up this morning and re read what I had written and I swear that I can't remember writing anything after T time is 11 35.
/n
/n
Last night's trip was indeed amazing.  While talking to a friend online I was convinced that there were other people apart of the conversation, and you can see in some of my notes how I mention we are and use pronouns for his and her.  The feeling that there are other people there is extremely real, and at times I thought I could see them, strewn out on my couch, lying on my floor, all motionless but emanating powerful vibes.

This wasn't as intense or physically extravagant as a DXM trip or nearly as visual as Shrooms.  One of my cannabis trips I experienced during the beginning of the summer I still consider more intense than this Ambien trip, but the point is that while on Ambien I am allowed to see the world differently.  Weed definitely made all the difference, propelling the already screwy Ambien consiousness into depths that I haven't reached before.  Everywhere I looked things were shifting and crawling with life.  When I would stare at my computer screen absolutely hellbent on dicifering what was written in the AIM box, I could of sworn that my desk was warping towards the computer and that the screen was growing the larger, all the while huge blobs of mass were warping all around my peripheral vision field.  It was an intense and horribly strange journey, one which I'll relive soon.</bodytext></report>
