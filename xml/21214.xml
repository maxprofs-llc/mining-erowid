I have been assaying the 'wild daggas' now for the last six months.  I personally believe it takes several experiences with any substance before one can truely validate the effects.

I have experimented with smoking both Leonurus sibiricus (marahuanilla) and Leonotis leonurus (Lions Tail). Of the latter I used mostly pure flower tops. I have had now close to twenty experiences  smoking one large cigarette of one or the other plant. I always do this in the same setting to keep the variables of the experience down to a minimum. This is my own personal system of 'control'.  The setting is a quiet house, without any chance of distraction.  A clean consciousness, free from any other external substances. Most important though is the clarity of the intent for using such a medicine.

On my experiences; The fist time I tried these plants (I group them together with also Mother Wort for they all contain the same active component leonurine) I thought I surely felt a mild cannabis-like effect that seemed to last for less than one hour.  Being aware of the 'placebo effect' I did not want to draw a conclusion from my first experience.  Although after several repeated experiments in the same setting using the same dosage I have confirmed/validated (at least for myself) the effects of these plants, and yes they are effective. I would put them in the catagory of a mild euphoric sedatives.  Very simular to a low grade marijuana (shade leaf) with shorter duration to the experience (up to 1 hour). Using my dose (1 fat J) I experienced very little negative after effects aside from a mild drowsy feeling that seemed to pass quickly.

I do feel that these plants have a potential for application.  Although they are simular to Marijuana they are by no means a substitute for 'killer green buds', but they might be nice to keep around for when times get dry.</bodytext></report>
