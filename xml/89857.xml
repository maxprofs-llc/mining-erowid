Well I'm prescribed Concerta and I have terrible sinus problems.

I did some research to make sure the drugs were okay to take together and said they had a moderate interaction to take warning to. I figured I'd be fine so I took it about 2 hours ago. Since then I've felt over stimulated, and felt mild paranoia...

It's a weird feeling, not terrible or good, just annoying and I hope it goes away soon.</bodytext></report>
