I started out doing IM shots of Nubain.  It was cool, but my tolerance rose fast.  Then I was introduced to oxy. My first trials with it were IM shots as well.  Started off with just 20mgs at first.  Then like everything, that went up.  Then I started banging it (IV) thats when shit got bad.

I was doing anywhere between 30-60 twenties a week. The withdrawals were horrible.  And the habit cost me everything. Cold sweats, bodY aches, dry heaving...all symptoms of withdrawal.  Not to mention the crazy shit I think about doing to get it.</bodytext></report>
