The unripened seed pods of the Morning Glory reveal a white, much larger, soft seed with some green in the middle of the kernel. I have found that this state of the seeds is more than twice as potent as the black dried seeds.  400 dried is similar to a little less than one hit LSD.  400 fresh is like about 2 or three hits.</bodytext></report>
