I decided to take a test dose of 10-25mg's  for each incoming substance before I gave it to the others. This was ,overall, undeniably enjoyable,but done out of safety, to gauge a base dose and its effects on our little circle.

After this stage MM and I each ate between 40-45 mg's of 4HO MET on a friday night and waited. There was an uneasy come up due to the fact that MM had eaten a quasi bad sandwich an hour before unbeknownst to me. Within 15 minutes I began to feel a strong sensation, colors began changing, the fan took on the characteristics of a tarantula and began its descent on our come up. I was worried and irritated, a wonderful combination on visionary substances, because I was coming up so fast while MM seemed to have no effect but the nausea of that sandwich. As minutes passed the hectic and haphazard transition moved from a worrisome duo on the floor of an office room to a party of colors and lights and an egyptian god moving outside of the house, once again, as large as a school bus.

MM and I fought off the stomach gremlins, and after some time pushed ourselves into the shower. However that very day the bathroom light had blown out. This was to be a very well timed series of events, for a nocturnal shower was something that could not have been better for us. MM wanted to wash her hair as I laid back on the shower wall, the cold white or off white tile material felt so cool to my warm skin. We bumped into each other sillily from time to time, but then came a time where I left myself to drift into the tunnel that was forming in that bathroom shower.

It was pure light, a blank canvas, the sculpture was of a leg, a female leg going up for eternity into a spiral of fractal occurrences, I was free of my body and flying around this giant column. There was a highly erotic element to this part of the voyage, however, my body was in no condition to approach such desires physically. I saw back to my childhood, the 1980's, sitting on a toilet in my second story bathroom, looking into the floor tiles, at these times in my childhood I would imagine a doctor 's office within the shiny metallic fragments that the tiles held within them. This is a place I had been many times before as a supposedly sober child, drifting in my own mind while looking down at the floor or out the window, but not for so many years.

In the shower we bumped around and enjoyed ourselves as two squishy wet beings in a world without light. The adventure went on for what seemed like a blessed eternity, but alas it concluded and we retired to the living room where the peak slowly ran its course. MM reported a much less intense experience than me. Identifying the strongest visual effects as a mask like fractal pattern based on every face she could see.  She reported that things were marked with significant euphoria and glow, but with little to no cognitive manipulation otherwise.

The effects dwindled into the early morning hours, out of fear, I had chosen to come up on this substance in the dusk hours out of some primordial assurance that the sun being up keeps an unfamiliar substance's more insidious tentacles at bey, initially anyway, while I become familiar with it in me for the first time. MM felt this was not needed, and purports that the sun's light may have added to the negatively of the experience in the beginning, but instincts within me persist with the theme that something unknown is best first examined under the sun's light, then explored in the vastness of the dark once it has been properly digested and analyzed.</bodytext></report>
