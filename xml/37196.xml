After taking the dxm I tripped ridiculously hard, but I never once freaked out. It was actually a memorable and enjoyable time for me but the problem occured the next day.

I was at a friend's and I took only a few (maybe 5) bong rips of marijuana. I guess I passed out, which never happens to me on marijuana, and when I awoke my friends had already just left. I was confused and extremely fatigued. I was unable to rationalize why my friends were missing, and I was extremely panicky. I tried to go to the door and I fumbled with the handle. I realized my shoes were untied so I attempted to bend down to tie them but I kept loosing balance and I kept falling into the hallway wall. I fell to the floor and passed out for a moment, everything was darkish and I felt very very fatigued. I crawled to a nearby chair and rested my head on it, when I saw the host of the house was panicking about my actions.

I was really scared, and I got up and stumbled to the door, and ran down stairs. I made it outside into the apartment complex parking lot and ran to a car I thought was my friend's. I began fumbling for the handle on the door while starting to regain my composure and energy levels rose above that of the fatigue I was experiencing. I was yelling my friend's name and eventually I saw headlights and realized where my friends car really was. It took my about 3 minutes to get the door handle and open the car, where I sat in and then felt much better. This may have been a warning sign for narcolepsy, it could have been the lack of sleep from last nights tripping, or it could be a potentially dangerous result of dxm use.</bodytext></report>
