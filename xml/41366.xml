My 'trip' was not very exciting and so this report shall be brief.

My friend and I had read about morning glory online and decided to try it. After looking for various methods of preparation, we settled on tea. We boiled 500 crushed seeds in about 3 cups of water for 10 minutes and drank it... nothing.

6 months later, we decided to try it again. I had read about tinctures using alcohol and apparently they extract effectively. I crushed 750 seeds and immersed them in 3 ounces of vodka in a jar, sealed it and put it in a cool dark place. Shook it up once a day for two weeks. My friend and I each had one ounce of the mixture after the seed remnants were strained off. After waiting three hours we had decided it was ineffective. I'm sorry to say, but my experience with morning glory was nothing at all.</bodytext></report>
