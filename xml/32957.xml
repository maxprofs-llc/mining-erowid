Morphine use having recently become problematic, due to moderate to severe physical dependence through the winter, I withdrew and planned to abstain indefinitely through spring and summer. This abstinence wasn't so broad it included the use of semi-synthetic opioid analgesics such as hydrocodone or oxycodone and the like. Though addictive, even after a month of daily use do not elicit a withdrawal to the likes of plantain opiates (e.g. gagging on my drool and excess mucous and vomiting prolifically while spending and having spent the entire day (and sleepless night) sitting on the toilet urinating out of my chapped asshole in tears.)

I had been sober for a week and a half when a comrade provided me with a quantity of twenty-six 50mg tramadol tablets (ultram) to mitigate the pain of patellar tendonitis. Having taken 600 milligrams in one of my least impressive moments in the past I readily ingested 300 milligrams without reluctance.

The effect is not highly desirable, if even tolerable. The effect is similar to that of methadone (both are wholly synthetic) insofar as it instigates the psychotropic effect of methadone (without the somatropic effect.) The languor or what have you, without muscle tension or comparable physiological symptoms, a much more effective analgesic though (than any opiate), may I suggest anesthetic?

One half-hour after consumption: As the drug became noticeable I was made uncomfortable by recalling how little I had enjoyed the drug in the past and was regretting having taken it so I decided to walk outdoors.

While walking I had been experiencing lapses of cognition, but was not worried. Then, to cite only my own memory, I was bound to a stretcher being loaded into an ambulance while being told that I had endured a minute and a half seizure, and I, not being epileptic or having ever dealt with a seizure before was astounded by the novelty of the situation and was in disbelief.

I was put on oxygen because I had been suffocating, and because I had fallen on my head was having an open wound cleaned. I spent three hours in the hospital and was having cognitive and cognizance disorders for days after. Mind you this was half the dose I had taken before, and substantially less than other antecedent trials.</bodytext></report>
