As I read the following I thought, wow you should try this, seems not that neurotoxic like amphetamine.

Well I took 300mg, and waited about one hour. Nothing. Took another Tbl. with 300mg. Again nothing. Then I thought, well take one more, and if its still inactive resell it to someone else. So I took another 300mg.

Waited, and waited, and the only thing that happened was, I was getting extremely tired, but was unable to sleep. Very unpleasant.

So my suggestion is, for everyone who searches for something that keeps you awake, take Yohimbine-HCL instead - Not Adrafinil. This medication is in my opinion totaly useless. No idea who put this on the pharma market.
