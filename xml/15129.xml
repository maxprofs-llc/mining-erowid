Substance - 2C-I
/n
/n
Experience - First time
/n
/n
Setting - my house, solo
/n
/n
I was in a mediocre state of mind. I had just had a rough night at work. It was 1045pm and I looked at the capsule containing 16mg of 2C-I in it. I quickly down it with a swish of Code Red Mountain Dew. I then sat back to play the waiting game.
/n
/n
I had fasted for about 6 hours before this point in hope to make a swifter comeup. My stomach was rumbling with hunger.
/n
/n
1045PM - 16mg ingested orally
/n
/n
1050PM - I feel a tightness in my stomach. I had not read anything about naseau so I asked fellow IRC users. They said it was the phenethylamine signature. I myself had never had a phen of any sort so I wasnt sure of this. But I dismissed any alarm I had.
/n
/n
12AM - Feel alert, I also feel... itchy is the only way I can describe. Much like a feather is being rubbed gently all over my body. A very pleasant body feel.
/n
/n
1210AM - No visuals present, but I am starting to come up fast. But still the effects are not too powerful, I could still function should I need to.
/n
I was speaking to a person whom I go to for advice, and he said that I should try to smoke a little to boost it more. I had read of smoking 2c's and heard it was quite gentle. I decided to try 5mg to see if it did anything at all.
/n
/n
1215AM - Vaporize 5mg of 2C-I in a test tube.
/n
/n
1220AM - I go back on the computer. Smoking definitely boosted the experience. My body high is tremendous at this point. It feels almost as tho I was having an orgasm throughout my body. It actually makes me shudder every few mins.
/n
/n
1AM - Slight visual disturbances. Things seem to be far away or real close. Depth perception means nothing right now.
/n
/n
130AM - Still coming up, very strong body buzz, but still very gentle... 
/n
/n
My previous experience with AMT had been rather bizarre. The body buzz was strong and made me feel weird at times. The 2C-I feel, although definitely bizarre in its own way, was very gentle, and I never felt out of place.
/n
/n
2AM - I think Im peaking now. Visuals are powerful. Slight patterning is present, but only slight. The real visual effects are that my entire vision looks as though I was looking through a piece of bent glass. Everything is very warped, and glistening. 
/n
/n
At this point I can hear my parents stirring in the room next to where I am. I dont think I would handle a visit from them well, so I retreat to my basement where my room is. 
/n
/n
215AM - I go into the bathroom to look in the mirror. I love mirrors on trip, they are so frightening and so fun at the same time. Anytime I made a happy face, my skin seemed to change color, and I looked absolutely beautiful. I was the best looking person that ever lived. But when I made a sad/angry face... my face warped and contorted, and took on a greenish hue. My eyes seemed to sink back and my teeth seemed to look like fangs. I dismissed this as a hallucination though and left the bathroom.
/n
/n
216AM - On the way out I notice we have a whipped cream can in the fridge... hmmm...
/n
/n
218AM - I suck down the nitrous. Holy shit, what can I say?... I was literally nullified from this world. I saw bizarre images pouring through my head while my body separated from me. I felt as though I was completely and utterly lost in a sea of color and thoughts... for about 2 mins hehe
/n
/n
220AM - Nitrous is over... wow...
/n
/n
230AM - Put on headphones and lay on my bed. Listening to Dark Side Of The Moon. People tell me its cliche, but I still love it. Always puts me in a positive mood.
/n
/n
245AM - Listening to Floyd and watching my room breathe with slight patterns still flowing  
/n
/n
3AM - At this point my mind was gone... I had random thoughts I had never thought before (and now cannot recall) pour through my head. With my eyes closed I saw images dancing behind my eyes. It was a powerful vision/thought.
/n
/n
315AM - Still watching visual effects... I have found that if I resist... no matter how intense it gets, I can seem to suppress all the effects. But for the most part I am allowing the chemical to take over and do its magical work.
/n
/n
430AM - Coming down now... still feeling great. The body orgasm is STILL there. This was the greatest body high I have ever felt from any substance I have taken. Visuals are still bending around the room.
/n
/n
5AM - I try to force myself to sleep... not a good idea... Trying to push all this out (despite what I said before) is too hard. The more I try to sleep, the more intense the CEVs get. After awhile of trying I give up and just lay there.
/n
/n
530AM - I hear a crash... I go upstairs and see that my cat knocked a vase over. I pick it up. I then go into the bathroom to see the mirror again... yep, Im still having strong hallucinations.
/n
/n
545AM - My stomach is hurting now, its been about 12 hours since I ate. I pour a bowl of cereal and eat it. It tastes so very good. I turn around and open the blinds, and I witness the most breath-taking site I have ever seen. The sunrise...
/n
/n
I had only seen the sun come up a few times before, but now, while on 2C-I it meant so much more. It symbolized a new beginning. It was at this point that the eye of my mind opened widely, and I just about fathomed everything I had ever wondered about, revelations about my life were flowing through my head, making me so very happy.
/n
/n
And then I hear footsteps...
/n
/n
My mom comes down wondering why Im up at 545. I said I heard the cat and then I wanted food. She sat down with me and started to talk to me about random stuff. Eeek... I do not enjoy talking to my parents on any drug, let alone a hallucinogen...
/n
/n
Time to try if I can push it...
/n
/n
Yes! Its working...
/n
/n
6AM - I managed to get through the convo. And then she asked me to drive out the get the morning paper. Shit, I thought. I cant drive like this. I was still tripping, not nearly as hard as before, but still enough where I would never drive. I say I dont feel good from lack of food, and she goes out.
/n
/n
615AM - I take a shower. Oh god, how wonderful this feels. I look at the shower curtain, and it is breathing. Its been 7.5 hours since ingestion, and Im still seeing visuals? Wow...
/n
/n
630AM - I go on IRC. To my surprise people are still on and active. I talk to them for a bit.
/n
/n
8AM - Effects seem to have left me completely, a total of 9.5 hours after ingestion I feel normal  
/n
/n
What a great experience
/n
/n
----------------------------
/n
Side effects - I had read of a raise in blood pressure. When it all wore off I had a tightness in my face, and my jaw hurt from clenching. I was tired from lack of sleep, but that was to be expected. 
/n
/n
The effects on my mind were fantastic. I have never had a more introspective trip in my life. This had everything I have ever looked for in a drug. From the fantastic visuals, to the nice body feel, to the completely blissful mind this was my best drug experience to date.
/n
/n
In the future I think I will try smoking 2C-I by itself to see how the effects of that go.
/n
/n
2C-I was a very powerful beautiful chemical. Please treat this one with respect.</bodytext></report>
