0:00 Friend and I each consume ~20 mg (first measured with a cheap scale, eyed-out after that) of 6-APB powder in capsules. Starting low to determine threshold.
/n
/n
0:15 Perception is slighty different. Friend feels slightly euphoric, while I do not.
/n
/n
0:45 We both consume another ~25 mg. Notice a very strong chemical smell/taste, despite it being in capsules.
/n
/n
0:50 Friend has alcoholic drink, I have Red Bull and water.
/n
/n
1:00 Music does not seem to be enhanced by substance, nor mood. It seems to just be a 'little extra something,' very mild. No tactile sensations. Things are sparkling in a way that reminds me of 2c-x substances, most distinctly 2c-c.
/n
/n
2:00 I make the decision to drive us home, because friend has to be awake early the next day. I've consumed no alcohol. Friend has consumed ~3 drinks. /n
/n
/n
Friend consumes another ~50 mg. Music seems to be slightly enhanced. No tactile sensations.
/n
/n
2:15 Friend describes what she is feeling as 'the strongest roll I've ever had in my life, if I didn't know for sure this wasn't MDMA, that's what I would think it is.' She mentions mild nausea, which could possibly be attributed to being in the car.
/n
/n
3:00 We return home. I consume ~30 mg. 
/n
/n
4:00 Out of nowhere, I go from feeling almost nothing to the most incredibly loved-up sensation I can imagine. Tactile sensations are moderately euphoric. Eye-wiggles present. My heart is beating at a high rate, but not uncomfortably so. Exactly as my friend had described, I feel as if I have taken MDMA, plus the mild-to-moderate visuals. Only slight disturbance in thought patterns, which may be attributed to being extremely overtired.
/n
/n
6:30 Feel myself starting to come down. No crash. Very slight headache, slight gastrointestinal discomfort. No nausea.
/n
/n
7:30 Euphoria is completely gone. Slight visuals (less noticeable than before) remain; seems to be an enhancement of my pre-existing HPPD.
/n
/n
Friend feels very achy and nauseous, is unable to sleep.
/n
/n
8:00 Able to fall asleep quickly and comfortably.
/n
/n
12:00 Wake up. Very tired, visuals still lingering. No 'crash' feeling, no depression, no afterglow.
/n
/n
All in all, I am incredibly impressed by this substance. After reading other reports, I had not expected nearly such a pleasant experience.  Very enjoyable entactogen, less stimulating than MDMA.</bodytext></report>
