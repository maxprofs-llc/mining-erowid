I wrote a poem about my experience on MDMA at a rave, who knows, I just took it about 13 hours ago.
/n
/n
this endless bliss...
/n
it's like everything is beautiful 
/n
and I am innocent...
/n
It's as though all is joy 
/n
and I can feel ...   
/n
The being of others
/n
The being of myself  
/n
The being of the world and all it's people
/n
and everything is close to me 
/n
 and beautiful and 
/n
 I am innocent and I am happy 
/n
bliss of bliss this endless bliss this perfect state of being
/n
this comes from a pill..... 
/n
this endless bliss....</bodytext></report>
