Fruit salad as a breakfast and very light lunch were today's preparations for the evening.

18.35 I dropped a capsule with 55mg of tma-2. A friend of mine, call him P1, took 64mg, another (P2) 45mg and third friend 40mg (P3). Fourth friend, P4, had taken a little acid earlier. We were at my friends flat sitting on sofas and surrounded by loudspeakers. Flat's owner had prepared a long set of music for the night. The music started and we sat down to chat while waiting for the sacrament to take effect.

19.10 P1 told that he is melting into sofa. I wasn't feeling anything yet.

19.40 I begin to feel the effects now. I go to kitchen to have a glass of water and moving is wavy. Everything that I look at seems to be closer than it really is. Room is large and my vision is sharp.

20.00 The music begins to turn very interesting and I can forget most of the outside world by closing eyes and concentrating on music. I look at the silhouettes of trees through the window. They have become alive, all branches squirming and swirling like an ant hive. Busy trees. Physical feeling is getting extremely sedated, even lethargic. Moving limbs take enormous effort and because of this, we tend to stay still. I am closing the peak with a nice pace.

20.15 Music has turned its character. The music P1 chose to play is very information rich, full of small sounds, glitches, noises and cracks. They fill my head and form very electrically flowing textures that don't seem like just sounds anymore. As soon as I close my eyes I am lost in this flow. Everything, all of my consciousness, begin to go round in circles, music feeding the circus constantly with new information. Eyes closed I cannot tell anymore where I am. Friends, the flat, everything outside these circles keep drifting further and further. Music, smells, images, they all begin to get a form of one unified sensory input flow that circles in space that used to be my mind.

20.40 Something happens. Everything that has been going around in me finds a proper place. All images and thoughts going around my head were a process of finding a correct combination of things, which unlocks something. This something feels like white energy flowing through me. It seems to originate somewhere inside my own body and it flows in all directions at once. It seems to purify me, it feels refreshing. I stretch every now and then, it makes me feel better. When I open my eyes, I have slight difficulties in adjusting to my real world surroundings. Everything seems spacious, yet intimate and close. I find it hard to believe that it has been only 2 hours into this experience now. It is amazing.

Sometimes the music has a sudden break. P1 made that on purpose to wake us back from the deeps and it sure does that. I am mostly unaware of other people's goings. I go to kitchen to take a mandarin, but peeling it turns out to be too difficult a task. Luckily P4 is not as high and he peels it in no time. I eat half the mandarin and give the other half to others. Mandarin tastes like nothing else before. It is like the first mandarin I have ever eaten.

22.00 I have not eaten lunch, dinner or any other full dish all day. I am still very high, but I was also becoming weak. I have to eat heavier food soon. I fry three eggs and eat them with some rice pie. I feel much better soon after eating.

I visit nearby shop to buy some more mandarins. In the flat I had not noticed anything very special about the faces of my friends, but in the shop I see all strangers and their faces morphing constantly. All small gestures they make are exaggarated as if stripped out from a cartoon or a grotesque painting. The cashier looks as if this was the last work he would like to do in the whole world. His arms twist and stretch when he takes money and gives change.

Soon after that we decide to have a walk outside. Fresh air feels good and we wander through the city for two hours, stopping to grab some pizza and watching ducks swimming in the river. Ducks reminds of how most people are, going around life like ducks swim in circles. We arrive back to the apartment around 01.30 and by that time I am down considerably. The rest of the night we spend discussing what has happened. We go to bed after 5am and I sink into sleep through colourful visions sometime before 6am. The next day is bright, happy and I feel refreshed.

Conclusion, to me tma-2 is simply excellent material. It was quite 
/n
lethargic at the peak, but mentally very clear and flowing. It was not pushing me much anywhere, but given the right circumstances, like we had, closing eyes and concentrating got me very deep. The trip seemed to change its character some halfway through the trip. Some of my friends had very strong experiences too, although the cannabis that they smoked all the time helped also. This was good amount, but if I would have to spend any longer time at some social enviroment where are outsiders, I'd have to take less or uncomfortable moments would be unavoidable. There is not much more I can say, it can take me to there.</bodytext></report>
