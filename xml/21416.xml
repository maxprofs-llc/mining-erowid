This happened a couple times of doing this, nothing too serious, but unpleasant nonetheless....I started taking mini-thins to make work go by fast, and I would take two when I got to work, and two at the end of work, or else I'd need a nap when I got home.....What happened after a while was I started getting muscle pains.

I think the deal was, I was a receiver, taking in shipments, and I would tear muscles daily and not feel it on ephedrine. After a while, it would build up, and every muscle in my body would give me sharp pains. They would last about a week and heal, but I do not recommend taking minithins or any ephedrine supplement regularly for any long span of time for the risk of fucking up your body seriously. I say if you take them, keep it to a once in a while thing, not a daily thing.</bodytext></report>
