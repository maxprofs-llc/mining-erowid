I have been experiencing medium to intense headaches for about 1 1/2 years as of now (11/02).  I most often notice the headaches when reading, watching a movie, or working on the computer.  When they are at their strongest point, I cannot read or look at something any longer.  It seems as though there is tremendous pressure in my eyes or like my eye muscles are completely sore and tired.  I have been to doctors numerous times, but they cannot find the problem.

Recently, I have found complete relief from these headaches by using psilocybin.  Some times the relief lasts several days - maybe up to a week.  I also found that DMT also works at low dosages (10-30mg).  I wonder...Has anyone else found relief in these substances?  Does anyone use these or other medications on a regular basis to control headaches?
