It was a typical saturday night. A night with four 30 packs of beer with me and my buddies. We were drinking and my friend happened to have a prescription of 1mg Xanax. He brought them along. Now I never really messed with pills before, but I figured what the hell. I snorted two 1mg xanaxs and continued drinking beer. Well, I woke up the next morning next to an ex girlfriend. What I do remember is one of the best feelings in the world. Complete happiness. Just don't over do it people. I was one happy camper that night.</bodytext></report>
