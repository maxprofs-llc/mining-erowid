I have been taking tramadol recreationally now for almost a year and when the dose is high enough, and when I am relaxed, lying down, the sensation on my skin, (mainly my feet and legs) is absolutely incredible!  Perhaps the greatest sensation of physical pleasure I can experience.

I have built up a tolerance to 30 pills a day.  Once I had reached this, I thought I had better quit.  I am on day 5 and hating it.  I have tried Valium, Codeine and Dextromethorphan to relieve the symptoms but basically I am stuck until my body gets rid of it.  I never thought it would be so bad but this drug ought to be extremely controlled.  I got mine OTC in Mexico and very cheaply too.  I usually start with an initial 4 pills, then an hour later 4 more.  Then, every hour increase up until about 20 pills.

By the time I get into bed, my body is just surging with ecstasy.  Wave after wave of pleasure just sweeps over me. It must really enhance the pleasure nerves.  For some reason, in me, the most pleasure is centered on the bottom of my left foot and sensations can be felt well into the next day. I feel like cuddling and hugging everyone after ingestion.</bodytext></report>
