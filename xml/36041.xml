About 3 months ago, shrooms started sweeping through my town like wildfire. They never really had come around too often (I had tripped once about 2 years ago, and not again until about 2 months ago, although I really wanted to). They came in the form of chocolates with shroom paste inside; each chocolate had 1/8th of an ounce in it. When I first heard about them, I spent about $100 and tripped 3 or 4 times, and stuck one chocolate in my freezer. The times that I tripped were great, don't get me wrong, but I have never experienced anything like I did the other night. The first times were more of an emotional, enlightening kind of trip that just made me feel great about my life and everything in it. I mean everything. Even the thought of my mom telling me to not drive drunk made me ridiculously happy. I have no idea why.

So anyway, the other day, I remembered about the one remaining chocolate in my freezer. By now, the shroom wave is long gone from my town, so I felt fortunate to have stashed something so cleverly. I am 17 and about to start my senior year of high school, so I felt that tripping alone would bring me a sense of comfort and relief with my life that one needs to start something like school. I had about 1 gram of cannabis, which I planned to smoke in my bro's bong. He had left it under a bench in the woods about .5 mile from my house, a very short bike ride. I ate the chocolate, chugged a glass of orange juice, put my headphones on, and was on my way.

The sun had just set, and the sky was a dark purple kind of color. By the time I reached the bench, it had been about 15 minutes since I consumed the shroom. I decided to sit and close my eyes and prepare for what was about to happen. I listened to the night sounds of the woods and felt deeply contented. After about 20 more minutes, I felt I was ready to smoke.

I smoked about 1g in the water pipe, after which I felt tremendously high. Plus, I knew the shrooms were about to kick in, so I was very excited. I reached under the bench to replace the bong, when my already high brain realized that I had stumbled upon a CD book. Someone had just left their CDs out in the woods, and it was most certainly not my bro. Curious, I opened it and took out a CD which I had never seen before. I popped it in my discman and pressed play. What came out of the headphones was some of the most amazing music I have ever heard. It was techno, and I have never been a techno fan, but this music was so complex, if I was not tripping, I would never, ever have understood the amazing beats. It sounded so incredible, I was unable to move.

By this time, strange waves of motion seemed to wash through my vision, and waves of indescribable emotion washed over my body. The second track started, and I realized that the chirpings of birds, frogs, whatever is out in the woods, was matching perfectly with the music. I mean perfectly. I listened hard for about 10 minutes, and I was positive that it was all synchronized. Then I realized that not only were the two sounds synchronized, but that every sound and motion that is made are all synchronized. I tested my hypothesis by trying to walk out of the rhythm, but I couldn't. I threw a spare battery I had, and the way it bounced and rolled matched the beat perfectly.

This is when I was struck by the impulse to ride the bike back to my house. It is not that I was frightened by the timing of nature, I just felt a stirring that called me home. I returned home to find my 12 year old brother playing a video game about the show Dragonball Z. I have never really been interested in this before, but suddenly, the plot lines moved me to no end. I felt a deep sense of connection with the characters, their lives and deaths, and the amazing sense of honor that mostly only fictional characters have.

I played this game with my brother for about an hour, during which time I kind of 'forgot' I was supposed to be rolling. I got up to take the most pleasurable piss of my life, and when I looked in the mirror above the sink, all hell broke loose. I saw that my pupils were the size of quarters, which caused me to examine my face more closely. I looked and saw the freckles shimmering into a rainbow of colors, then they all started melting together into shining streams. I also noticed that someone had sprayed some kind of foamy water on the mirror which had long since dried into tiny spots that I had never noticed until now.

The spots slowly started shining, like little light bulbs, and swirling around my body. I saw myself as the center of some kind of microcosm. As I stared agape at this mini-galaxy that had formed in my bathroom, I noticed that everything seemed like it was slowly being pulled into the mirror, like someone on the other side had pulled a bathtub drain. Even my face was horribly stretched out towards the mirror, like it was getting sucked in. 'What the fuck?!?!' I desperately asked myself, and for one horrible moment, my soul felt like it was tearing itself apart as my conscious brain tried to seperate from my 'mind' which was tripping. I felt my body trying to fight something which was inevitable, as I desperately racked my brain for a solution.

The physical pain of having my brain feel like it was ripping was becoming unbearable, and I was still getting sucked into the mirror. Suddenly, a voice in my head screamed 'Roll with it, fool!' I instantly remembered the wise words of one of my friends, who said 'Remember, there is nothing that your mind can't handle on mushrooms. LSD can really take you too far sometimes, but shrooms never get out of control.' As I realized this, I released my body into the vortex, and suddenly I felt like I was floating. The pain stopped, and it actually felt wonderful.

In this moment of weightlessness, I saw in one instant everything that had happened in my life, and everything that would happen. It wasn't even a vision, it was just a feeling that I had for one second that somehow managed to describe my entire life perfectly, even things that hadn't happened yet. I can't even describe what it was, or how it affected me, I know I am just much changed for the better because of it. I believe that every person must break through a similar kind of barrier that allows them to truly understand things. It was difficult and frightening to accept what psilocybin was trying to show me, but because I gave in, I finally saw with a new set of eyes.</bodytext></report>
