First off, this will not be a very objective report because my experience of time was rendered totally nonlinear for the majority of the experience. I am fairly experienced with dissociatives, having tried DXM, nitrous oxide, 4-meo-PCP and extensive experience with ketamine, so I hope I am able to provide some insight into the nature of this chemical compared to others, mainly ketamine.

I started off the day with 400mg of SAMe, an antidepressant supplement and 3 grams of piracetam. I don't think either of these played a very significant role in my experience.

After playing music most of the day I decided to start the experience around 6:30 pm. I ate a 2.5 gram blue penis envy psilocybin mushroom. In the last few months whenever I do dissociative drugs I like to combine them with a psychedelic to guide me through the trip. I think of dissociatives as opening a vast and dark void, an inner space and I see the psychedelics as bringing a certain light and guidance to this space. I chose the mushroom because it gives me a feeling of being connected to the earth and something ancient, while dissociatives give me the feeling of being connected to space, technology and the future. I relaxed for about half an hour listening to music with no effects from the mushrooms yet.

Around 7:00 pm I decided to try my first line of methoxetamine. I had several measured lines of 50mg each on a glass plate. I divided one line into two roughly 25mg bumps and snorted one. Waited about ten or fifteen minutes and only felt a vague feeling of heaviness so I did the second one. Around 7:30 I got up to go to the bathroom and definitely felt like gravity was stronger but didn't notice much of anything mental. I have done plenty of ketamine in the past so I may have somewhat of a perma tolerance to related substances. I did another 50mg and the psychological effects started. Sometimes the dissociative effects kind of come through the back door of the mind, I think I feel pretty normal and then I try and do some simple task and realize I am severely altered. One of my friends came over somewhat unexpectedly to talk to me. I was able to think about what I wanted to say but I could only speak very slowly. Language seemed very incongruent with reality.

We agreed to meet up again another day since I was unable to communicate. With ketamine I can usually still talk although the words come out non linear and fragmented. With methoxetamine I could barely talk at all. I went back downstairs and did a third line. Now at 150mg I was almost totally unable to comprehend outside information. One of my roommates started playing the drums very loud downstairs which startled me. My other roommate came in and told me his cat had a severe heart problem and was in the vet and might die. The third roommate came in the room and turned on the TV to MTV, specifically the show jersey shore. To me this situation was an incomprehensible hurricane of information. I wanted to console my roommate about his cat but I couldnt talk. The television was blaring over saturated nonsense that seemed like a horrifying cultural vomit of information. The walls started to breathe with neon energy and I could tell the mushrooms were kicking in.

The come up on mushrooms can often be confusing and overwhelming and usually leads to some kind of moral introspection about my life, so this combined with the onslaught of information was too much. I got up and staggered around the room, looking at the tv and then back at my roommates over and over. My roommate lead me downstairs where he got out his sitar which has a contact mic on it so you can plug it into an amplifier. This is where the perception of time was lost. The basement looked gigantic. probably three or four times its actual size. It is littered with cords from electronic instruments but the cords seemed to stetch on for miles, intertwined with everything in the room. My roommate started to play the sitar, the other the drums. I was overtaken by beauty with the music they were playing. I felt totally ecstatic and I was unable to tell if I was also playing music with them or not. I was just lying still on the floor. I had a great feeling of spiritual transcendence. There seemed to be infinite meaning in the sound of the sitar, it glowed with a pure light. The song seemed to go on forever, but when they finally stopped playing I told them I thought it was beautiful. I was almost near crying. My room mate talked for a while about existence, biology and technology and mused about how ridiculous of a time it is to be alive, he did most of the talking of course.

I went back upstairs and noticed I had some trouble moving my muscles, felt like the sideways gravity of ketamine but not as severe. My girlfriend came home and told me she had a very stressful day. I was unable to console her and unable to understand the story of her day, which made me feel guilty. We lay in bed together for a while and I was able to console her by cuddling with her instead of talking which was very calming. She had to go to sleep so I went to my room.

I decided to do more methoxetamine to further explore. I wandered around the room for a while and then weighed out 100mg. Double checked the weight and then snorted half of it. Barely felt anything so I snorted the other half. Still the effects were minimal. This happens to me with ketamine, each time I do it the tolerance goes up faster. I got out the bag and just eyeballed another line as the 100mg was not very noticeable. Now it was working again.

I turned off the lights and sat cross legged on the floor. I began to meditate as I have been doing daily in the past months. This was greatly centering and I saw an ocean of blue blinking information through my closed eyelids. I thought about technology and consciousness and biology, all subjects seamlessly relating to one another, a great web of existence. This part of the experience is somewhat hard to describe and I'm not sure how long it lasted. It had some ecstatic parts and some nightmare like parts, but overall was balanced. After a while of drifting through this information I decided to lay down and try to sleep. I felt very awake and was totally unable to sleep. I did another unmeasured line around 3 or 4 am. I realized I wouldnt be sleeping and just sat smoking pot. The sun came up and my cat came to the window to listen to the sounds outside. I watched him listen and felt a strange connection to him, like I was hearing everything he was. This was very peaceful and pleasant.

Eventually my girlfriend got up for work, and I was very glad to see her. I felt very centered, the afterglow feeling that some dissociatives can create after they wear off. I told her that I thought my experience had been therapeutic, cathartic. I compared it to defragmenting a hard drive, taking my mind apart and putting it back together in a more intentional way. I do think this drug could have therapeutic value and the kind of 'death and rebirth' therapy. I did feel reborn. I felt clean, even though I was still a little wacked out. I took a shower and noticed that my lips looked purple and blue like I had been doing nitrous oxide. This was verified by my sober girlfriend and was somewhat concerning as I had read one trip report of this drug where the user described problems with breathing. I didnt notice any problems subjectively but the blue lips definitely made it seem like I was a little oxygen deprived.

I was unable to sleep till about noon of the next day when I smoked a DMT-laced joint for one last peek of the world I had visited the night before. The DMT was very calming and I felt relaxed coming down from it and finally faded into sleep. I slept from noon to 9:30 PM. I ate a big dinner and fell asleep again from 11:00 PM to 10:00 AM the next day.

When I woke up I still felt a bit tired and waked out, having a mild but persistent headache. I felt increased sensitivity to light and some irritability upon going out into public, although the pleasant insights of the trip remained. This hangover effect was much stronger and longer lasting than if I had just done a bunch of ketamine.

All in all this drug is very interesting and unique, almost more confusing than ketamine in my opinion. It definitely was not as euphoric or fun as ketamine. I've also read of people describing this drug as having opiate like effects, I didn't have any nodding, itching or warm blanket over the body sensations akin to opiates.</bodytext></report>
