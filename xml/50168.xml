Sitting alone one day I decided to do something that seems unusual. I came across a sample pack of Viagra (6, 50mg. pills), and remembered something about a change in colors. I said why the hell not and downed them all...and indeed...it was slightly interesting. There were many noticeable changes in the color of things, most noticeably a blushish tint. But most notable was the fact that every time I looked at something a shift in the light occurred (dark became darker, light became brighter)... it definitely felt like a very low dose of acid.</bodytext></report>
