Tried the Sinicuichi as a tea.  Very interesting indeed! After making the tea, my wife and I sat down and guzzled it down.  No noticable effects, other then the fact that my wife and I became very relaxed and drowsy.  I started thinking about my grandfather who had passed away, my wife never met him and I never really talked about him to her. We both slept very well.  That night, I dreamt about my grandfather, and for some odd reason, my wife did, too, even though she never met him - wierd.  Anyhow, we woke up with a side effect that I never read about on-line here. We both slept very well, but woke up with every muscle in our body very sore, almost like how you'd feel if you ran 10 miles without excersing or stretching before hand.  The effects went away with some motrin.  No yellowing or vision or any other effects that were supposed to happen.  I'd try it again as a sleep aid, and dream inducer, worked great.</bodytext></report>
