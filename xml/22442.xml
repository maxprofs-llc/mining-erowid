 Last Sunday (3/23/03) I experimented with 25mg of Foxy.  At about 3:30pm I took 25mg by capsule being warned that I would feel something in about 20 minutes.  I had eaten 3 hours prior to this.  A friend who was not on foxy was with me and she drove us to an outdoor 'peace themed' rave.  We arrived at 4pm.  Still nothing.

I proceeded to walk around the event and listen to the speakers speak out against government and war and started to feel a bit nauseous.  I decided I needed to sit down.  As I was sitting down, I started looking around at all of the attendees at this event.  Many of them were dressed strangely (brightly colored clothes and costumes) and there was a man walking around on stilts.  I was still feeling a normal reaction to seeing these things.  Its about 4:30pm now and I'm still feeling nauseous and I'm talking to my friend next to me and I start to notice that she is slightly yellow looking to me where she wasnt before and I began to look around at the other people here and started to think 'are all ravers this weird looking or am I on drugs' still having a pretty solid belief that what I had ingested wasnt going to work.

I attempted to stand up at this point to test my nausea and the music started at the same time, all of a sudden I felt as if I had  been dropped into this party, as if it simply wasnt there before.  I started to notice the gray cement to be slightly more colorful to me and the walls of the local building appearing to be more shiny and marble like when it had been unremarkable before.  I proceeded to begin to dance and notice that I was moving in a different way than I normally dance and then began to realize that something was going on.

I danced for a while (nausea gone) pausing to notice the slight changes going on all around me and my impressions of these changes to change.  The visuals I began to see and the changes in perspective of people walking by me changed.  The distortions I was seeing on peoples faces I began, on some level to believe that people really looked this way and I just hadnt noticed before.  As my experience continued to get more and more intense I began sitting down more and just watching people.  The music sounded awesome to me and I was really enjoying it.

Then at 6pm the rave ended and my friend and I began to walk along the local stores and restaurants and went into one to get a bite to eat (she was hungry).  We sat down and I was handed a menu.  It took me a minute to realize what I was supposed to do with the menu.  I ordered some mozzarella sticks and I knew I was supposed to put what was in front of me in my mouth and chew but I didnt really know why.  So I didnt eat them.  I went to reach for my water and saw my hand reach for it 3 more times then I had.

There were many people in this restaurant and all of the noises were coming to me as separate noises.  The music in the other room would come and then fade with voices coming and fading also After that we got in her car and she drove back to her apartment, this part made me  rather nervous although I didnt feel I would die I just felt we would crash.

We arrived at her house and I sat on the couch.  The experience seemed to be dropping off at this point; nothing to visually exciting and it was about 7:30pm or so at this point.  While the visuals seem to be dying, the mental trip was increasing.  My friend and I were discussing politics and I was having a hard time understanding and talking.  We then left to go to another party, and my mental trip was getting more and more intense.  While everyone was sitting and watching dancers on stage, I was wandering around the back and through the building, getting easily lost.

I came across a restroom and went in there only because it was the only familiar thing around me but that didnt help. Everything was foreign and amazing and strange to me.  I went outside and attempted to smoke a cigarette, hoping that would put a perspective of normality in my mind.  Seeing my own hand rise to my mouth for the cigarette was strange, my own skin looked yellow and puffy and I believed that was really the way I looked  A woman sitting  next to me smoking also, turned to me and asked if the smoke from her cigarette was blowing in my face.

What I heard from her mouth was smoke face yours blow into? Which made no sense until she repeated herself. After this my friend came out and we sat down in the parking lot with a few people.  Everyone around me was talking but nothing made sense.  By now it is 10:30pm and Ive had to ask everyone to repeat themselves 3 times in order to follow the conversation.  While I was sitting and staring at the cracks in the ground.  Finally we went home and at 12:30pm I drove home from her place.  It took until 12:30pm for me to know that that was what I needed to do, I realized only then that I had work the next day.

So I drove home, a 30min drive and arrived home a little after one and laid down.  I was still experiencing residual visual and mental affects at this point and only maybe got a few hours of sleep before I had to get up at 6:30am the next day.  The affects lasted for a total of 12 hours before I could really sleep.</bodytext></report>
