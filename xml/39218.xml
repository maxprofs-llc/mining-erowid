To start, let me give you my brief psychoactive history:
/n
/n
-Pot (All the time;  from mellowed out, to outer space)
/n
-DXM (4 or 5 times; unenjoyable)
/n
-Codeine/Perc/Vicodin (roughly 15 times; fun fun fun!)
/n
-Mushrooms (3 times; completely changed my life for the better)
/n
-Alcohol
/n
-Tobacco (semi-regularly)
/n
-Dimenhydrinate (with no hallucinations)

The night started with a trip to the grocery store.  I was originally there to pick up a few legit items (bread, milk, eggs), but made a quick detour to the 'natural lifestyle' section, coming across a bottle of 40 pills, each containing 400mg Yohimbe and 200mg Vitamin C.  I made the purchase, came home, and read more on Yohimbe.
/n

As you probably know, Yohimbe is a stimulant, aphrodisiac, and sometimes used to treat cases of erectile dysfunction.  The aphrodisiac properties were what interested me, as my girlfriend L and I both enjoyed other forms of inebriated sex.  Mindset: curious, overall positive.
/n
/n
T=0:00 - Ingest two pills, orally, with plenty of water.
/n
/n
T=0:30 - Not feeling anything, drop one more.
/n
/n
T=1:30 - Increased heart rate, slight anxiety, over all a lot like a high dose of caffeine.
/n
/n
T=2:00 L gets off work, and we decide to go to a movie.  I tell her about the Yohimbe; she's very interested, and asks me how it feels.  I tell her I'm speedy, but find it to be more un-arousing than anything else.  I drop two more Yohimbe capsules, and 1 25mg Diphenhydramine pill to cut the edge.
/n
/n
T=2:30 I have a good balance of energy going.  The Yohimbe gives energy, and the Diphenhydramine takes away the unpleasant anxiety and heart-jumping.  I'll try not to be graphic, but for the sake of science, I was also harder (and maybe a little bit bigger) than I've ever been in my entire life.  L commented on this too, and LOVED it.  Oral sex felt INCREDIBLE (more than usual).
/n
/n
T=3:30 We arrive at the theater too late, and decide to bring a movie back home.  En route, we have sex.  Once again, very very very good.
/n
/n
T=7:30 It's about midnight, L goes home.  I don't think sleeping will be a problem.
/n
/n
T=9:00 Sleeping is a problem.  I lie in bed with racing thoughts, and although my heart rate is only slightly elevated, I can not sleep.
/n
/n
T=9:30 25mg Diphenhydramine ingested, my last one.  
/n
/n
T=10:00 Shallow sleep for 6 hours.
/n
/n
SUMMARY:
/n
Although the stimulant and aphrodisiac properties of Yohimbe were fun, I can only imagine what this is doing to damage my heart.  Not sleeping was no fun either; I'm writing this the morning after and I feel run-down.  Diphenhydramine worked perfectly for me, and I know I could have gotten to sleep if I had had 25-50mg more to take before going to bed.</bodytext></report>
