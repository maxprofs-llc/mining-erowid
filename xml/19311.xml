Experience  Second time
/n
Setting  my friends basement
/n
/n
I had an /n which did not turn out so well.  30mg insufflated by myself resulted in the worst terror I have ever experienced ever.  Also, there was much physical discomfort as well.  I was curious as to why such a low dose induced such powerful effects.  I decided it had to be one of three things.
/n
/n
1. I am very sensitive to DPT
/n
2. I underestimated its power
/n
3. I was not in a good setting
/n
/n
The main purpose of this trip was to see if my reaction would be the same, or if the setting would alter it.
/n
/n
I usually trip by myself, which is what I did on my previous trip.  Tonight I decided to try with a friend who was also interested in DPT.  His experience only included one mushroom trip, but he seemed to be as prepared as one could ever be.  I decided to try 30mg again with people to see if having others there could change the feel of the trip.  My friend requested the same dose.  Having suspected that my reaction was a sensitivity, I decided he would probably be okay at 30mg.
/n
/n
We arrived at my friends house at 9 PM.  I burned incense (which I have begun doing at the beginning of all trips) and we just sat and talked to each other for a moment.  We then both decided it was time to begin the adventure.
/n
/n
915PM  M and myself each snort a 30mg pile of DPT.  There is no burn or foul smell, which is what I noticed last time too.  I sat back and prepared myself further.  I felt some fear, but it was more a fear of what happened last time, rather than of what was to come.
/n
/n
920PM  Drip already.  Its even worse than I imagined it being.  I drink some soda in hopes of removing the taste from my throat.  It works well.
/n
/n
925PM  The room already looks much sharper.  I feel very spacy.  M reports similar feelings.  The people around us just watched.  They kept asking how we were doing.  I just responded Im fine
/n
/n
940PM  Definitely effects now.  I feel as though I am sinking into the chair Im in.  M is laughing foolishly and rocking back and forth on a bed.  I ask how he is, and he responds with great.
/n
/n
950PM  Some visually distortions.  A breathing effect is very prominent right now.  Things seem to bulge and then return.  I am sitting next to R now, and I am talking with her.  Conversation seems very easy.  My thoughts are flowing perfectly, and I feel as though I can carry on a conversation forever.  This is until I hear M yell Matt, come check this out.  So I joined him on an adventure.
/n
/n
955PM  M discovered a mirror.  He was laughing at how his face was changing.  I simply laughed and told him how fun mirrors can be.  The others just laugh at us saying how fucked up we are.  To them we may seem fucked up, but I am thinking quite clearly right now.
/n
/n
1015PM  M and myself decide to try some nitrous oxide.  We each filled a balloon and inhaled it.  Instantly all the breathing was replaced with rainbow shimmers running through everything, creating a giant flowing wave of existence.  Everything before my each flowed with this new movement.  I just sat and smiled, as I was in awe and didnt know what else to do.  I knew people were staring, and I didnt care.  I was existing in the now, and now was all that existed.
/n
/n
1030PM  I have peaked at this point.  The visuals are not intense at all, but generally pleasant to look at.  I have a very nice body feel.  I close my eyes to see what lies behind them.  I was completely blown away.  I saw an image of an octagon.  All the corners of it were glistening silver orbs.  Then it seemed spokes ran off the orbs to a central point which was shimmering bright red.  This shape rotated for some time.  I was completely fascinated by it.  
/n
/n
1045PM  After awhile of watching the patterns behind my eyes, I begin to talk to R again.  M is off drawing I notice.  He said he was writing the secrets, but wouldnt tell me what they were.  Me and R begin to talk about things again.  After a few minutes we stop, and I begin to think.
/n
/n
I have recently made some big changes in my life.  I have made some decisions which hurt myself and others around me.  And I had been in doubt about whether or not these choices were for the best.  I had been tearing myself apart for awhile, unsure of what I wanted, and where I wanted to go with my life.  I thought hard about this.  I closed my eyes, and ignored the beautiful imagery.  
/n
/n
Without too much thought I realized my answers.  I had made choices that hurt me and others.  But the choices were the best for me.  I was doing what I should be doing.  I was where I NEEDED to be.  Everything was going exactly how it should be.  Hearing myself say this was perfect.
/n
/n
It was absolutely perfect.
/n
/n
I had never felt such a strong sense of inner peace as I did at that moment.  I achieved completely nirvana.  Everything was right with the world, and nothing could destroy that.  I just smiled and stared.  R asked me if I was okay.  I simply nodded my head and smiled.
/n
/n
The rest of night was nothing spectacular.  M drew some pictures that we looked at and I thought were brilliant.  He used math that I didnt think he could possibly understand, and he wrote poetry which moved me.  
/n
/n
I pretty much just sat and stared.  I was in my perfect world, and nothing could touch me.
/n
/n
12AM  I feel 100% sober.  I have a fantastic afterglow.
/n
/n
1AM  I have a nasty stomach ache.  Whether or not this is related Im not sure, but its something Ill look for next time I use DPT.  I fall into a deep sleep shortly after, and wake up feeling more refreshed than I have in awhile.
/n
/n
/n
I dont even know where to begin.  This time there was no fear and no shakes.  All the confusion and the terror was replaced with tranquility and understanding.  
/n
/n
The problems I had been facing were some of the most difficult I had ever faced.  This night DPT provided me with the answers I sorely needed.  It helped me to relax and accept all thats occurred around me.  2C-I has helped me to solve problems, but no psychedelic ever provided such a firm answer as the DPT did.
/n
/n
Of course, with this much variation between my last experience and this one, I still feel I do not know the true nature of this drug.  I will have to try it again by myself to see if things go different.  Perhaps now I have a better feel for DPT and could handle it.  Only time will tell.</bodytext></report>
