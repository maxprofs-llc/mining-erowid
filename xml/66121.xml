Hi, first I would like to tell you of all the drugs of done and some background. I'm a healthy, 180 pound 17 year old mexican living in Arizona. The only thing wrong with me is that I have ADHD which I think is total bullshit but I'm not complaining, I'm being fed amphetamines for breakfast. I've done cannabis (which I very much do not enjoy what-so-ever), amphetamine (only Adderall XR and Vyvanse), opiates and opioids (Tramadol, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Morphine, and Codeine. These are my favorite), Alcohol (another favorite), Lorazepam (good for when I get paranoid), inhalants (which were fun but not worth the damage it does to my organs and brain), Dextromethorphan (I get REALLY bad itch from it, even the welts), pseudoephedrine (might as well find a cook to turn it into meth but I myself would never touch that) and last but not least, Salvia Divanorum.

Well the setting and time was casual. My homie's house at around 3pm. We had recently purchased a gram of salvia 10x for about 20 dollars. We were skeptical and kinda mad because we thought we were ripped off but we said fuck it and tried it anyways.

3pm I take a huge rip of that whole .5 gram in the bowl. I held my breath for thirty seconds.

I was looking straight at my friend and all of a sudden my vision became scrambled and black kind of like when I get up too fast or get tunnel vision. All of a sudden I see a small, white speck and it goes from the size of a period to a huge gaping hole and my mind thinks 'Oh, I must be in a subway station'. Wow, after I thought that, I felt like my body was holding on to the top of the subway for my dear fucking life while it was going 100mph!
/n

After what seemed to be forever, I came to the end of the tunnel at full speed and I was blasted out like a cannon ball. After I finally came to the ground, I thought 'Holy shit I'm gonna fucking break every single bone in my body and die' but some mystical force turned me into a single seed.

I felt like my body was encased in some kind of soft, warm thing and I began to grow. I saw myself as a tree go from every stage from sappling to full a full blown giant tree. And I'm talking about the whole cycle of the tree, seasons and everything in the background. Winter, Spring, Fall and Summer. Feeling the changes in climate, it was just so beautiful seeing this tree in a meadow just live.
/n

But all of a sudden a man came and chopped me down, but my spirit felt no anger or sadness, I just felt like this man has to do what he has to do. After this I saw myself, the tree, get cut up into a huge 2x4 and shipped out.
/n
/n
Everything went black again... I saw myself just sitting staring into space from the perspective of the wall, I was the 2x4 used to build the house looking at my human self with my spirit. It was incredible.

After that, what seemed to be literally a lifetime, was only roughly 15 minutes of this mind boggling experience.
/n

After I sort of came to my senses, I had to 'Relearn' everything, I didn't know where I was, or who the hell was that man staring at me with complete astonishment. I kind of knew who I was but I've read an article from Sigmund Freud about the human ego and self identity and I guess I broke mine. I could only move my hands a certain way and my thoughts were just, what I would think to be, like a newborn being on this small planet Earth for the first time. After another 10-15 minutes, I finally had a good grip on my mind and my friend asked me how it was. I looked at him, and I began to cry and I told him it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
/n
/n
Now according to my friend after I exhaled, I closed me eyes and about 30 seconds later I began screaming 'Wooooaaahh!' like if I was on a rollercoster. Which I believe to be the subway part. After that, he said I started to lean forward and I fell on my face and I somehow picked myself up and my face expression was like if I was in complete awe. My mouth was open, my eyebrows were raised and my head was tilted up. Then he said I got up and fell on his bed and that I was tossing and turning and I had his bed sheets and blankets encased all over my body which I believe to be the part I felt that I was planted into the ground. I would occaisonally grimace or frown and I would just mumble random sounds. Also, I got up a few times but he gently sat me back down. He would ask me questions but he told me I was completely catatonic. He said after the 15 minutes I finally opened my eyes and he said I looked so fucking confused and I was moving my hands all wierd.

The after affects where subtle but pronounced. I felt a very warm sensation all over my body, my head hurt only a little bit, my mouth was really dry, my palms and torso were sweaty and I just had that feeling that everything is still 'different'.
/n
/n
All in all, this was the most spiritual experience I had with any drug. I didn't have any euphoria but what I got was something more than a 3 hour high. I got the gift of my Mexican Ancestors of having a more positive outlook on everything.

This happend yesterday but today my friend is going to try it too. He asked me if I would ever do it again and I just smiled and told him 'Never again'

May your life be filled with happiness.</bodytext></report>
