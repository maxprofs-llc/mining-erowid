I did MDMA (.5g over a period of 2 days) the last weekend of June 2010. Previously that year I had been taking SSRI's for depression and I was concerned that this would affect my overall 'high' (Which I'm sure it did). When I did plateau, it was medium strength, and short. And when I came down, I did not experience a crash followed by a hangover, in fact I had a sense of well-being and clarity after the effects of the drug wore off. (Although I think that I may have developed HPPD after this dosing.)

However, I most recently repeated the same dosing in mid-August (Less that 2 months later) and had an opposite experience, I tripped harder but had a severe come down that was followed by a depressive episode that lasted for at least 2 weeks. I've also had problems with my short-term memory (but these seem to be temporary)

I've done MDMA less than 10 times and I believe that I've reached the 'loss of magic' effect. It's nowhere near as good as it was the first time, and I've decided that I won't take it again recreationally because there's really no point, it does more harm than good.</bodytext></report>
