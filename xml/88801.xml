Background: Healthy. Tried many substances but never binged or used habitually. 
/n
/n
Set: Home with 1 friend.
/n
Setting: Eaten a small meal 1 hr prior. A stressful 4 weeks had gone by, and I had received some MDAI as a white crystalline powder. The week before a friend and I tried 5mg, then a few hours later 40mg to determine whether we thought it was actually MDAI and it's purity. We subtlety noticed 'something nice,' and concluded it was probably high quality.

Conclusion:
/n
I used MDMA 3 times, 4 years ago but for comparison It felt somewhat reminiscent.
/n
Unlike MDMA though, there is no 'blast off' like something starts and ends. 
/n
Mentally it feels mellow and very non-toxic, although a definite mood lift and desire to socialise.
/n
/n
Although it's somewhat sedating, I wasn't able to fall asleep easily. Thankfully a solid 8 hour sleep followed. The next day there was no real hangover. Maybe a little tired if anything.
