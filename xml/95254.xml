I used Ecstacy heavily during my twenties. I was diagnosed as bipolar and stopped using and started a ton of psychiatric meds. I had an opportunity to do pure MDMA a couple of weeks ago. I was very nervous about it interacting with my meds so I skipped them the morning of. I took one capsule and then took the other one a half hour later. Within an hour I was rolling. I sat in my living room listening to music for about five hours. It was so incredible. I was able to talk to my husband about some very heavy things that we haven't been able to talk about before. Everything was perfect. The next morning I woke up and felt fine except that the inside of my mouth was all chewed up.</bodytext></report>
