Saturday night. We all went to do mushrooms, I didnt get there in time cause they popped them at 420 so I decided to just go home. then I remembered my friend robin and giving me a few of his new pills he was taking about(robin has insomnia).So I take two thinking nothing of them, 30-45 minutes later I had a head rush and after that head rush I was in a state of relaxation much like a high from marijuana and it got deeper n nicer until I called rob and asked him about then he said it was prescribed to be only one a day and I did two but oh well. I then decided to walk to robins house. I had trouble keeping my balance as well as keeping awake but I wasnt truly sleepy at the time. I arrive at rob hi gives me two more and I go home. Feeling quite ready for bed now jus mellow I ate another half of one and railed another portion. Railing didnt do any thing Im jus really fuckin sleepy now this has been good I wish a had a doobie to smoke right now.</bodytext></report>
