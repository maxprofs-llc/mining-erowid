I saw this online as a 'legal marijuana' or 'herbal hydro buds.' This stuff is a joke.  I didn't get ANY high at all.  I noticed the only high I got was just from inhaling smoke and not oxygen.  There is no ingredient in wild lettuce that makes me 'high.' If I smoke about 5 or 6 grams I eventually get a buzz but no relaxation or pleasing body feelings like I get with marijuana.  It does not alter my mood or anything.  Usually if I smoke marijuana when I am depressed it instantly changes my mood.

I bought this thinking it would be a good natural sleep aid or something to help me relax.  It didn't do either of those.  Actually gave me a headache (which marijuana instantly takes away).  I don't think I will buy this stuff again.  It seems more like a good substitute for tobacco rather than marijuana.

Another reason why I was forced into buying this to test it out was because of the high price of marijuana here in Los Angeles.  I am looking at 20 dollars per gram.  I can get a half ounce of wild lettuce for 30 dollars.  Either way opium lettuce or wild lettuce is not worth the money.  I am better off taking sleeping pills or something if I can't get marijuana at a reasonable price.</bodytext></report>
