I take the above cocktail of medications for the treatment of Bipolar I disorder. The Topamax and Seroquel are night time drugs as they make me very sleepy, and the valium is for the agitation that comes from my manias. Seroquel tends to make me very hungry, which has led to weight gain (used to be 60 lbs lighter). I have no idea why anyone would take (other than the valium)  any of these drugs recreationally. For me, these drugs have brought me back from a very dark place, a place where I thought God wanted me to hurt people, where I had visual hallucinations, basically back from very severe mania. I can deal with the side effects. Other drugs I have tried that made me (at least) worse are risperdal and abilify.</bodytext></report>
