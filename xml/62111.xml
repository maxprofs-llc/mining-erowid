This report isn't really a warning to anybody, because as bad as it might sound, I really don't feel that it is. Its as much for the people reading it as it is for me to get things together and organized in my somewhat confused head.  I'm 16 years old right now.  I have been smoking pot just about every day for the past year an a half, maybe a little more.  I took my first drinks about two and a half years ago, but didnt get more than a buzz till about this time two years ago, over spring break of my 8th grade year.  I had just turned 14.  I remember I drank a few shots of whiskey and a few shots of cherry vodka.  Keep in mind that I was probably about 115 pounds and only 14 years old.  I had the most amazing time of my life, up to then of course.  I kissed a few girls that night, and had fun.

This started my pattern of every weekend drinking, then summer came, and I started drinking at least twice a week, but normally three to four times.  At the time a good drunk was 4-5 drinks.  I tended to drink with one kid most of the time, and occasionally a few others. Throughout that summer I felt the need to drink all the time in order to have fun.  That summer I also tried smoking grass for the first time.  My first time I smoked a shitty joint out of regular paper and didnt feel much.  The next time I tried it, about a month later, I smoked a gram of KB to myself rolled up into a joint.  I remember running to catch up with my friend and it all falling right on top of me. Laughter, light headedness, euphoria, music was rolling through my head that I had no control over. Rain was coming down unbelievably hard and everything was blurry.  All of the sudden the sun came out, I was soaking wet, really stoned for the first time, and had to walk probably about a mile to get to my friends and dry off.

It was only two months after that that I started smoking pot regularly with a kid who I would be spending most of my time with up until now, which is over a year and a half later. Im not the most popular kid in school, I cant say that I have to many real friends cause I get ditched by them a lot of the time. I stopped drinking for a while when I got into heavy weed smoking.  But that didnt last long. Five or six months later I drank a lot again.  I started experimenting with more drugs about 8 months after I became a regular smoker, and a year after I got drunk for the first time. I tried mushrooms.  I ate some of them, I dont really know how many, and me and my friend smoked bubblers most of the night.  I cant say it was a 'life changing experiance', but it was a start to my experimenting.

Over the summer of 2006 I tried more drugs. I moved into acid and tried some pills like vicodin and ritalin.  I took acid regularly for a few months, then stopped after realizing it got me down pretty bad.  Once I was crying for no real reason the day after I tripped, I didnt know what it was, but something was really bringing me down.  I had problems with depression in the past, but this was differant.  I stayed away from acid for a little while after that.  The fall of my sophmore year I tried a vast amount of pills.  And I fell in love with my next problem drug, Amphetamine.

The first time I took adderall I had no idea that it was a cousin to meth.  I thought meth was a drug only for hard core addicts.  Ampethamines are wonderful. They give me so much influance and euphoria.  I enjoy creative things like writing and drawing, and on amphetamines I could never stop coming up with new ideas.  I was so happy and the world seemed like there was nothing wrong with it. Once I blew a 30 mg and a big line form another pill, Im guessing it was about 35-40mg of the stuff.  I summed up my ideas about God and religion in a notebook, all in all it was about 5 pages long.

I also tired things like xanax, percocet, more vicoden, a lot of ritalin, and ambien.  There are probably a few more in there that I cant think of now.  That winter something new came along. Cocaine.  I never thought I would be blowing a line of cocaine. Ever. But I did. It became pretty big at my school and I thought why not try it.  I did it probably about 7-8 times in a period of a month, and I loved it.  I spent over a hundred bucks on it in only a short period of time, and got probably about a gram for free.  I didnt wanna get hooked though. I gave it a rest for a while.

In the past few months, to start 2007, I have started drinking more, and a lot of people are saying I am drinking pretty heavily.  I know I am, and I care about it, but I love drinking and I always have.  I care, but I dont care. I think about alcohol every day and have been smoking pot every chance I get since I got out of rehab. I was in an outpatient program for about 2-3 months because of my parents, I still smoked, I failed almost all my tests but refused to go back, and it worked somehow.  I have also been taking amphetamines and any uppers I can for the past few months once a week if not more.  I always think about them, and cant write without something to put me in the right state of mind.  Even now, I felt like I needed to sum all of this shit up earlier today, but I wanted to wait to drink more, and get to smoke too before I wrote it, on the basis that it would be a better story if I was high...right?  So as of now I am smoking heavier than ever, drinking more than ever, and always snorting or popping some kind of upper or downer.

This may sound like complaining about some sad slow process of slipping into addiction.  I dont know if thats what it is really. I know we are all going to die one day, and Im going to live while I have the chance to live.</bodytext></report>
