  I have always been a fan of perscription pills, specifically narcotic pain relivers.  So when a new neighbor gave me some of his oxycontin script I was thrilled.  Much publicity has arisen regarding this drug so I was determined to find out its real effects.  The setting was at my house.  My roommate was out of town which was perfect as I am wary of public settings unless I am familiar with the substance and can navigate.  I began with taking two of the 5 mg instant release capsules.  At about 30 mins. later I began feeling truly amazing feelings.  The drug gave me the familiar itchy feeling coupled with sweats and pupil constriction.  The side effects are mild and can easily be ignored.

I felt a huge desire to listen to music as i surrounded myself with pillows on the bed.  I was suprised by how tactile Oxy is.  It remindeds my of MDMA as indescribable pleasure waved through my body.  I wanted to touch and feel different textures.  I increased my dose by crushing some of the 80 mg tablet and swallowing it. I also experienced a peak like MDMA.  The feeling was almost orgasmic as the Oxy blinds all you pain receptors leaving only serotonin to flood my blood stream.  I did manage to go to a local party for a little while but avoided all alcohol consumption.

In conclusion,  Oxycontin is by far the strongest pharm. I have taken.  I took it over the course of the weekend and in that short time period I had to increase my dosage every time to get the same effect.  And my body began to crave it which is disturbing considering I don't have an addictive personality.  In all it was great to try but Oxy's addictive potential makes it ultimately undesirable.</bodytext></report>
