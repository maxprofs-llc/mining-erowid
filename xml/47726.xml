I have been a regular marijuana smoker for many years and the only time I ever failed a drug test was when I bought one of those cleansing drinks. The most effective method I've found is just coffee and a fist full of vitamins.

I work with juvenile delinquents and drug testing is mandatory for almost every job I've had. I refrain from smoking for a day or two( just to be cautious), drink a pot or 2 of coffee and eat some vitamins, and make sure I peeing every 15-20 minutes, and pee right before my test (I usually go right beside my car in the parking lot before I go in). It's always worked for me.</bodytext></report>
