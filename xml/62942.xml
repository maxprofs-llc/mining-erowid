It was November of 2005, and I had just begun my 6 month probation for possession of marijuana-under 2 ounces here in the great fascist state of Texas. I was looking for other, slightly more legal substances to lose my head with. Dex was getting old and Dramamine never really worked for me. But one day I was surfing the pages of totse.com and came across several reports of using just regular Benedryl to trip balls. 'Wow,' I thought. 'First cough medicine, now this?'

I had to work later that night, so I went to the grocery store and bought a bottle of the fuckers. I worked for Domino's, so the fact that I was a drug-user was less than exciting to these people. I popped about 30 pills on one of my deliveries and waited. It was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made, and I fortunately realize now that it could have been my last.

It was a Saturday night and I had to close. At about 10 pm the trip just washes over me. My skin turned red, like I was blushing. We had closed the front end and I was helping to clean it. As I was sweeping, I swear I heard Billy say, 'So what's going on down in ratchet-town?'

I turned to him and said, 'What?' probably a little louder than necessary. He looked up at me and said, 'I didn't say anything.'

I just sort of looked at him, trying to comprehend this. He just laughed and said, 'You're tripping.' He then gave me the eeriest cheshire cat smile.

Later that night it took me about an hour and a half to do a delivery that should have taken 15 minutes. I got yelled at several times and am suprised now they didn't send me home or fire me. I was useless that night. It was terrible trying to read addresses because when I tried to read anything the letters were all blurry.

We finally closed the store at about 2 am. I remember getting my money and sitting in my car. The next couple of hours or so is competely blank. When I came to, I was standing in some sort of junk yard, looking at what I thought was my car. The hood was torn off, then engine a mess, and my key didn't even fit. I knew it would be a lot of work. It was hopeless, no matter how much i tried, the car only got worse. I looked up and saw a couple of mexicans looking at me and shaking their heads. When I met their eyes, they walked off. I followed them to try and get them to help me, but they had disappearred. Tired, cold, and still too far gone to even know I was high, I got in the back seat and went to sleep.

When I woke up, I was horrified. I was in the back seat of some smelly ass car with no idea where I was. I got up and ent to look around. My fear became much deeper. I was on the south-side. The ghetto of Midland, Texas. My car was nowhere to be found. My keys, phone, money,...also gone. I walked all the way across town to my house in the safe haven of white-suburbia. My mom was so worried. She had already called the cops looking for me and my car. They called an hour later saying they had found my car, and that I was going to get a point on my liscense.

So, we went back for my car, and I realized just how lucky I was. I had parked my car half-way on the sidewalk with the windows down at 3am. It was only 3 blocks from where I had ended up. My money was miraculously still there, sitting all over the seat. But my keys and phone weren't.</bodytext></report>
