Preperation: Put 6 Percocets tablets and 1 Dimenhydrinate 50mg (to help with nausea) in a cup of warm water, let them dissolve fully then stirred the mixture

Note: administering Dimenhydrinate rectally burns a little but that feeling does go away after about 10 minutes.
/n
/n
The reason I did not take them orally is because I just had jaw surgery and I cannot swallow pills. I find administering rectally lasts much more longer then orally and seems to make the onset of the oxycodone to hit much faster.

Conclusion:
/n
This is by far my favourite drug of all time, If I had a constant sorce of getting perks I would be doseing as much as I could. Next time I dose I am going to go camping in the woods with my girlfriend.  Percocets make me very horny and loving, I'm sure it would be an awesome experince to spend with someone who I love that much.  I am also going to have to limit myself with this drug because as I said I could easily dose everyday and it would suck because my tolerance would sky rocket and I'd run out of pills very fast.

Have fun dosing
