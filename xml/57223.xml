I researched this drug, which I experience as at least as powerful as any antidepressant I've taken (and there have been many), on several medical sites.  All of those sites indicated to me that I should BEGIN with 5mg and ease up to 25- 50mg.

They did mention 'superdosing' at hundreds of mgs, but stated it was extremely dangerous.  I was not about to go there.

I have taken DHEA for about a year.  I took it once, felt great, but came off it to see if Metformin would work better (in terms of reducing body fat).  Immediately I crashed and burned by way of mood and energy.  About a week after being off it, I slept for 3 days straight, not having even started the Metformin.

I went back on a whole 25mg--to work upwards from there.  Again IMMEDIATELY I felt energetic, hyper, clear minded, like going out and doing things--almost hypomanic.  Also I HAVE been able to lose weight while on DHEA, and dieting/exercising like mad, when for years my weight had been 'stuck' no matter how little I ate.</bodytext></report>
