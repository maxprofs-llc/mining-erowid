I've recently received two different shipment of tramadol, each of a different type. The first was a white tablet, no name, no insignia, no label of any kind (other than tramadol HCl, 50mg)  - this made me a little uneasy. But I trusted the source completely, so I tried to settle my nerves. The second was a pink and dark blue/purple pill  - this one was called Domadol - also labeled 50mg tramadol HCl.

I worked my way up, as suggested, both to try to appreciate the substance better and to assure my own safety. 50mg, 100, 150, 200, 250, each on a separate day, separated by 3-4 days each time to try to stave off tolerance, alternating between the two types of pills.

I really noticed nothing until I hit a dose of 200mg, and even this dose was very mild - manifesting itself as a mild intoxication (very mild) that lasted 8 hours or so. I would liken the effects to a couple shots of liquor, mixed with maybe 1.5mg/kg DXM. When I upped the dosage to 250mg I noticed little more intoxication, but a marked increase in nausea. And I felt a definite increase in the DXM-like effects and a huge increase in nausea (to the point that I ALMOST lost my lunch). I didn't notice any iching, but did have difficulty staying with conversation or interacting with people.

I can't say that I really enjoyed the experiences, unfortunately, but I also was taking generics, and not Ultram. This might or might not have an effect, but I generally find generics to be inferior.

I can't stress enough how dangerous this compound can while driving, at high dosages. When I liken the effects to DXM, this isn't a direct comparison, but the frame-by-frame visual input at 150 mg and higher seemed to be clearly similar to a 1st plateau experience with DXM.</bodytext></report>
