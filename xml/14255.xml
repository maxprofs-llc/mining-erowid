We have been interested in alternate consciousness experiences for awhile, and it is with this in mind, that we decided to try 'the wormwood experiment'.

We took a small amount (a pinch, small fingers), and mixed it with cannabis.  We smoked it in a bong.  We felt immediately that we had stumbled into something very interesting and quite unlike anything we had previously experienced.

The result, for us, was a very relaxed body stone.  At the same time there was a sense of surging energy in our bodies.

I saw what appeared to be some kind of shimmering beings, about the room where we had smoked.  And something big. (scared the crap out of me for a second.)

My accomplice experienced an ache in the area of her 'third eye'.  She did not see anything out of the ordinary.

We would like to caution anyone reading this that attempting to move while having inbibed these substances is very difficult.  It took us 2 hours to get to the store (for munchies).  Although we tried repeatedly just to get off the couches.

Further experimentation is required.

We read 'the Thudge' article and are considering experimenting with this obviously more potent substance.  Our stones, were shorter lived and less pronounced, although many of the general descriptions sound similar.</bodytext></report>
