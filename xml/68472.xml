Its a real privilege to have family members that are prescribed to psychoactive drugs yet dont seem to take them that much. I recently nicked from my brother 4 20mg Temazepam pills and an ass load of .5 mg Clonazepams. These were the first drugs I had access to in quite a while, so I formulated a nice, relaxing trip of the two substances, using the Clon. as a catalyst for the Tem.

As I had a pretty full stomach at that point, I decided to grind up 1 mg Clon. and 40 mg Tem. and snort the mixture, as opposed to just ingesting it all orally. This was a pretty large amount of material to insufflate (for me, at least), so I took it in a bunch of little snorts. About 40% of the mixture dripped back down my throat with the aid of snorting some water. Never a pleasant experience, inhaling water, but it does a great job of clearing my nostrils of any flotsam and jetsam that had accumulated. Since a lot of the stuff was essentially swallowed in a thick gob of phlegm rather than snorted properly, it took longer than I had hoped for the effects to kick in. Given the shear amount of powder that I snorted, my nose is feeling comparatively okay. After 15 minutes, it feels quite fine, though a bit sensitive. I feel an odd synaesthetic connection between this sensation and mint flavored toothpaste.

I retire to my bedroom, with the lights turned out, and I gaze out my window to look at the weather. It is overcast, right around freezing, a few snow flurries lazily wandering through the air, and just enough fog to obscure the hillside opposite my neighborhood. There are drops of water coming off of the tree branches, so the snow must be slowly melting. Slush blankets the land. The atmosphere of my immediate surroundings combined with the atmosphere outside gives me a profound sensation of warm fuzziness, and I recognize that this weather is, for whatever reason, the most beautiful and comforting type of weather possible. It fits some kind of primal memory ingrained into my subconscious. Maybe this is the weather of whatever place I lived in in a past life, or maybe this was the weather of my ancient viking ancestors. Whatever the cause, looking out my window gives me a sense of perfect equilibrium between the deepest regions of my mind and my surroundings. I feel perfectly at peace.

Its still early afternoon, so as long as Im in my house, I leave all the lights out, choosing to sustain myself only with the light nature provides for us. That faint, shadowy light creeping in through the windows is comforting. All of the rooms of my house elicit a similar psychic response- they are connected to the memories of my early childhood. While staring into my bathroom, I lapse back to age six, and feel all of the wonder and awe of simple things that was emblematic of that time of life. The magic that young children find in everyday things comes rushing back, and I realize just how beautiful these things are. My house, my room, every bend in the roads of my neighborhood elicits a newfound awe. I see the simple magic of everyday things that I had too long forgotten since my mind was polluted with concerns of the adult world.

The effects are nice, but still not as strong as I had hoped, so I insufflate two more Clonazepams, totaling 1 more mg, and half a Temazepam, totaling 10 mg. Now the stuff goes down much easier. Soon, I also feel a glorious detachment from others. When a friend calls, I hang up immediately because I dont feel like talking to him. School, work, friends, all these things are miles away, and I am soaring high over them right now. Total detachment, My own little world, no one else may enter. Nothing worries me.

The other component of the experience is the physical effects I feel. As I had expected, Im getting a profound sense of relaxation, coupled with a dull fatigue that I fight back with a nice mug of Earl Grey. The effects of the Temazepam+Clonazepam are pretty similar to a really high dose of the latter- the notion that all bodily processes, including breathing itself, are essentially work, and to relax fully, as is the urge, I must let go of all movement of my body and just collapse to the floor, not to get up again. There are a few times that I honestly have to remind myself to breathe. When I exhale, I feel no reflexive urge to inhale again, and sink deeper and deeper. I could just sit there with my lungs emptying until I lose consciousness.

When standing, it is perfectly foreseeable to just cease all muscle control and yield my body to the forces of gravity, collapsing in a heap on the ground. I consider crawling into bed and just take a nap or chill out under the covers for a bit, but this seems like a worthless use of my time. I must crawl around my house, interact with my family to the best of my ability (which as it turns out, comes rather naturally, and I have no fear that my parents will notice that Im high), and experience the T and C daze in as many situations as possible. Although I feel tired, I have no desire to sit still, or maintain any train of thought for an appreciable time period. When I pick up a magazine, I cant follow the words, something else will distract me. As odd as it sounds, I am at once fatigued, relaxed, and positively antsy.

This dull sense of manic relaxation ebbs in about two hours, and I emerge feeling somewhat sore and tired, but my mood is definitely boosted. All in all, this was a fun little afternoon, and I plan on using these drugs in conjunction once again.</bodytext></report>
