I was given some 2C-T-2 pills by a friend who had been in the Netherlands. Being cautious with new materials, I decided to take 12 mg, and gave Gaichi somewhere around the same dose. I found this material unremarkable, and at times downright annoying. This may have been due to the fact that I took a light dose. The body load was pretty strong, I felt muscle tension and my eyes felt strained. It felt a lot like LSD, but not as juicy or fun. It was really cerebral; Gaichi and I talked about stuff in this really analytical way, but the meanderings felt unsatisfying and empty. I quickly felt like, OK where is this going, are we there yet?

The only interesting thing that happened was this: Gaichi and I spent a lot of the trip (about 3 hours) sitting in bed, talking. I was holding court -- he would get up and leave my room to fetch anything I needed from the kitchen. He left 2 or 3 times for about 5 minutes each time. During the time he left the room and I was alone -- right after he shut the door after him -- I was suddenly awash in really interesting ideas and clear thoughts, and I wanted to share them with him as soon as he returned. When he was in the room with me, I didnt feel the same degree of novelty in my thinking, but hooboy when he left; Boom! A carnival of neat thoughts. I thought that was strange.

I did not find it interesting enough to try again. I'll stick with 2C-B.</bodytext></report>
