It sucked. It was cool for about 4 minutes with hallucinations, then, it hit me. I puked for about an hour and went back to bed. My girlfriend had gotten me a trash can which really came in handy. Every two hours I woke up and pucked for about 20 minutes. It wasnt so bad the next day, it felt sort of like a really small hangover, or like when I'm coming down from weed, plus a headache.</bodytext></report>
