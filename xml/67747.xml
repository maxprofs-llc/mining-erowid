My boyfriend came home with some Bio-Freeze and raved about how it worked on his lower back. I took a look at the ingredients and found Ilex Paraguariensis. Thinking one would benefit more by drinking than rubbing it on I began my experimenting. I was taking asprin for pain in my feet and knees 3-4 times a day and could barely walk upon arising in the AM. I now take 3 heaping teaspoons steaped and strained in a pint of water daily. I have taken NO pain relievers for 3 monthes. Use caution the first 2-3 days as you will need the crapper often. Home day!</bodytext></report>
