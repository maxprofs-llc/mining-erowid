I have noticed (well, they're hard to miss) very unique experiences while on Ambien. I have even experimented with it, such as taking only 5mg or 50mg, and studying the effects on myself.
/n
/n
The following are the observations I wrote down while on 40mg of Ambien:
/n
/n
12:00am 
/n
Took 40mg Ambien.
/n
/n
12:30am 
/n
Disconnected feeling.
/n
Foggy thoughts.
/n
Hallucinations begin, very acidic [referring to LSD].
/n
Mind gains ability to make inanimate objects, animate.
/n
Interaction with these animates in very weird ways, including conversation with and without spoken words.
/n
Unlike lsd, very little control over the experience.
/n
Entrance into whole different created world.
/n
Barely able to communicate these thoughts with others in 'outside world'.
/n
Music has its way with thoughts, especially trance and darkstep [these are types of electronica for those who dont know].
/n
Music molds thoughts and mind into new 'Mental Worlds'.
/n
/n
1:30am
/n
Come back down into real world temporarily.
/n
sleepy, fatigued, but very awake.
/n
/n
2:00am
/n
wandering around in a concious trance-like state.
/n
/n
~2:00am - ~3:00am
/n
Memory Gap. [I recall realizing that I recalled nothing of that hour... sleep?]
/n
/n
3:00am
/n
decided to go to sleep.
/n

I have noticed an increasing tolerance to ambien, for now just to use it as a sleep aid alone, I must take 20mg (normal dosage is only 10mg).
/n
I suggest that if one decides to use Ambien recreationally (just something to get fucked up on) do not use it often. Tolerance builds up quicker than anything I have yet encountered, including ecstasy (MDMA) and LSD.</bodytext></report>
