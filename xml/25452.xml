I had taken Valum and Xanax every once and a while, usually when it was accessible.  For all those not aware, Xanax and the like are very easily obtainable in places like Latin America or South-East Asia.

During this particular experience, I was with in Thailand.  I went out for a night with my father in a beach-front town, riding motorbikes and drinking beer.  Once my pops was preoccupied for a moment, I took off over to a pharmacy and bought an 8 tablet-package of 1 mg. Alprazolam.

I took four, after having already consumed 3 12 oz beers.  I immediately picked up a 24 oz. beer for the ride.  Incidentally, this particular brand of beer, Chang, when purchased out there is anywhere between 7 and 14% alcohol by volume in a given bottle.  It's a gamble.  Alcohol definitely contributed to my experience.

I lost all memory after being on the motorbike for 20 minutes or so, but the onset was like any Xanax or Valum:  My head felt light, as did all my movements.  No deep pleasurable body highs like opiates.

I woke the next morning in my hotel room, naked from the waste down, a cigarette had burned into the bedding.  The room was a complete waste-the small fridge was open and various beverages and food items opened and scattered about.  It was clear that I had stumbled all over the room and was hungry before finally passing out.  As for my exposed bottom-half, there was no girl next to me when I woke so I would assume I came to my room alone.

My dad rattled on the door a few minutes later telling me to get my shit together so we could get breakfast.  I had told him I must of had a bit too much to drink, because I didn't remember a thing.  He was shocked at the state of the room when I let him in, and he explained, laughing, that I had ordered a whole feast's worth of room service to his room for him and the girl he was with.

That's not the first time myself or friends of mine have blacked out from the combination of Xanax and alcohol.  I have explicit footage of people doing and saying outrageous things while under the influence; showing them later drew forth no recollection.

I guess my recommendation is first of all not to take as many as 4 while drinking- I can honestly say that the effects of 2 seem the same as 4 without drinking, so one wouldn't be missing much.  Also, it's probably best not to drink heavily on them.</bodytext></report>
