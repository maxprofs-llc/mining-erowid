Tastes really bad, the flavor will dominate anything you mix it with. If you can get past the awful taste it may or may not have an AD effect. Not worth trying.

Method 1: A.j. flowers in tea. Bleh. No noticeable effects regardless of variations of dosage (large vs small vs repeated doses, etc).
/n
/n
Method 2: Ethanolic extract. Tastes even worse. Same poor results as method 1.

Summary: not recommended. Save your money and time and find a much better &amp; more efficient solution if you have depression or whatever problem you think A.j. will help.

All trials were performed with A.j. alone with no other substances to adulterate the experience.</bodytext></report>
