I won't spend much time discoursing on set and setting or anything since this wasn't a terribly psychadelic experience.

To begin, let me just say that I was quite fascinated by the PIHKAL entry for this chemical and the idea of 'smart drug', focus aid, chemical insight enhancement, or whatever you want to call it.

I took around 10mg at approximately 12 oclock at night.  I had intended to hit the books and ascertain what, if anything, this drug might have to offer with respect to totally utilitarian (ie non-recreational/spiritual) consciousness altering properties.

It came on much faster than I have previously noticed a phenalthylamine to, and I felt undeniably speedy in 20 or 30 minutes.  This stimulation was roughly similar to the mental aspects of something like caffeine or adderall, but physically seemed much more gentle.

You see I say gentle because, at one point, I was using caffeine fairly regularly to alleviate the irritation of waking up in the morning.  Randomly, I would get small amounts of blood in my nose and ears when I showered, presumably because the heat of the water brought the blood vessels closer to the surface of my skin and the increased blood pressure/heart rate burst small capillaries close to the surface.  Not a big deal, but somewhat disconcerting.  Also, lots of caffeine always makes my stomach pretty uncomfortable, and my muscles sore.

This contrasts quite a bit with 2C-D, since the body buzz resulting from it was actually somewhat pleasant.
/n

I'd say it peaked around 2.5 hours after ingestion.  The peak was actually slightly psychadelic:  there were subtle breathing effects and some other mild visual distortion.

As for the studying, well.. I can't say it went well.  My natural tendancy towards ADD was probably stronger if anything.  However, I don't exactly feel right about calling Shulgin and company wrong either.  The thing is, I don't doubt that this could be described as 'insight enhancing' given other circumstances.  Had I been reading something (for english say, or a philosophy class) or an architect or artist working on studio homework, I actually think it might have gone great.  
/n
/n
The kind of insight enhancement provided by this drug is not suitable for work that is ultimately methodical.  I say that because I was doing math and computer science homework, and I didn't put even put a dent in the number theory OR the code.

Additionally, although I certainly wouldn't reccomend it until you've found a dosage appropriate for you, I imagine this would be very effective for long monotonous tasks such as driving.</bodytext></report>
