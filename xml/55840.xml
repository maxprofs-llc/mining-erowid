Well we took 2C-C earlier that day at Bonnaroo 2005 and had already came off it and Brad happened to have 6 doses of what we called the Blue Smurf. The 4HO-MiPt was in powdered form in a capsule with marking crystals in it to tell it apart from the other research chems we had.  We had 2CC, 2CE, 4HO-MiPt, shit load of molly.  Anyways, we dosed for Widespread Panic. Now for the trip:::::

It came on like MDMA but not so strong.  Like a nice high. It took a good hour for it to kick in. When we started walking around it kicked in REALLY hard.  We all laughed histerically at nothing.  Cris and I were dressed river wading pants in the rain and it felt like we were above everybody because we could walk were no man had gone before with the waders.

Visuals were like prism like long streams of light rushing thru the sky.  Lights were magnificent.  I'll tell you, IT WAS SOME HALLUCINOGENIC SHIT!  Every now and then it would look like there was a shockwave that would fly out from my body thru the ground.  It had us feeling really goofy in the head.  There would definately be no way to hide it if I wanted to.

Duration was about 8 hours in all for us.  No cracked out come down.  Awesome.  Very smooth Cris says.  However Cris and I (Brad) both are sure we still see shit when we are power stoned on nice nuggets.  Or when we rip a nitrous ballon to the face.</bodytext></report>
