This website talks about drugs and also states of mind, caused by either chemicals entering the brain and doing their thing or by natural things such as meditation. Well I am bipolar, which was called 'manic-depressive disorder' which means I have manic episodes and depressive episodes. Mania, to me, can be described as the ultimate 'natural high'. Less stronger than cocaine, much more stronger than caffeine. I will attempt to explaine my mental state, emotions, thoughts, actions, etc. etc. so you can dive into my gift and curse of bipolar.

+Mania+

Onset-
/n
Probably the best part of mania. What I normally begin to feel is
/n
/n
Mood Lift
/n
Excessive Self Esteem
/n
Energy
/n
Creative Thought
/n
Spending Sprees
/n
and even a decent degree of Euphoria.
/n
/n
I become talkative, cocky, erotic, I tend to smile alot, I can sleep for 3 hours and feel completely rested, basically I feel supreme.
/n

Day 2
/n
After a night time sleep at 3am, waking up at 6am and feeling like a morning bird, going outside to see the beautiful Arizona sunrise during spring brings even more moodlift. I become task oriented, thinking of nothing but achieving my goal, I even help my dad changing the tires which he had to take a break and I continued on uninterupted. Visual flow of artistic ideation is swirling in my head, I usually draw a scale with all my manic feelings on the right side, weighing down the right side of the scale. To me that represents my skewed emotional balance.

Day 3
/n
I don't get any sleep, I go on shopping sprees, buying hats, shirts, pants, candy, games, flowers, markers... Buying something always makes me feel good during mania.
/n
/n
Day 4
/n
Usually everything becomes less fun, I become irritable, inattentive, like if I have adhd. This is when mania takes its toll
/n
/n
Day 5
/n
I'm coming down, this is when I usually start feeling tired and depressed. My depression can be more accuratetly desribed as apathetic. Basically I just start not giving a fuck. This is usually the end of the manic ride and I go into the depressed state.

/n
-Depression-
/n
Onset
/n
After becoming exhausted I begin to feel sort of neutral to apathy. I basically have somnolence throughout the day. I feel
/n
/n
Fatigue
/n
Apathy
/n
Forgetfullness
/n
Irritable
/n
Gloomy
/n
Everything seems darker..
/n
/n
Day 2
/n
Apathy then transforms into guilt and worthlessness. Suicidal ideation begins to creep into my thoughts. In this point in stage I think 'what would happen If I shoot myself' but I rarely attempt suicides on Day 2, if ever.
/n
/n
Day 3-Day 6
/n
Depression always lasts longer in bipolar, I feel like shit, tired, basic feelings of depression
/n
/n
Day 7 and plus
/n
I never know how long this state will last but it usually lasts for 2 weeks where I just have suicidal ideation and such.
/n
/n
-Neutral+
/n
/n
Onset
/n
Depression slowly fades away into what I perceive as 'normal'. I can never fully understand what 'normal' is but I know just what it feels like, or what I would think it is.
/n
/n
I decided to share this because bipolar, to me, is both a gift and a curse that about 3% of the american population is affected by. This place is meant for Mind and Body, drugs or not, but anyways I hope this gives you an understanding to the simple but complex mind of the human being.
