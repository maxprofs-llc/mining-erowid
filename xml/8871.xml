just recently, my friend had told me that she had some synthetic opium, as she described it.  i've smoked opium several times before and was interested to try this to see how is compares.

the substance she produced was little red crystals which she added to a bowl of really good pot.  when i smoked it, the first thing i noticed was the smooth, flowery taste.  the second thing i noticed was that, while i was definetly high, i was alot more clear headed than when i normally smoke pot alone.  there were no alterations of my perception of time, or anything else.

all of this was different from my experiences with opium.  the opium i have always smoked has been brown, and always with a harsh taste.  when i have smoked opium with pot, it was never good pot, and the pot i smoke the red rock with was medicinal pot from one of california's cannabis clubs.  and most importantly of all, when i smoke opium, there is always an alteration of my perceptions, from mild hallucinations to a total loss of my sense of time.

when i got home, i checked erowid for more info about red rock, and had found what i had suspected all along, that it really isn't opium or anything like it.  my suggestion is to not watse your time with it, because chances are it is just dragon's blood incense.</bodytext></report>
