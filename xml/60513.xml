I love drugs.  Way more than I should.  I'm 19 years old, I have no job, I'm a college dropout, and every single day I wake up to the same painful, itchy motivation.

Then again, I suppose everyone has their hobbies.  Some work on their cars, some follow sports, I like to see things and feel good.

I don't condone intra-veinous drug use.  I believe that after the first real IV hit of a drug, one can begin to develop an affection for the needle.  After I injected OxyContin for the first time, I began dabbling with injecting every drug I could (with proper research beforehand, of course).  Pushing chemicals directly into my bloodstream is completely different than any other method of drug administration.  What makes it that way is simple:  the head rush.  A head rush is a damn hard thing to ignore, and once I experienced it, it was very, very hard to forget.  It lingers in the back of my head, even while I may be happily sedated on other drugs, I know that I've found the best of the best, and I feel like I'm wasting my time and money on anything else.  And thats how the slippery slope starts.

On to my first IV experience....
/n
/n
My friend and ex-heroin addict, A., picked up two OC's from Rochester, not far from my CNY town.  I had expressed interest in shooting up to him previously, and he ran me through the basics.  I agreed to shooting with him, as he had recently procured a clean 10-pack of 100-unit insulin single-use needles.

He warned me that a whole 80mg dose of OxyContin could be dangerous to some first time shooters, so I told him about a time 6 months earlier when I had insuffulated 60mg of OC and drank a fifth of rum, and the worst that happened was vomiting.  Besides, I was gung-ho about it at the time.  I wanted my first hit to be memorable, I had no fucking idea.

He broke my 80mg tablet of Oxy into 4 similar pieces and placed them into a spoon.  He then pulled 85 units of clean water into my syringe, and squirted it onto the pill.  Next, he cooked the pill with a Bic until there was some bubbling and a faint trace of steam above the mix.  In one motion, he crushed the cooked pill with the back of the plunger, and it squished down into the mix.  Last, he placed a tic-tac sized cotton piece in the spoon, and drew up roughly 70 units of liquid oxycodone into the syringe.

I tied my right arm off with my belt, pulled it tight with my teeth, and let him spot the vein.  He inserted the needle head, pulled back blood to indicate a clean vein hit, and pushed the plunger down as I let loose the tie.

INSTANTLY, I felt my first real head rush, and let me tell you, it was insane.  All at once, the tension in my body released, and I fell back onto a pillow, and stared at the ceiling, enjoying the incredible wave of warmth that surrounded my being.  It was as if God himself reached through the clouds and granted me total bliss, without any responsibilities or worries.  The world was suddenly right, and all of the suffering of humans no longer mattered.  I distinctly remember it as the most euphoric moment of my life.

The Initial head rush stayed with me for about a half hour, followed by the easiest, most settling opiate high I have ever known.  Small things like smoking a cigarette, or taking a sip of hot coffee would intensify the euphoria.  Even vomiting (which I did on 3 occasions that night) brought the head rush feeling back for a little while.  I was laughing hysterically the whole time I was throwing up.  While music was enjoyable, I remember not really caring about my surroundings.  I could shoot OC and heroin in a completely dark and empty room and still have a blast.

That is actually the testament to the true power of shooting up drugs like OxyCodone and Heroin, the pleasure from the high is so intense that addicts are able to accept the fact that their lives are shit, that they may lose everything in the end, and not care.  They accept their lives no matter how ridiculous the circumstance, and just keep pushing and pushing to stash more, because the high is literally that good.

That was my first experience with shooting up, in October of 2006.  
/n

Since then, I have put Cocaine, Morphine, MDMA, Methamphetamine, and Heroin into my arm.  I have even shot whiskey and sometimes warm water just for the act of using the needle.

I spent my student loans and scholarships real quick.  Then I dropped out.  Then I sold everything.  First to go was the iPod my dad bought me for Christmas.  Then my Xbox, games, movies, and even my baseball card collection.  Then I started stealing.  I'm still stealing.  My arms are sore and they look like shit.  I'm in the kind of weird junkie phase right now that would prompt me to write this, and think the last 5 months over.

Well, I guess there's always Methadone....</bodytext></report>
