I have finnally dicovered an easily accesable combination of supplements that will actually cause a noticeable and pleasant effect.Im sure theres a whole lot of other herbs,pills,supplements etc.,that could be included in the combination but Im just reporting the ones that I have used with satisfactory results.

Ive used 5-HTP(tryptophan)for the past month,taking it during the days an anti-depressant, and have been very satified with the results.It works well as a mood elevator during the day and sleep inducer/sedative during the evening especially when taken along with herbal supplements.The combination Ive been taking almost every evening for the past month is:4-6 250mg.5-HTP gel caps(niacin,vitamin B-6,and  magnesium are the other  active ingredients in this particular brand of 5-HTP wich are crucial for maximum effects),4 valerian root/passion flower/kava kava gel caps(usually somewhere around 2000 mg.a piece, and 4-6 kava kava root gel caps(mg.=around the same as valerian).

Im not sure on the exact amount of mgs.of each supplement but for the kava kava,valerian,and passionflower just take at least 2-4 over the recommended dosage. I once took a whole bottle of kava kava extract wich resulted in a strong intoxication with no undesirable effects,though I ate a single tbls. of nutmeg several hours before wich could have contributed and/or been responsible for that.

I usually sleep uncomfortably and wake up several times during the night ,but when taking this combo I sleep like a baby.</bodytext></report>
