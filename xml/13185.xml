Last Friday I found these pills I hadn't had in a while and since I was bored I decided to try some.  I was talking on the phone with a friend because it sucks to be high and alone, but I didn't want to take it out with my friends and it not do anything.  I popped 3 or so 20mg in my mouth and after a while I started getting a cool high.  A general euphoria with about 1/2second delay in sight and slight dizziness.  Well I considered side effects good at the time since nothing bad had happened so of course I decided to pop some more.  I got extremely tired after about an hour or two but decided to stay up late.

About two hours later I decided to go to sleep, but the sleepiness had worn off and I didn't fall asleep for a lot longer and had slight nausea.  After that I remember waking up Sunday and wondering what had happened.  I didn't fall in a coma because friends told me they saw me awake and actually talked to me.  So now I have lost 24 hours of memory because of those pills.</bodytext></report>
