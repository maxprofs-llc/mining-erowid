My First Experience:

Very casually one night I decided that I wanted to try meth. A friend of mine had got some so I decided to act on my curiosity.

I bought a $20 bag, which seemed pretty insignificant to me at the time. It was issued with a warning about watching my intake as meth is very potent.

I prepared two lines around 11:00 pm and snorted one. I immediately jumped up and had newfound energy. My energy sent me to snort the other line. I had an intense desire to chill out. I sat down and noticed myself bouncing visually from one object to another. Music sounded pure like fresh spring water (much like ecstasy). For the next four hours I got into the intense speedy feeling by dancing, partying and then cleaning like I never have before. Around three in the morning I decided it would be good to take a bump. Now, realize, its 3:00 in the morning and I want to do more speed so I dont sleep. It seemed so perfectly logical at the time. By the end of the night I had taken four or five lines of meth. Needless to say, I didnt get to sleep that night. In fact, I didnt sleep the next night either. I was still speeding along, no chance of sleep in sight. By day three I have terrible raccoon eyes and I feel my body wanting to sleep and slow downunfortunately the meth is keeping me up and going. At this point I feel the drug is stronger than my body is. A third night goes by and I even close my eyes praying for sleep but it doesnt come. Four days after I took my last line I fell asleep for a long, long nap.

Words of Wisdom:

There is no trying meth. You are either zooming for a day + or your sober. This is not a recreational drug. Its a hard-core drug that surpasses cocaine in intensity. Its a hell of a lot of fun. I had so much fun when I was on meth that I kept wanting to do more. Whats the harm I thought? I feel like Im moving so fast and sometimes just cant stop grinning or laughing. When my meth was gone and I threw the bag away I learned something valuable. First I went through the trash can to find the bad HOPING that there was just a little more. Im not an addict but I sure wasnt in the drivers seat at that point. Its good to feel nice but its also good to feel tired or a little down in the dumps every once and awhile. Permanently zooming at 180 beats per minute will leave me dead way too early in life. After I decided that I needed to step back from this very addicting drug I was much better off. I still think about getting some meth now and then. Every once and a while I still crave it and think about speeding. Im not going to tell you not to try meth but do heed all the caution signs that people put out there.
