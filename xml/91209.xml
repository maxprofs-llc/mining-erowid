Started out with small lines about 8 pm. It had a similar effect to coke but way more haunting. Noticed that my balance was off and I started losing focus. Into fifth hour I started to enjoy the powerful high. At 5 am finished last line and began to crave more. The drug made me extremely paranoid, off balance, drool and the crash was horrible. I had to concentrate hard just to speak. I craved the drug so much the next day, I drove to get more knowing I barely could control my car. /n

Day two was a better experience but this time my crash ended with trouble breathing, my heart beating out of my chest, and pains I'm my muscles. When I used the bathroom my urine was dark. I began to panic as I felt as if I was slipping away. At this point I had a family friend drive me to the emergency room. This drug landed me a three day hospital stay with kidney and liver damage. I do not recommend bath salts.
