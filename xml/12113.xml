I'm a 15 year old kid and I've been smoking weed since last spring (about 9 months).  Since the beginning of this school year I've been getting high every day, and in the last month or so it's been 2-3 times a day (it's late January now).  I would smoke with my friends during school, after school, at home when my parents weren't around, pretty much anywhere I could.

I've always had a tendency towards psychological addictions and I'd say that I love weed so much that I am pretty strongly *psychologically* dependant on it.  Anyway, 3 days ago a friend of mine dared me to quit so I did.

My first day of abstinence, I had an incredibly hard time getting to sleep and ended up getting to sleep at 5 am after lying in bed awake for 3 hours.  I also slept very lightly that night after I did get to sleep.

The next day I woke up with a pretty bad sick to my stomach feeling and I really didn't want to eat hardly anything that day.  The nausea lasted all day as well, and I had a mild headache.  The next night the same thing happened.  The night after that I decided to eat 4 extra strength Vicodin I found laying around to help me get to sleep (lol).

That brings me to this morning when I again woke up with nausea and I still don't want to eat anything.

It seems impossible that all of this could be happening out of coincidence (I not getting sick or anything).  Even though I have always heard that pot isn't physically addictive and therefore doesn't cause withdrawal symptoms after quitting, that is obviously the only logical answer to why this is happening to me.
