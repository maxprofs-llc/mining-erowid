Slight correction: Somehow the dose was somewhere between 40-50mg (OUCH), not 16mg like I carefully weighed.  (Long story!)

The circumstances surrounding this experiment might have played a significant role in the toxicity and terrible trip.  But I also feel it is my duty to report this negative 2C-I trip, given its intensity and harm done to my body.

/n
Previous drug use that might have affected the experience: MDMA (100mg), 1 week prior.

4:00pm - 3mg 5-MeO-DiPT (barely threshold dose), 3mg 2C-I, both sampled while weighing out doses.

4:30pm - started to feel the effects of the foxy, with a somewhat more difficult feeling of tension than foxy alone.  Tested my blood pressure and pulse at the local grocery store, and both blood pressure and pulse were significantly higher (96/164, 78bpm)
/n
/n
5:00pm - felt fine, like most effects had left my body of the small threshold doses.  The feeling of tension is gone, and I feel prepared for a come-up that may be difficult.
/n
/n
6:30pm - ingested ~13mg  2C-I in a gellcap.
/n
/n
7:00pm - My girlfriend unexpectedly stops by.  I am very grateful, because at this point I am starting to feel very speedy and tense, and a profound sadness and uneasiness.  Could this be lowered seratonin levels due to MDMA use a week ago?
/n
/n
7:30pm - Things are getting worse.  I thought I would have come up by now.  My legs are shaking, and my hands are freezing cold.  I am shivering, but my head is burning up.  I cannot find comfort, and watching a movie is overwhelming, and just trying to lay in bed feels uncomfortable.
/n
/n
8:00pm - Time is going by so slowly.  This is 10x worse than the come-up of a previous high-dose mushroom experience.  My girlfriend later reports that at that time, it looked like I could be a 50-year-old cancer patient on my death-bed.  (I'm glad she didn't share this with me at the time!)  My skin was cold, gray, sunken, and I was shivering and in a lot of pain.  I tried everything I knew to escape it - to go inward, meditate, or go outward and think about something else.  Nothing worked.  My body held me right there, experiencing the center of the pain, and each moment seemed like an eternity.  My stomach felt upset from tension, and I felt slightly disconnected from my body, even though it was sending me intense signals of pain and discomfort.
/n
/n
8:15pm - Time is still crawling along.  I am trying to get comfortable, laying on the floor, drinking OJ, but I just cannot.  I get up and type a poem on the computer.  I am feeling like 'autumn' - the feeling right before the death of winter.  I can type, but my fingers are shaking.  This helps slightly to take my mind off my shaking legs, my uncomfortable heart, and my cold, tense body.
/n
/n
8:30pm - Shouldn't I have come up by now?  No visuals, minus some breathing of objects.  I am totally with-it mentally, except for a few strange trippy thoughts, but unfortunately I am with-it enough to feel quite sad and feel like I am going to die, STILL.  It is T+2 hours, and I can't understand why I am still experiencing the symptoms of 'coming up', times 100.
/n
/n
9:15pm - The last 45 minutes were agony.  But suddenly at 9:15pm I realized I would live.  My girlfriend reported that I looked a lot better, and fixed me a really nasty tasting drink with salt and sugar in it - I was peeing every 15 minutes since ingestion of the 2C-I, and I felt quite dehydrated.  My girlfriend reported that I looked about 35 years old instead of 50 now.  (I am in my mid-20's).
/n
/n
9:45pm - I feel my body slowly relaxing, occasionally still wracked by tremors.  The feeling of complete uncomfortability is still very present, and the visuals are a tiny bit more pronounced.  No color shifts though, even with super-dialated eyes.  Just some breathing and rearrangements of textures.  At this point, I just want the experience to be over.  I can feel that my body is going to PAY the next day - my legs are stiff and sore (I can barely feel them again), and my heart slightly hurts, my stomach is uneasy, my neck is extremely tense, and my jaw is slightly tense.  Strangely-enough, I feel very mentally with-it, just a bit 'slow'.
/n
/n
10:00pm - I lay on the ground with my girlfriend, just talking.  This has been the singlemost difficult experience with any substance I have ever had.  I wasn't expecting this at such a low-end dose.  The thoughts that went through my mind were - 'could it have been the 3mg foxy I ingested nearly SIX hours ago?' - 'was one week not enough to wait... but the body effects would have been just as bad, right?'
/n
/n
10:30pm - My girlfriend goes to bed.  She is so sweet to stay over and take care of me during this dark period.  It seems like it has been days since I ingested the 2C-I, and I feel like my body has just survived torture.  I promise myself to do much Yoga tomorrow and to go work-out at the gym, if my body is up for it.
/n
/n
12:00am - Still awake, laying in bed, thinking.  What a rough experience.  There was, however, a strong power of 'change' behind it.  I try to use the energy to start a change in my life to eat more healthy in the future.
/n
/n
1:00am - Still going to the bathroom every 15 minutes, but now I can eat some blueberry waffles and drink more than a few sips of OJ.  My pupils are almost completely back to normal size.  I am still tripping out slightly, and my thoughts when I try to drift off are frightening and random.
/n
/n
1:30am - An extremely wonderful, intense love-making session from out of the blue.  My body suddenly felt so good to have made it through the situation, and the sexual energy and desire to reproduce could almost be described as 'forcefully powerful' within me.
/n
/n
2:30am - Lovemaking stops and she drifts off again into sleep.  I manage to drift off to sleep for an hour, then wake up, then drift off again.
/n
/n
5:00am - Finally able to get into restful, continuous sleep.
/n
/n
It's the next day - I slept until 3pm, and besides the strong urge to throw out the remaining 2C-I, I feel fairly normal.  My mind is doing surprisingly well, but my body is sore all over.  My legs are stiff, my eyes hurt, my neck is tense, my lower back is a mess, and my body feels so physically tired.
/n
/n
Looks like phenethylamines aren't for me... I am so hesitant to try this again - even though I know the HUGE body load and pain could be due to the Foxy (small threshold dose) and/or taking MDMA a week earlier.  (But this would just affect euphoria, not the actual physical effects, right?)

I was so hopeful with 2C-I after reading all the positive reports...</bodytext></report>
