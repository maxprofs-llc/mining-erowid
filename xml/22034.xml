I was previously diagnosed with a serious mood disorder and medicated accordingly.  These medications were not right at all.  One depressed night I decided I would try to end my life again.  So I looked at the bottles of pills on my dresser and grabbed a huge glass of water.  I swallowed 25 Risperdol pills along with 20 Paxils and 20 Depakote pills.  I proceeded to lay down and try to go to sleep one last time.  I fell asleep and was woken up the next morning by my mom.  Obviously, there wasn't any success.  But I felt very groggy.

I went up to take a shower and when I got out and went back down to my room I saw my mom packing up clothes and she said there was an ambulance on the way.  I got strapped down to the bed in the ambulance and taken to the emergency room.  They pumped my stomach which was useless since everything was already digested.  I became incontinent on the bed and was fading in and out of consciousness.

They gave me a stomach full of charcoal and sent me to the psyche ward at(my new home at that time of my life).  I slept for nearly a week only waKing up once or twice a day for meals.  Day by day I was feeling a little less sedated.  I ended up being there for 9 days.  They released me with no prescriptions, their reasoning being my system needed to clear out.</bodytext></report>
