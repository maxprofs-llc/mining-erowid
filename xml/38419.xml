I was taking venlafaxine daily for a year and a half. I moved to a tiny island in the Aegean sea and could not purchase any more, so abruptly stopped taking them. 24 hours after my final dose, my heart felt as if it was skipping beats. I'm 26 years old and I thought I was having a coronary. When trying to fall asleep, layed in bed in a dark room with my eyes closed, the skips felt like small shocks - I had white flashes in my eyes and it truly felt like having a short electric shock put through my body.

Right now I haven't taken any for a week, and these symptoms are starting to dissapear. The heart skipping is less intense and less often. My blood pressure is much higher - the weakness I permanently felt whilst taking venlafaxine has been replaced with bulging veins and a bad temper. A daily chore is to chop logs for firewood, and while dosed this tired me out quickly, but now after a week I have more energy than I know what to do with.</bodytext></report>
