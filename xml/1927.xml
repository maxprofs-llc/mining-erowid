Well, I took around 3.5mL of butanediol, then decided I wasn't wasted enough. I asked my brother to measure me off some more, and he dosed me out another 5.5 mL. I passed out in a chair with my head tilted back and began vomiting. And choking. My dad found me and rushed me to the ER. I had a catheder installed and a tube down my throat. Ow. It hurt to pee for like a week after that. Well, I woke up to find a $6000 bill, and to feel sick for a few days after that. It sucked bad. My bro felt bad because he didn't know what to dose at.</bodytext></report>
