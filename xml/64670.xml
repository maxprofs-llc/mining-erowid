Smoked 1 bowl full of material in a water pipe. About 5 hits total. Smoked only the flesh scraped from red skin.

Felt effects almost immediately.  Very similar to marijuana.  At first more focused, but as I type this 30 minutes later I'm a little dizzier and losing ability to focus.

Sounds are enhanced.  Eyes are watering more than usual.  Getting a little jumpy.

Overall, nice effect, seems to be a nice substitute for marijuana.  Will definitely try again, probably blending with marijuana next time.</bodytext></report>
