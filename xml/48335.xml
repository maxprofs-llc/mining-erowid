After reading on the 'net' about wild letuce I got me 50 grams for 9 euro at my local smartshop. After a some beers and weed joints I decided to test it. I rolled a small weed joint (normal rizla blue) with .25 gram lactuca added. It got me a bit less emotional. A nerve pain in my neck started to dissolve within 25 seconds after the first drag! It was gone after the joint. Nice results.

I repeated the same after an hour, but this time in bed. I got a feeling of wanting to lay down and close my eyes, but I resisted until I finnished the joint. Laying down and closing my eyes I 'melted' straight in to a dream. I awoke 6-7 hrs later fully rested after some wild dreams.
