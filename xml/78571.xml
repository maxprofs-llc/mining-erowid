I picked up some Paganum Harmala at the local international market and planned taking it with my next shroom experience. One night I came home moderately drunk and decided to smoke about a teaspoon of ground Harmala seeds with out follow the fasting regulations for MAO's. After about 5-10 minutes I started to spin and passed out. I woke up the next day with and extreme headache and I felt very nauseous.

Now it has been nearly two months since the experience and I am still experiencing headaches. It probably doesn't help that I am extremely stressed out with school, but I am pretty sure this experience has cause me to have on and off headaches every day for almost two months. I am a little scared, but I can not conclude my diagnosis until the school year is over, and my stress levels subside. I was considering taking a mild dose of LSD. I have read all about the magic it has worked with migraine sufferers.</bodytext></report>
