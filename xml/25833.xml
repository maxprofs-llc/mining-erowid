I will never ever take ambien again. Since highschool I have had a problem with depression and one of the problems I was having was that I could not get to sleep easily, or it would be hard to stay asleep as well. I took my nightly handful of pills (effexor, zyprexa) and my ambien and I sat down to start playing some video games before I got tired. My memory of that night ends here, the next memory I have is of me in the ICU at steven's hospital. Apparently, sometime after I had taken the 10mg of ambien that I was supposed to, I downed the rest of the bottle and took an entire bottle of my zyprexa, huffed a bug bomb, and was bleeding profusely out of my mouth and nose. This is just what other people have told me about what happened that night, I have no memory of it at all.

So if you are going to take ambien, be very careful, I don't even know what triggered me to do this because I have never attempted suicide before. I don't even remember how bad of shape I was in when I entered the hospital, but from what everyone told me I almost died, and had it not been for my friend's mom rushing me to the hospital as fast as she did, I would be dead instead of writing this.</bodytext></report>
