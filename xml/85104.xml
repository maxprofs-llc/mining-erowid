This is my description of a low dosage in my opinion of Oxymorphone. I use fine cannabis daily and recreationally use opiods every 2 months or so. Along with that, I usually take Oxycodone but my usual dealer was out and suggested these Oxymorphone's in place explaining to me how they both work similar. This was my first experience with Oxymorphone. I mentioned how I used Cannabis. I used around 3 bowls and it maintained sedation mostly while eliminating most paranoia.

Description of mindset &amp; setting 
/n
/n
My mindset was to experience sedation and euphoria in excess amounts around 11pm on a weekday night. The setting was in a basement low temp of 62 degrees farenheit. This time, I was by myself playing video games all night and had nothing else planned.

Details of any preparations made for the experience
/n
/n
Cutting the outer tan layer off the 10 MG pill's using razor blade. Cannabis readily available as Cannabis reacts as a natural remedy to me. Drink and dry food which I rarely used.

Dosage &amp; timing information
/n
/n
11pm - Cut the outer layer off the two 10mg pills using razor blade. I then insufflated 10mg of Oxymorphone.
/n
/n
11:15pm - Eager to feel effects, I insufflated the other 10mg of Oxymorphone I had.
/n
/n
12:00am - After sitting around playing video games I glanced around and noticed everything was slow motion kinda like Oxycodone. Comparatively feeling, I felt as if I had taken about 30mg of Oxycontin and was feeling it full on. I thought it would be like this the rest of the night...
/n
/n
1:30am - I wrote my own reports at the time (about 5 days ago) and this is what I was experiencing. Every 30 minutes, intermittent paranoia for around 3 minutes and then complete BLISS EUPHORIA imagining I could do anything.

Adverse Effects: Paranoia 
/n
/n
2:30am - I am estimating 2:30 AM as I do not completely recall cause i was so sedated to the point Ive never experienced. I was trying to watch TV without completely falling over and trying to keep my eyes open. I was not tired, I probably woke up around 11 hours earlier and did nothing all day. I specifically posted this to my journal:
/n
/n
'I layed here closing my eyes listening to a movie that I interpreted by listening but completely missed the point and everything about the real thing [what was really going on in the movie].'
/n
/n
Basically completely in my own world with my eyes closed but open them and look around to reality. I specifically mentioned jitters which could be a immediate withdrawal symptom.
/n
/n
3:00am?: Im guessing around 3 I passed out
/n
/n
3:00pm next day: I woke up completely sick coughing and cold and am still sick to this day (5 days later). Other than that withdrawal was not bad especially when I smoke bowls of Cannabis, but I do remember getting really weird heightened senses at times almost reminding me I wanted the drug again. I also looked up 'heroin addict' on youtube the next day and it reminded me of myself the night before. I also snorted an Oxycontin 40mg 2 days later that did absolutely nothing compared to what it used to do to me.
