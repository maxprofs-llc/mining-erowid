Background: I am a 19 year-old male college student, 5 ft. 10 in. tall, and weighing in at 145 lbs. I am a regular Cannabis and Tobacco user. I have used on multiple past occasions: Dextromethorphan, Opiate painkillers, JWH-018, and Alprazolam (Xanax). I have also experienced 'Shrooms' three times, LSD (1 potent tab) once, LSA (Morning Glory tea) about 5 times, and one nightmarish Salvia breakthrough in which I ran around the yard slamming into fences. I used Adderall XR 20mg for ADHD on and off throughout my childhood (6 years+) and it now causes me to fear for the health of my heart. Also, I have been having mild/moderate panic attacks almost daily for about 2 weeks, a recently developed 'panic disorder.'

Preparation: 1000 mgs of 5-MEO-DALT are mixed with 100 ml of 89% Ethanol in a VERY flat, square glass (Pyrex) baking tray. The powder seems to be insoluble in this solution, so I stir it vigorously for 10 minutes. The clumps now seem broken down fairly well, and I place the tray across a stove burner on low to evaporate the ethanol, once again, making sure that the pan is flat and level. Once the ethanol has evaporated completely I was left with a fairly consistent powder layer on the bottom of the tray.

(WARNING: I do not recommend using this method of measuring out dosages in MG! The solvent used in the situation was not appropriate and even if you are working with a solvent that works for your substance(s), the baking tray must be COMPLETELY flat and level, as to avoid higher concentrations of your chem on one side or in random places on your glass tray due to pooling solvent.)

Using a ruler, I measure 10x10 (100) even squares and mark them out with a razor blade, carefully making a grid out of the powder in the baking tray. Paper Towel squares (100) were cut to the size of each square in the grid now cut into the powder on the baking pan. Each square of paper towel (about 1'x1') is wet with a spray of vegetable oil, and placed on top of a square of the grid in the pan, then slid outward to the edge of the pan while pressing down, to capture the powdered DALT.

Finally, each paper towel square was folded shut, and stuffed into an empty size 00 gel capsule. This was repeated for the remaining 99 squares of paper towel.

Experience: T+00:00- One gel capsule containing assumably ~10mgs (+/- ~5mg) of 5-MEO-DALT was taken orally, with a glass of root beer and some grilled chicken. Freaknik: The Musical was on TV. A friend, who I will call 'A', came over to 'trip sit.'

T+00:15- I am feeling slightly altered, but not enough to know in what way. A and I pack a bowl of some high-grade Cannabis.

T+00:20-A asks me how I'm feeling. I answer that I'm feeling it, but that right now it's just a tingling in the body. On the come-up I was quite cautious, enough to have killed the fun of the experience but it's ok. I was constantly trying to differentiate normal bodily functions from drug side effects and watch out for panic attack symptoms (I actually didn't have any of these!). A and I finish smoking our bowl in the meantime and about 30 minutes after dosing-

T+00:30- I am definitely 'feeling it.' My body is buzzing hard, and for the very few seconds I can stop worrying about watching out for side effects and checking my pulse (which seemed steady, with a rate within normal limits, but strong), I am in a wonderful mood. It's very hard to define this feeling. I feel as though it was only a glimpse of what this drug can do, as even though it seemed 'intense' in a way, it was faint and indefinable. I couldn't put words on how I felt altered at all, other than 'My body is buzzing... or tingling a little, like when you're on shrooms but it doesn't feel as much like sex.'
/n

T+00:45 I am peaked, and have been for a few minutes. Same feeling as before, just stronger slightly. I am in a great mood when I'm not worrying about a panic/heart attack. It is interesting to note that at this point, Freaknik: The Musical had to be turned off, because it was 'too much' for me to watch. It felt as if all the colors and sounds and seas O' booty-shakin' was an overload of nonsensical information. My head started to hurt and I changed the channel to King of the Hill. This was the only moment like it throughout the 'trip.' A and I go outside to pack another bowl now.
/n

I started to come down at about T+01:00. At T+2:00 I am no longer feeling the DALT, or much of the weed, but I've got the munchies real bad, and like another user has reported, my munchies seemed logical and almost healthy compared to the stupidly sugary foods I get the munchies for on weed alone. I was craving burgers and steak, real foods I rarely have an appetite for.

Summary: I'm definitely interested in trying this substances in increasing dosages, but next time, I will try smoking the same amount. Thus far, it SEEMS fairly safe in small doses, my heart did not race, and though my breathing became deeper (that's a personal side effect of any psychedelic on me, because breathing deep while tripping feels wonderful), and my pupils were very dilated, no other obvious physical side effects were noted. Also, there were no negative emotional side effects. I felt uplifted and if anything, and more relaxed, though the relaxed feeling is what we call 'stoned.' Until next time, stay safe, stay educated.</bodytext></report>
