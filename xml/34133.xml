I just wanted to say that Trazodone can be used as a nice recreational drug. A bunch of my friends and I always love to take trazis but we don't swallow them, we insufflate them. They're a bit harsh but sort of sweet as well. They mix very well with a few beers or a little to drink...very nice sedative feeling...relaxation. No adverse side-effects for me.</bodytext></report>
