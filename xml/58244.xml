In college I never even touched drugs or alcohol.  But after 25 years in the work force I just got worn down.

I noticed my consumption of alcohol was getting out of hand so I thought I would try something different.

I was very skeptical especially after a brief time with prescription drugs.

I read about Kratom and just thought I would try it.  I ordered some and made some tea out of the concentrated powder.  It was nasty tasting but downed it and after a while a tremendous sense of contentment swept over me and I could rest without worrying about something.  My dog hopped up to great me and for the first time in about 5 years I was very happy.

I slept and rested about 12 hours!!  It is usual for me to only experience maybe 6-7 hours of rest a day.
