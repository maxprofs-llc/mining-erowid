I have been taking kratom for a few months now.  My dosage has remained a constant quarter ounce.  I seldom mix any drugs or medications with my kratom, so what I feel is definitely due to the kratom only.

Having been on pain medication for a year, I can tell you that kratom mimics the hydrocodone high but with a little more sociability.  It is a friendly, somewhat obnoxious euphoria, like St. Joseph's cocaine for children.  Unfortunately, kratom doesn't kill pain as well, as I found with a recent kidney stone.  It also tends to make urination a little difficult.  If I discontinue it after extended use, I get withdrawals similar to opiate withdrawals, only without cramping.

So, why do I use it?  It works better than alcohol.  I can drive and operate heavy machinery; and, I feel GOOD for about three hours.  It is legal and available from the internet.

I only get the effects that I like with Bali kratom.  I add it to water, microwave it and drink the mixture.  I don't ever get used to the taste.  The effects come on in about ten minutes.  It won't change my life, but I may find myself looking forward to getting home after work, taking kratom and hanging with the family.</bodytext></report>
