I used yarrow instead of tobacco for a mix 1 day and found myself in a real relaxed state. I have tryed it by it's self and felt a slight relaxed feeling but I get the same if I drink it as a tea as well. Since then if I don't have any tobacco I use yarrow and it surprises me every time.</bodytext></report>
