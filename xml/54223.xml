About an hour or so ago - popped 150mg of tramadol (Ultram) hcl (three
/n
pills so far). 
/n
/n
12:38pm (now) - popped one more to make it 200mg after reading up on the pills online a little bit. feeling mildly sedated but still up at 
/n
the same time. i like this high a lot. i'm waiting for my 
/n
friend to deliver my weed to me. i can't wait for the full 200mg
/n
to kick in so i can see what this stuff is all about.
/n
listening to The Futureheads and it sounds alright. i may be
/n
changing the music soon.
/n
/n
12:42pm - decide to change the music to Gnarls Barkley. definitely feeling the 
/n
pills but i'm not used to them so i don't know what to be expecting
/n
or anything. i'm going to continue reading about the pills. the 
/n
body high kind of feels like ecstasy. somewhat euphoric. mild 
/n
jitters etc.
/n
/n
12:48 - my weed is here!! i'm going to roll up a skimp cigarillo and see if the
/n
weed heightens the high at all. i find myself making a lot of typing
/n
mistakes. finishing up a cigarette. thinking alot about Gnarls Barkley
/n
and how genious the group is. breaking up weed as i write this.
/n
/n
1am - blunt lit. hands were very clumsy and shaky while rolling it. it's very
/n
small but it will do the job. sweating mildly. very jittery. almost
/n
uncomfortable but the weed is chilling me out as i type this.
/n
/n
1:05 - blunt is becoming a roach. feeling very good. very very good. sedated.
/n
dreamy. very good. realizing tramadol and weed is a very very very very
/n
good combo. i may roll up another cigarillo in a little while if i'm
/n
feeling up to it. dazed. i fall into very deep dazes in with the music
/n
every once in a while. thinking about putting on some ambient/electronic
/n
music. hot hot heat is playing at the moment. feeling very lazy.
/n
/n
1:08 - Mouse on Mars - Idiology album begins. i put on a pair of stereo headphones at 1:10. feeling wild. music is very loud in the headphones.
/n
/n
1:14 - turn itunes visualizer on. the visualizer puts me in a daze.
/n
/n
1:17 - slightly numb in my mouth for some reason. i decide to put on a crazy
/n
song by rjd2. no more visualizer for now. very fucked up. smoking a
/n
cigarette. this report is going to be very interesting to read. i've
/n
been reading many reports similar to what is unfolding here. this drug
/n
... tramadol.... i like this drug. although i got these pills for free..
/n
i would, without a doubt, pay for more. they're very good. i just seem
/n
to keep getting more and more fucked up. I LOVE IT..
/n
/n
1:21 - reading over my report so far. i like it. this is just getting started..
/n
i can tell. RJD2 - 1976 is BANGIN' in my headphones. Ghostwriter by
/n
the same band begins... sounds very good. music is becoming a journey..
/n
each song is a different journey. all the music i'm playing right now
/n
is instrumental/electronic. so no lyrics. i'm thinking about putting
/n
on some good rock. feeling very good. i go get a cup of water and
/n
turn the light off in my room at 1:25.
/n
/n
1:26 - Such Great Heights - The Postal Service begins... this music is so
/n
amazing. the heart put into the songs. the postal service is genious.
/n
the pills are great. but i'm just gonna let it flow from here on. the
/n
music causes tons of emotion.. it's all wonderful. i lovvvve this. closing
/n
eyes liping the lyrics. when i close my eyes the music flows through me.
/n
minor CEV's. my body is moving in all sorts of ways to the music. sort
/n
of dancing while sitting down. i don't dance. good feelings are all over
/n
the place at 1:29. 
/n
/n
1:30 - brand new colony - the postal service begins... i IM a friend. mild
/n
nausia begins. the music is great. i like the faster pace of this track.
/n
there's no way i would want to drive on this drug/n
note.  /n drinking lots of water just to keep hydrated.
/n
/n
1:36 - explosions in the sky starts. i just changed into my night time clothes.
/n
feeling good but tired. debating whether to smoke more weed. myspace
/n
is a very very useful tool. one of the best thing's i've seen in the
/n
2000's. the music is wonderful as usual.
/n
/n
1:43 - music is great. talking to two friends. feeling good. getting
/n
into deep conversation about drugs with one of my friends. almost
/n
coming down. i wanna smoke more weed. i don't feel like rolling a blunt.
/n
feeling dazed and tired but happy. the music is fueling me at the moment.
/n
/n
1:53 - i turn the light on to roll up a cigarillo but i'm trying a different
/n
method of rolling. (using joint roller). hoping it'll work.
/n
/n
2:01 - mini blunt lit. burning nice and slow. it's like a fat joint-sized
/n
cigar. rolled with perfection. it hits like a dream.i'm gonna be 
/n
ripped.
/n
/n
2:07 - the blunt is almost done. i can't believe i just texted the girl of my
/n
dreams.
/n
/n
2:10 - blunt is done. i'm having a flirtatious text message conversation with the
/n
girl of my dreams. WHAT?! i'm for real. explosions in the sky is one
/n
of the best of all time. simple as that. i just felt a very euphoric
/n
feeling. it was very random. but it was welcomed once it came on. this
/n
drug is WILD.
/n
/n
2:14 - i spark up a cigarette. the album 'The Rescue' - Explosions in The Sky is
/n
one of the most emotional albums i have ever heard. this band has so
/n
much heart. i love finding REAL MUSIC. Day Three - explosions.... this
/n
track is unbelievable. i'm happy. almost ready for sleep. the cigarette
/n
is very good. camel lights are very rich.
/n
/n
2:18 - appreciatin' my cigs. lol. this drug is minorly similar to ecstasy which
/n
is unbelieveable. the marijuana jets this drug out of control... but i
/n
love it. this music is CRAZY. 
/n
/n
2:21 - i've calmed down a lot since the beginning of this trip report. i like
/n
it a lot more now than i did then. my mind wonders easily now. but
/n
i can bring it back very fast. the music is still fueling me. this
/n
would be nothing without the music. the soundtrack to this night is
/n
classic because it made my night for me.
/n
/n
2:24 - i decide it's getting late and that it's almost time for sleep. it will
/n
come easily in the state i'm in at the moment. i'm on track five of an 
/n
8 track album. i think i'll finish it and go to sleep. i couldn't
/n
NOT finish this album. it's too good to be ended so quickly. i'm surprised
/n
music is this appreciated on this drug. i'm wondering if i'm one of 
/n
few that have used this drug for it's opaiate ability and not just for
/n
back pain or if a lot of people use it for this. i love this drug.
/n
i'll defiitely come out of this trip with more kowledge...
/n
which is very good. i may or may not do these again. i have enough for 
/n
two more trips equal dosage to the one i'm on now (200mg, four pills).
/n
as a side note i will mention that i broke the pills in half before
/n
i took them so the effects would come on quicker. just incase i forget
/n
that small bit.
/n
/n
2:30 - smoking a cigarette. this girl is so cute. i wish she was here next to 
/n
me right now. on track 6 going on track 7 now. i tidy up my room a bit
/n
before laying down to go to sleep. flipped the light off in the begining
/n
of the seventh track. my legs feel kind of numb. i like it. laying down
/n
is gonna feel so good. mildly sweating. thinking about that girl that i
/n
can carry on a conversation so well with.
/n
/n
2:36 - begining of the last track of the album. this is about it for the night!
/n
i'm just gonna chill to this song. close my eyes and melt. the track is
/n
mildly upbeat. this it for the night. i'll update in the morning.
/n
/n
2:38 - i turn off the computer and lay down for sleep. the trip has been long 
/n
and good.
/n
/n
/n
[next day]
/n
12:07pm - i feel very worn down today. very lazy. these pills definitely come
/n
with a hang over. nothing too bad. but i can tell it's there. my
/n
morning has been bad because there's a kid that has been blowing up
/n
my phone since 8am and he has not stopped calling. i guess he needs a
/n
ride somewhere. but yeah, after a shower i'm hoping i won't feel so
/n
worn down and tired today. i'm going to read over my report from last
/n
night. 
/n
/n
12:19 - falling asleep last night, from what i can remember, was very easy. i
/n
remember my body was twitching a lot. way way more than usual. the
/n
twitching was definitely caused by the pills. i kinda remember having
/n
minor CEVs before falling asleep which were kind of keeping me from
/n
completely relaxing. i'm really tired still. bout to get in the shower.
/n
/n
12:25 - i hop in the shower.
/n
/n
12:43 - exiting shower. realizing that i came out of this trip with a lot more 
/n
than i originally thought i came out of it with. i'm having the urge
/n
to try something new! i want to impress someone or go to the beach or
/n
something i don't normally do! i want to adventure somewhere that i've
/n
never been. i have a feeling this trip has pushed me to try new things.
/n
i don't know why or how exactly... but i like it. still feeling mild
/n
effects. feeling refreshed after my shower. i feel motivated but tired.
/n
it's all good. i may or may not expiriment with these pills again soon.
/n
/n
[EDIT!]
/n
1:08pm - slight nausea led to projectile vomiting everything out of my stomach (just water). it was horrible but i feel better now. i hadnt eaten last night or this morning, so maybe now i'll eat something. i was not expecting that.
/n
/n
2:30 - first bit of food in 15 hours. slice of pizza. not much of an appetite but i know i need to eat. I'm basically forcing it down.</bodytext></report>
