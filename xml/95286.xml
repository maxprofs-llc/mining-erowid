I took MXE the day before yesterday and am only now fully recovering from the effects of the drug.  A friend brought up a bag of what she thought was ketamine at the time, and I proceeded to sniff about 80mg in one line.  I now know snorting isnt exactly the done thing with this stuff.

My nose burnt like hell, and eyes watered like mad straight away.  About ten minutes in the film I had put on started to distort, words being elongated, overlapping sounds and at the same time unable to find where they are coming from.

Then I experienced a shrill vibrating noise, seemed to be coming from inside my head, but all over the room at the same time.

I walked into the hallway and was met with a trip of pristine white staircases, travelling upwards there was a portrait of my mum at every level, and upon reaching the top I was met with out-of-my-eyes vision again, which freaked me out no end and I began to panic.

Alice in wonderland syndrome was evident, although at the time I didnt know of this and was shouting its just like alice in wonderland in here.  Small items in my kitchen like an empty rum bottle kept me anchored to reality temporarily, but a deep breath or a panicked intake of breath would push me back out of my body again, I felt like I saw different realms, doorways with different physics to ours, lone trees in massive landscapes for example.. Hard to recount but really really eye opening stuff..

I was convinced this was the end, my head kept leaving my body and resurfacing somewhere else, I was apologising and blubbering to god to satan to stop the vibrations in my head, I was convinced my brain couldnt handle this foreign substance (verbally I said foreign secretaries apparently) and that I was going to die here in my kitchen, my limbs jerked everywhere for some reason, more like a possession than the k hole I was expecting. After about two hours and my friends telling me to ride the trip out I began to plateau to a level of control again, I found I had blood all over my arms and had scratched a massive patch of skin off my elbow, the blood was from my nose which had been pissing blood since I tried to force the chemical back out of during my trip. I also remember my hands were moving really slowly but I knew I was moving them very fast!

On the whole, a very real experience that I cannot wait to feel again, the synthensysia especially, I felt I could feel my sight it sounds weird but my vision was like running water..

I would do it again and deffinitly feel its addictive quality.</bodytext></report>
