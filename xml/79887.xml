I first started smoking weed at 15 and I loved it. But about half a year later, I got bored of it so I tried other things such as shrooms, extacy, LSD, and salvia.

By the end of the school year, I got prescribed with Zolof and Abilify and I had this curiosity of snorting these pills. I've heard Abilify could do something, so I snorted 30 mg of it.

My body was tingling everywhere and I wanted to dance non-stop. It was pretty fun, its kinda like sugar high but a bit more better than that. But since I'm prescribed, I had to take a bigger dosage. My other friends take about 20 mg and that trips them out in a way, so I guess abilify is alright.</bodytext></report>
