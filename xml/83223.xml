Im a very experienced psychedelic user that would have an easier time listing the chems/drugs I haven't tried instead of the ones I have tried so Im not gonna waste a few hundred words before the trip report thats gonna bore you to death.

I picked up 500mgs 4-ACO-DIPT from a trusted source and have been waiting for the right moment to try out this new batch. Back in 2003 I tried this chem for the first time and it blew my mind to say the least, but that was 6 years ago. Does it still feel as good as I remembered?? I weighed out 30mgs and put it in a capsule. I had tried it at this dose back in 03 and I knew I could handle it. I had eaten a small meal 3 hours before so I physically felt good before going into the trip.

9:45pm, I swallowed the capsule. I was antsy in the few minutes after taking the capsule, so I decided to go run a nice warm bubble bath and invite my wife who was going to be my sitter.

10:00, pupils were huge in the mirror next to the tub.  Im starting to feel energy build inside me, NICE!! I wash fast so I can relax for a while in the tub while I wait for my wife to make it. She gets in and I am feeling GREAT!! It been 30 min and this chem is not wasting its time. My wifes naked, soapy, bubbly body feels great to the touch. We held each other for a while and then I feel the need to sit up because I was getting antsy again, huge energy push! My wife sees my 'member' is rising to occasion so she strokes me in the tub till its rock hard. Even though Im enjoying this almost TOO much, I decide I need to get out of the tub before the peak.

10:45, I move into the living room to the chill spot. I have my liquid projector casting an ever moving swirl of blue and red on my walls to enhance whatever visual component the 4-aces offer. I put on a little TOOL on the stereo and laid back. My body was buzzing with pleasure. I did notice a somewhat strong tremor mainly in the legs but it wasn't nothing to worry about, mentally and physically I was in heaven. This drug delivers a strong rushing sensation unlike any other tryptamine Ive ever tried. This is extacy!

11:00, My wife finishes up in the bath and joins me on the sofa. Shes feeling a little playful so she asked me if I wanted to move the party to the bed. YES I DO!!  We crawl into bed and believe or not, all I wanted to do was nuzzle her skin with my nose and lips and just 'feel' her. She tries to get my dick hard again but he was not feeling up to the old 'pull, jerk' method she was using. Her mouth would've made it hard but I guess she wasnt feeling that playful. After a few frustrating minutes she reccommends moving back to the living room and putting on a flick. YES! I love porn.

11:45, enjoying the peak alot. Smoked some bud and that really hit the spot. Now we've been watching porn for 20min or so but my dick is still down for the count.  He needed mouth to mouth but she wasnt willing so back in the boxers he goes. I turn the flick off and decided to set back, close my eyes and enjoy the moment instead of becoming sexually frustrated. CEV's were there but I had to think hard to see, or make out anything. I did not see anything worth noting. OEV's were about like a low dose of shrooms. Patterns on the wall paper looked like they were moving and everything looked a bit fuzzy but Im sure that was because my pupils were huge! I hang out on the sofa for another hour until I felt the effects start to drop off.

1:15, Im feeling very light effects at the moment but still feeling awesome.  I decide I can go to sleep if I try so we turn off all the lights and go to bed. While there I did manage a nice explosive orgasm but it took some work.

1:45, turned off the lights and went straight to sleep.

This chemical is great! It feels like 2 or 3 good hits of x with a low dose of mushrooms. I never felt nausea or any ill effects from the 4-aces. Woke up at 8am the next morning feeling like a million bucks. No headache or any other strung out feeling to speak of. Im looking foward to doing this again. . . . soon.</bodytext></report>
