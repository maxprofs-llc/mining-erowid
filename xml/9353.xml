i managed to acquire some 5 mg dextroamphetamine tablets from a kid in my form who's brother is A.D.D. it was the weekend coming up and my parents were going away on holiday leaving me the house for friday, saturday, sunday and monday ;) i went to school friday and scored 10 pills for $20 aus. i had to walk home after school and i pretty much power walked all the way home i was that amped to go a couple of rails. i got home and chopped up half a pill and railed it straight up. i didnt really notice the effects greatly, so i railed another 1/4 pill an hour later. this got me going, and i was in a great mood and had quite a nice amount of energy. nothing too drastic and nothing in comparison to the speed i had the weekend before. i bounced around the house that afternoon doing chores and shit that would normally bore me shitless, then i went out to my mates.

when i got there everyone was rather quiet and drinking their alcohol while i was rather talkative and happy. i had a great amount of energy, and was amped to do something other than sit around bored. while waiting for them to get pissed i downed half a pill orally and waited for its effects. we got a video camera and headed into town. we bombed the town with stickers of a skate shop, and generally just had a good time. i didnt really notice the oral dose come on, it rather extended and slightly intensified what i was already feeling. i found that i could jump higher than normal, may have just been an illusion though. so anyway we head back to my mates and just sat around before everyone felt like going to bed. it was 2:00 in the morning and i was still feeling pretty awake.

i got on my bike and rode home slowly, noticing that my vision was a lot clearer and i could see a lot easier in the dark. i got home and did some more cleaning and shit before going to bed at around 3:30. i found it pretty easy to fall asleep and had a good sleep too. when i awoke i was feeling good and not drained, so i went and chopped up half a pill and railed it about 30 mins after i got up. i went and had a shower and was feeling pretty good about life and was in a positive mindframe. i then watched some 'up in smoke', but my television wasnt loud enough and it was pissing me off so i hooked it up to the stereo and cranked it. i was so damn amped it wasnt funny. i was having a great time, and decided i should go another half. so i did another half and bounced around to up in smoke in my boxers for pretty much the rest of the day. i didnt really eat a great deal that day but i had plenty of energy.

i then had another shower as i had been sweating all day and went to my friends house again. i decided to do another 1/4 of a pill nasally before i left and took another 3/4 with me pre-chopped. i got to my friends and they were all drinking alcohol again, already on their ways to being pissed, while i was just bouncing around in a great mood. then we got the idea to go to the movies so we headed out and watched planet of the apes. we bought our tickets and headed into the cinema. when we got in there they pulled out there piss and continued to drink. i was going to do my 3/4 that i brought with me, but they wanted some of it, so we all headed to the toilets and i split it into 3 lines and we all had some. we headed back into the movies and sat down. i had a sick time, it was a fucken mad movie, and i can remember it really good. i understood every bit of the movie and it all came together in my head.

after the movie we were all amped, and it seemed as though they were getting effect of like a 1/4 pill, as they were very energetic and going into the movie they were quite sedated. we went back and grabbed the camera before heading back into town to do some fun shit. we just did the same as night before but cained a few wheelie bins and porta toilet before heading back for some bongs. everyone had one and then they all passed out. i was about to head home and then it started raining. i was pretty angry about it, coz i didnt want to go to sleep and i wanted to get some munchies at home, but i ended up cribbing at his house.

i woke up in the morning in a great mood and went to red rooster for some food. the rest of the day i just mellowed at home and remembered the weekend that was. i was pretty amped for some more, but i wanted to save my last pills for my exams coming up ;) hahah

effects roundup:

i noticed a slight increase in heart rate (didnt want to focus too much on it, as i have tripped out more than once on the speed of my heart on drugs =] lol) but nothing too major. when the drug was still in effect i was always in a good mood, but when it started to wear off i was a bit edgy. thoughts were always flowing through my mind, and found it very easy to express myself and put forth my ideas. i was very creative in my wording and i seemed more intellectual than normal. i never had any problems on my dose, and while althought small, i did notice the effects. them consisting mainly of energy, mood lift, clearer thoughts, increase in heart rate/shallower respiration, and a greater understanding of life at the time. i managed to do multiple chores at once and keep new ones fresh in my mind, and i did a fair amount of housework in a shorter time than normal.

ps: if anyone knows how I can filter any of the fillers and junk out of the dexedrine tablets so i am not snorting anything other than the amphetamine, would you please email me at wiseone_dxm@hotmail.com. thankyou.
