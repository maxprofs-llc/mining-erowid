On reduction from 30mg of Seroxate (i.e. trying to come off the medication), I found that I had to reduce them by a 1/4 tablet at a time. Took that dose for about 3-4 weeks, then reduced by another 1/4 tablet. This way side effects were bearable, but were still rather uncomfortable and anoying. They included in my case:
/n
/n
Dizziness, Nauseousness and balance problems due to eye movement.
/n
Feelings of going up and down in a lift, irrespective of standing, sitting, laying, eyes open or closed.
/n
/n
Why do I have these problems, if this drug is as non-addictive as the doctors told me?</bodytext></report>
