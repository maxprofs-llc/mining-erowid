I had always wanted to use some sort of psychadelic drug before and 'trip', but I've never had the opportunity.  I've never had a lot of friends that were into that and I have been in a military setting for several years.  I did have one opportunity to do so, however, while my wife was out of town.  What inspired me was, oddly enough, an episode of South Park.  There is one where a bunch of kids at their school are discovered to be getting high off of cough medicine.  That made me remember a rumor about that I had heard back in high school, so I decided to read up about it on the internet.  I found out it was true and decided to try it out.  I had been frustrated with work and some personal things recently and really wanted some sort of release.

I went out and got a bottle of Robitussin and figured out what a safe dosage was from internet research.  I got a suggested dose for first timers and since I need to take more than the recommended dosage for pills when I've been prescribed them I decided to take between that and an average dose.  To prepare for this I turned off my cell phone and unplugged my regular phone and I hooked up my laptop to my projector TV in the basement.  I also got a pair of headphones and turned on the visualization program.  I also made a special mix called 'trippy' that was made up of mellow songs and techno/ambient type stuff.   Nothing that I felt would negatively influence my mood.

After getting everything ready, I went ahead and downed a bottle that had roughly 230ml of DXM in it.  It didn't taste that bad.  I had read that it took about an hour for the drug to kick in and that I might experience some nausea.  I was next to a bathroom so that wasn't a problem.  While waiting for the effects to hit me I switched the projector from the PC to TV and watched a sports show I had recorded which lasted less than 30 minutes.  Then I watched about half way through the first quarter of Monday Night Football.  I didn't feel too much going on.  I wasn't nauseous or very high.  I started to get sleepy.  I decided that watching football might be making me think too much or something, so I decided to listen to some music and watch the visualization program.

I started to feel bored, but I noticed that I wasn't sleepy anymore.  I didn't think I was high, but I thought it was very strange that I was being so attentive to the graphics.  I started to feel like I was just being stupid and trying to make myself pretend like I was high because I wanted to experience a psychadelic trip so badly.  I have tried things like this before in the past, like taking too much percocet after going to the dentist, and either nothing happened or I made myself sick.  I figured this was another occasion like that.

Then I had my first odd feeling.  One of the things that the visualizer does is a graphic will start where a bunch of crap comes zooming towards me really fast, like I'm flying into a space nebula or something.  One of those things started and I got really excited.  I found myself transfixed by it and couldn't look away and started to feel like I was actually going somewhere, but at the same time a part of me knew what was happening and said that I was just being stupid and pretending to feel that way.  The images stopped zooming around and settled onto one type of thing that vibrated along with the music.  I thought it looked like a giant squid.  After staring at the squid for a while, it went away and I still didn't think I was high.  I decided that maybe I would get more Robitussin and see if that did anything since I did feel a little strange with the squid.  I had been lying on my back on my couch this whole time, with my arms resting on my chest.

When I picked up one of my hands, it felt heavy.  I picked up the other one, and that felt heavy, too.  I looked back at the iTunes graphics on the wall and realized that I didn't really want to look away.  It was really hard to get up.  My mind was still struggling with how real these feelings were, because it didn't feel like I was drunk, I felt like I could think very clearly and I knew what was happening, but at the same time I am not usually enthralled by visualizers to the point where it's hard to get off the couch.  It was like I was high and not high at the same time.  I finally sat up, and I felt really strange.  I then stood up and felt even stranger.  Now things become really hard to describe.  I remember deciding that I was definitely some type of high and was not faking it to myself.  I didn't think I was high enough, though, and it still wasn't very late, so I was going to drive down the road to get some more Robitussin (not the best decision, but oh well).

I resolved to get in my car and go, but I couldn't stop looking around the basement.  It was the same, but it seemed different, almost like I was seeing it for the first time.  Also, every time I would like back at the graphics (which were still projected onto the wall) it was hard to tear myself away from them.  Several times I was about to go back upstairs but looked at the wall and just sat there with my mouth open for a while.  I finally walked upstairs and once I got there had the same new/not new feeling.  I remember looking around with my jaw open.

I grabbed my keys and started driving to the store.  The same feeling stuck with me.  I didn't feel like I driving badly and the store wasn't far away, so I felt all right.  Once I got there, it's hard again to describe how I felt but I would say it was like I was an alien who was trying to fit into human society.  I walked into the drugstore and thought that everything was fascinating, but I knew that this wasn't 'good' so I tried to locate the cough medicine.  Somewhere between looking at contact lens solutions and vitamins I finally found it.  I picked up the same kind I got earlier that day.  While I was waiting in line I realized I hadn't talked at all since I started tripping.  I wasn't sure that my voice still worked or that I could actually talk.  At this point I really did start feeling like an alien imposter.  I managed to say some normal stuff to the guy at the cash register and was really proud of myself.  I drove back home and downed about 2/3 of the new bottle.

Immediately I began to feel sick.  After only a few minutes I ran in the bathroom and puked up my dinner.  I had read that was to be expected, but it usually came about 30 minutes after ingesting the DXM, so I thought that dose might have been wasted.  I went ahead and drank the last 1/3 of the bottle.  I laid back down on the couch and resumed listening to music.  I let myself go and tried to shut off the logical part of my mind and became absorbed my the music and the glowing graphics.  At some point I started tripping harder.  I started to notice that songs seemed to take a long time to finish.  I would find myself singing along with something and when it got to the end I couldn't believe how long I had been listening to that song because it seemed like forever.  I also started talking to myself out loud.  When the visualizer would make strange shape I would yell out 'What the f**k is that??!' and just stare at it in wonder.  This went on for a while.

One thing I noticed was that I really enjoyed the songs on my 'trippy' mix.  Several of them were songs that I had always thought would either sound awesome while on drugs or that whoever wrote them was on drugs at the time.  One was Glass and the Ghost Children by Smashing Pumpkins.  It starts off pretty structured but then gets very disjointed.  Usually I get annoyed at the disjointed part and will skip to another song.  It goes into some tape recorded monologue after the structured part and then has some ambient sounds, then some more singing, and it ends up more structured and normal.  I found that I loved listening to every second of this song.  I thought the monologue was especially fascinating.  This sort of thing happened with a bunch of songs.  This is a long song by sober standards, and it seemed like I listened to it for an hour while high.  I switched playlists at some point to get more variety.  I noticed that fast songs seemed to be slowed down and also took a long time to listen to.

A little while later, I got overwhelmed with a feeling of deep loneliness.  I think it was brought on by the fact I didn't have anyone there to share this experience with me and also due to some personal stuff going on, but it was a very deep and sad feeling.  After a while it was all I could think about.  I also started examining myself and what type of person I am.  I would bounce around between thinking about that, to wishing that I had someone with me while I was tripping, and a multitude of personal issues.  I wouldn't say that this turned it into a bad trip, but it wasn't what I wanted to think about the whole time.  I kept finding that I wished I had my best from high school with me.

At some point I decided I needed to go upstairs where my desktops are.  I left myself some interesting audio recordings.  They were mainly me weakly singing along to some songs and saying random things.  I remember being disappointed by the lack of insightful, imaginative thoughts I was having.  After that I went back downstairs and watched the visualizer some more.  I started getting sleepy again and began dozing off slightly.  I started having really weird half-dreams and started seeing things in the shapes.  Soon after that I went to sleep.

All in all I thought it was a pretty cool experience.  I read that you're not supposed to do it too often with DXM, but I have one more chance to do it in the next few days and I plan on doing it again.  It's a cheap high, it lasts for hours, and there's virtually no hangover or crash.  Hopefully one day I'll be able to experience this with somebody.</bodytext></report>
