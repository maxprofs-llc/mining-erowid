The doctor said I have endogenus depression so I started with 75mg/day of venlafaxine and other non-relevant pharmaceuticals. Then the dose was increased, 1 pill at day and 1 pill at night, I had some difficults to sleep but I managed to sleep well.

My life continued as expected, very well and I started to think that the venlafaxine was rather expensive, and I started to reduce the dose, but in 3 days I started to feel dizzy and started to feel electric shocks in my body.

The 9 months I had been taking Venlafaxine showed themselves, so I think in my vacations I'll quit abruptly the medication, because If I do it now It can be dangerous at college.

The Venlafaxine is very addictive, at least If you're going to become addict to something, choose something cheaper :(</bodytext></report>
