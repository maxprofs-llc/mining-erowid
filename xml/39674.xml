From late childhood to when I was 16 I suffered from migraines and cluster head aches. I was 16 when I first time tripped on mushrooms and what struck me was I was used to the pain cycle of having a migraine every forthnight and then some period of calm and the a period of cluster head aches, well both of these had not shown up at all for several months after my initial trip. I concluded that I could only attribute it to my trips on psilocybin. I then embarked on a journey of 6 years of psychonautic exploration. From 1990-1996 I had NO migraines and zero cluster head aches.

I have since then done psychedelics a very few number of times until winter 2003-04 and all of 04 I have had violent attacks of the former and the latter I then dosed my self with fresh handpicked P. semilanceata = and have had no migraines or clusters since. I am now back on track more ready than ever to preach the gospel of entheogens and chemical compounds. This need to be scientifically studied. That's all for now
