Just to get the fun stuff out of the way I am an 18 year old male, I have done mushrooms, acid, mescaline, Yage (Ayahuasca), and some of the classics (weed and what not) I only do hallucinogenic drugs (with the exception of weed, alcohol, and kava) and wile I will occasionally smoke or drink I do not do it very often at all and have in fact done more mushrooms then weed. Neither now nor at the time of this am I taking any medication and I had not drank or smoked within a week of this experience.

So basically hears the deal, I got my hands on some mescaline a few months ago in the form of one of the legal san Pedro cacti, the Bridgesii variety. After one failed attempt at a trip (I received some seriously bad information as to where the majority of the alkaloids are situated) I succeeded in experiencing one of the greatest hallucinogens on this earth, but I digress because this isnt about  my mescaline trip which I dont feel was particularly exciting nor worthy of writing a report on (maybe next time), but instead this is reserved for the twenty or so minutes spent tripping on both salvia and mescaline.

I had some salvia lying around from previous experimentation and decided hey I think it would be friken awesome if I smoked some wile on mescaline!. that turned out to be one of the most true statements of my life. So heres the setting; its 2 in the A.M. and Ive been tripping since about 10 in the P.M. and I just finished watching the good the bad and the ugly (fucking unbelievably good movie on any substance) and now feel like I need another great experience to occupy my trip, and hey, hey, hey I got salvia! So the bowl gets loaded and off I go.

The beginning starts off a a standard trip, everything looks like a cartoon with that orange pinkish hue, I walk to put my bag and bowl away and theres that standard gravity which at this time feels like wind blowing hard in front of me. Then things start to change. The closest way I can really describe it is as if my mind split apart, into two different people, one on salvia and one on mescaline. The salvia me is just on salvia as it is, tripping pretty hard and with no real realization of where I am or what Im doing (classic salvia) but the other me, the mescaline me knew everything. He/I/we knew exactly where I was, what I was doing, and why I was doing it, and he/I/we kind of took a back seat and watched the salvia me with great amusement. It was the craziest thing I have ever experienced, both having no idea who I am or what Im doing and knowing exactly where I am and what Im doing along with watching myself being on salvia wile also experiencing salvia, but the two were not combined, they were separate experiences being experienced individuality but by the same person. This went on for about ten minutes and then it got crazier, the two of me began to remerge back into one of me.

At this point the mescaline side kind of stepped back into the salvia part of me so instead of that sudden realization I get when I do salvia, where I suddenly realize how things actually are and that everything I thought was wrong, I got these waves of understanding. Basically everything I know suddenly rushed back into me In an instant but only gave me a half second to process that before it came again, so I re-realized pretty much everything again, and then again, and again, in an almost never ending onslaught of wave after wave of pure knowledge. I would get hit with on of those waves, realize hey, I remember now Im on salvia and begin to laugh but I would only get out the first hahah- before hey, I remember now Im on salvia and I would re-start to laugh. Over and over again. I realized at one point that I must sound like Im choking which only exacerbated the cycle. Eventually (well it was probably only like 5 minutes I didnt look at a clock at this time) the waves slowed down to a trickle until finally stopping, leaving me with nothing more than a head full of mescaline, which was honestly the best way I could imagine to finish a salvia trip (usually they end with me feeling somewhat alone, and almost cold but this time I felt this warmth and like loving acceptance) and after taking about ten minutes to make sure that had actually happened I continued on my trip.

I had read another story of someone combining salvia with mescaline that seemed different but equally as crazy, they got sucked into another unrecognizable world for about 15 minutes. This would lead me to believe that when combining salvia with other hallucinogens all bets appear to be off, I would like to maybe get some more salvia and try it next time I do mushrooms or acid.</bodytext></report>
