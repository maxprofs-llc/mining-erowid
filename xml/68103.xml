I watched a show called 'scared weeds' about blue louts and figured I would give it a go. I purchased 1gr of 25x extract. I placed the brown powder into about 3oz of hot water. I let it sit for about 10 min, then drank the foul liquid. This was on a totally empty stomach with no other substances.

And....Nothing happened. Nothing at all. Clearly anyone whoever felt anything from this was either in combo with alcohol or cannabis and were probably just over analyzing the experience. I can honestly say that this plant did nothing for me.</bodytext></report>
