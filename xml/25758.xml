One night for the hell of it, I took a bunch of my anti-depressants (Celexa) because I was feeling very depressed and even suicidal at times.  My psychiatrist prescribes me 40mg of Celexa twice a day. I took seven 40mg pills, 280mg of Celexa.  This is where I messed up.

Not too long after I ingested the pills, I noticed lights getting brighter and my heart beating a little faster.  Before I knew it, I felt like I was having a severe panic attack.  Worse than any other ones I've ever had (I suffer from panic attacks and stress and take Klonopin for it).  Objects started looking strange, I couldn't think straight (confusion, disorientation), and I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin.  It was like abusing diphenhydramine at the 400mg - 600mg range.  It was not a happy, fun, or exciting experience at all.  It was terrible and I regret it even to this day.

I will never try this again and I extremely discourage anyone else from trying it.  The pills are for depression, not for having a good ol' time.  Take my word for it.  Peace.</bodytext></report>
