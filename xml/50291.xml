I've had a little 100mg bag of 2C-B-Fly sitting in my stash for a while now, and until last night, I had no real desire to try it.
/n
/n
About half way through a lazy Friday afternoon, I decided I wanted to give something new a try. I wasn't really in the mood for going out, so I figured I'd either go for some mushrooms or the Fly. I can't remember how I concluded that the 2C-B-Fly would be the better choice, but I'm glad I did.
/n
/n
Quick rundown of my previous drug use and experience - lots of weed, 2C-I, 2C-T-7, 2CB and mushrooms. I'd had a very nasty experience with 2C-I at 25mg about 5 weeks ago, although I had tried a low dose of 2C-B since then and had no problems at all. 
/n
/n
This was a solo trip, although I spent the latter part of it downstairs watching TV with one of my housemates.
/n
/n
At 7.30pm I carefully measured 15mg of 2C-B-Fly out and mixed it with water. I had eaten a fairly big meal 2 and half hours ago, although was feeling surprisingly hungry.
/n
Felt a bit of nausea after drinking it... the chemically bitter taste made me shudder, although I get that with all RCs.
/n
/n
+0.10 - Slight tingling sensation down my spine. Probably a placebo. 
/n
/n
+0.15 - Head feels strange - sensation of pressure on my forehead and neck. Goosebumps on arms despite it being very warm in the room.
/n
/n
+0.20 - Smoked a tiny bit of weed to relax.
/n
/n
+0.30 - First visuals spotted... only had a tiny bit of weed but it really accelerated this. CEVs colorful. Slight bending / warping and 'flickering' OEVs. Hard to look at the monitor - looks like it's flickering (like when you film a PC monitor) and is a lot brighter than normal. Watching simpsons and the sound is crystal clear. Marked pupil dilation. 
/n
/n
+0.45 - man this is really nice, screen is waving as I type, raining colorful snowflakes. feels like my head is warping round in a circle. Tracers linger beautifully. Soft psychedelic blur over everything... everything has rounded rainbow edges. Marked time dilation... this song has been going on for as long as I can remember. 
/n
/n
+1.00 - lava lamp shadow is dancing... really wavy screen, typing is very hard. Fingers feel strange pushing the keys - as if they aren't mine. Lovely bright, colorful visuals. Beautiful CEVs... like star rockets on a night sky, exploding with puffs of glitter. 
/n
/n
+1.30 - Real time dilation. Past 5 minutes seemed like at least half an hour. 
/n
/n
15mg is a real mind bender, couldn't go out anywhere like this. Walking is hard, but possible [Venturing downstairs to get a drink was harder than I thought it would be - I staggered there with a sort of drunken lethargy, almost fell against the wall a couple times].  
/n
+3.00 - Have been watching Simpsons the whole time. Haven't felt like typing anything. 
/n
/n
Really amazing visuals still. Seems to come in very quick waves of effects - really intense to quite manageable. 
/n
/n
[I read another 2C-B-Fly trip report and the author described it as constantly going from a ++ to +++ experience. I don't think I ever dropped lower than a +++, but there were times when I was really losing touch with reality, and 5 minutes later, I could be sitting there quite easily watching and understanding a simpsons episode.]

My log ended there - I think I just couldn't be bothered to write any more, plus typing was still damn near impossible at +3 hours. There were a few times when I was really panicking because I started to feel like I did on the bad 2C-I trip I had a while ago. There was nothing in my room to put me on my guard or make me feel like that - I brought it on myself by thinking about my ex-girlfriend. I jumped on the bed to try and calm myself down and realized my heart was really racing - I've never felt it beat so quickly. Not sure if that was down to me panicking, or the Fly... probably a combination. 
/n
/n
Overall, a very enjoyable experience, although at times a little overwhelming. I had planned for the trip to be an experiment with 2C-B-Fly so I could document the effects, although typing was so hard and the visuals were a little too intense to allow for much of that. 
/n
/n
I'd certainly try it again, although at a lower dose - probably 10mg. I'm not sure if I have a naturally low tolerance to phenethylamines or what, but they seem to effect me much more strongly than anyone I've ever tripped with. 
/n
/n
There was, however, one main negative side effects that I'd like to mention. I dosed at 7.30pm on Friday with what I thought was a pretty 'standard' 2C-B-Fly dosage. It's now 2pm on Saturday and I haven't slept, plus I'm still unable to sleep. Pupils are still dilated, although not to the extent they were last night.
/n
/n
I was up until about 5am because I just didn't feel like sleeping. Mentally I was really drained (I still am) and was developing a mild headache, but my body wasn't in the mood for rest. Any sensation of movement or pressure on my skin (particularly arms) 
/n
made my nerves tingle and instantly snapped me out of the process of falling asleep. 
/n
/n
I lay in bed all night (from 5am until 11am the next day) unable to sleep. When I closed my eyes, I could still see colorful fractals. 
/n
/n
I'd say in total the experience lasted a good 10 hours, with a plateau of about 3 and a half. The comedown was very gentle, with OEVs lingering until the 8 or 9 hour mark. 
/n
/n
I'd recommend having some sort of sedative close at hand, because the whole not being able to sleep thing is not cool. I wanted to reflect on the trip but I can't because I'm so tired. I finally got to sleep at 1am on Saturday night, woke up on the Sunday morning feeling refreshed and pretty much back to normal.
/n
/n
If I had to compare the Fly to another chemical, Id say its like a strong 2C-B trip (15mg of the Fly gave me visuals Id have to take at least 30mg of 2C-B to achieve), although very colorful like 2C-T-7. 
/n
/n
The body load was very pleasant  a sort of warming pressure around the side of my head and neck and a slight tingling in the stomach area. Id compare it to a low(ish) dose of mushrooms but without the cramps and nausea.</bodytext></report>
