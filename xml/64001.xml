After many times using wormwood I never found a 'sweet spot' until last night.

Around four pm I started the evening off by smoking 3 bowls of wormwood by myself. Things went as usual, the dream like feelings, pain relief and the pressure on the temples and forehead. About five PM I had smoked 3 more bowls with some people in my inner circle. We were waiting for someone to stop by and smoke some cannabis with us I had noticed that I was feeling really gone. I guess I would compare it to a low 2nd plateau of DXM because of the similarities but it was very different.

5:30 PM: The person got here and smoked 2 bowls with us. We all went to another person's house and continued to smoke. I noticed that the colors were blending and that my temples were feeling tingly almost numb. My face seemed to feel tighter and I was constantly laughing and talking.

6:30 PM After smoking I was back at my house playing a video game and chilling with my kitten Trip. Time passed very quickly almost too quick.

9:00 PM This was when the real fun started, I met up with some other friends outside in a ditch and smoked more cannabis. It was dark enough outside that I noticed the dots that I normally see at night. By this time I thought that the wormwood wasn't effecting me anymore. But little did I know it was waiting for the next high. After finishing smoking we stood there and talked for a while and I felt myself coming back up.

9:30 PM: I realised that I was tripping, the hallucinations were vivid. The stars in the sky danced around the sky as two other friends continued to talk. I remember saying that I was really tripping. My temples and forehead felt weird. I can't explain that feeling but it wasn't like the other times I had used wormwood. I noticed that I had the need to move. If I didn't move a lite anxiety would set in.

10:00 Pm: I closed my eyes and relaxed. The closed eye visuals were alot stronger then the open eye visuals. As the colors and shapes came together it relaxed me. There wasn't anything that stood out except after I opened my eyes the world spun with star like shapes.

10:30 Pm: I was playing around with my trip and it was fun. My mind felt very stimulated. I checked my pulse and my heart rate was about normal. We smoked the final bowl and continued to bullshit. I remember a friend of mine saying that the cannabis (Street grade) Was unusually good and he was super stoned.
/n
/n
11:00 Pm: I was back at my house, the hallucinations went away with the light leaving me back at that dream like state. I closed my eyes again, at that time I knew that I was coming down from the trip. My kitten was asleep so I decided to watch tv for a few hours.
/n
/n
12:00 PM: I wasn't high from the cannabis any longer but there was still a lite hint of a wormwood high, mostly pressure in the temples. I laid in bed until I fell asleep with the TV on, very unusual for me because I normally can't sleep with light or noise around me.

After many Wormwood experiences and a few that I have reported here I realised that Wormwood like all other psychoactives have a sweet spot for the effects. I am interested in trying larger doses still.

A few things I have learned about wormwood are: 
/n
/n
1. The effects are very strange. I believe that it effects more then one part of the brain. 
/n
/n
2. It is very mentally stimulating and there probably is a possable chance of having an anxiety attack given the right doses.
/n
/n
3. The trip is fairly easy to play around with visually but it is not intense. I find the visual effects simular to a low dose of LSD or a low dose of DXM.

4. I bit a hole in my lip because I couldn't feel it. I don't know when I did it but this is a sure sign of pain relief.

5. The effects are alot stronger when taken with cannabis. At first  you don't really feel alot. Mostly mental stimulation and pain relief with out it. Some tracers and color blending.</bodytext></report>
