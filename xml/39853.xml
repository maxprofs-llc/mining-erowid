I was first introduced to T7 this past Christmas.  At that time I was smoking marijuana habitually, but had not progressed to anything more potent or psychedelic.  A few of my friends had already expereinced this drug and were pleading with me to try it, they were so desperate for me to expereince what they had.  I agreed, and we all pooled are cash together and bought enough for three of us to trip.  I was the only one who would be doing it for the first time. Two friends would stay with us to be our 'sitters' and to drive us around.

Once we had taken our doses, with me taking the smallest dose since it was my first time, we set off in my friends SUV to smoke a joint or two.  We then went to the nearby park to take some gravitator hits.  I was very stoned as the T7 began to take effect after an hour or so, which my friends had recommended in order to avoid what they refer to as a 'head rush' or some sort of unpleasant feeling associated with T7 as the drug begins to take effect.

I first noticed that the visuals were beginning while we were parked at a gas station.  I was quite stoned as I mentioned earlier, and was gazing at a brick wall, when I became very aware through the effects of the marijuana that the bricks seemed to be melting and flowing together like heated wax.  From that moment, for all intents and purposes I had officially exited planet earth and was on my own private journey.  My entire reality had transformed in the blink of an eye into a work of art.  Traffic lights seemed to me to be the most beautiful things I had ever seen, that is, until I noticed nature.

We stopped at a park at my request and ventured into the trails.  It was around dusk and though quite cold, I felt very warm internally and could only gaze in wide-eyed wonder at the trees, whose branches seemed to twist and dance together, meeting and parting in a very defined rythem.  I perceived that the dead dry leaves on the forest floor began to hop like grasshoppers, rising vertically and switching places with their neighboring leaves.  The trunks of the oaks and pines bending and warped at a slower pace than the branches overhead, which now seemed to be twisting together and retacting very rapidly.

Sound became slower and softer, as though we were all whispering to each other, and it is highly likely that we were, so as not to disturb the harmonious dance going on around us.  We walked on slowly, huddled together, moving down towards the river.  The moon as it reflected off of the surface of the water, the soft whisper of the wind and the voices of my friends, the graceful movements of the forest around us, and the ever present sound of a crackling fire made for one of the most beautiful experiences of my life.  I wish only that I had access to some music at the time, for that would have made everything perfect.

This first experience, combined with several expereinces with T7 following this one, has led me to develop some personal guidelines:
/n
/n
1-Timing:  the best time to take the dosage is around noon or early afternoon, depending upon when I want to be able to sleep.  The bright light of the day is a bit overwhelming, so find something dark and soothing to do, like watching a movie that suits me.  Kids movies are pretty damn cool for this purpose, I have to admit.  Fantasia, Oz (with some Pink Floyd, if I so desire) or somehting like that.  Nothing too loud or violent.

2-Marijuana:  For me this element is essential.  It softens the mind and body for me and seems to make the transition into the trip much more pleasurable.  If I ever feel a bit nauseated or something, I spark a bowl.

3-Nature:  The most soothing place I find is outdoors or some other traquil setting.  Taking T7 and being out in nature in the spring or summer is an incredible expereince, completely unparalelled.</bodytext></report>
