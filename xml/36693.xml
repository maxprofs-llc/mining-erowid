I received my package on a Friday and was in a hurry to try it out.  None of my friends have had any experiences with 2C-I so all I knew was from the net.  I had not fasted and did not have the time for a full blown experiment that night so I decided to smoke some.

I do not have a scale so I eyed what I believe was 3-5 mg into a test tube that I torched and sucked the smoke up with a straw.  The taste is a lot like freebasing.  A burning plastic chemical taste.  I am sure some smoke was wasted in the process but here are the results.

Initially a light foggy visual, body high and slight confusion.  I thought that it would hit me hard and fast all at once but this was not the case at all.  A slow progressive experience of the same as the initial.  I never peaked, saw visuals nor did I have profound thoughts.  I went to the movies and saw Resident Evil: Apocalypse which is a fast paced visually stimulating movie anyway so I do not think that the 2C-I made much of a difference.  Within 1 hour I felt normal again without the 'Profound Enlightenment' that I had hoped for.

I returned from the movies and did the same again.  3-5 mg, in a tube smoked.  This was pleasant although still nothing tripendiculas.  I played on the computer, thought a bit and eventually went to bed where I had wonderful thoughts just prior to falling asleep that I only remembered in the morning.

Now this whole experience seems like a waste however, it was not.  It was a nice light way to work myself into bigger and better.  I relay this to those that want to try smoking it first or solo.  From what I have read and what I experienced I recommend that you save your stash for a real experience and take it orally.  I will relay my new experienced of oral when I do it till then I hope this helps.</bodytext></report>
