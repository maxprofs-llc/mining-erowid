I had a few garunteed hours of complete family free time with the house all to myself one day. Upon snooping for booze I came acrossed a bottle of elevil and decided to pop a few while I watched a movie (fear and loathign in las vegas, the perfect movie to watch while waiting for things to set in btw). Knowing me, I like to push things...I may have taken 3 tablets though I had meant to take only 2. I had also had about a cup of wine before I knew I would be taking them. After about 20 minutes to a half hour I had to lie down because I was sleepy. I assumed I had slept for the next day and a half but my family says I was up and about and even holding conversations that I can't recall. I'm scared to try these pills again but most likely will anyway since I assume I blacked out because of the alcohol.</bodytext></report>
