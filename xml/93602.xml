One day I decided to go out with some  friends, to a club. I had consumed a lot of alcohol, fast. I was feeling a bit shy, so when the opportunity arose I decided to take a key of ketamine, for the first time. At first I felt like the world was at my feet - for about 3 minutes. Then I started to feel queasy, so took a trip to the ol' toilets with a friend. I did not realise I was in a toilet but thought I was in a spinning like open white space. I. threw up. I curled in to ball, thought I was going to die, could not move and wept. I went home alone.</bodytext></report>
