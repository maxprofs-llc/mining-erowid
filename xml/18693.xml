We recieved a large shipment of half-fermented dried sceletium herb. I fermented it for 3 additional days in a plastic bag under the sun. I then proceeded to powder the herb. I prefer it under these circumstances. I've experimented with the product as it was when he sent it to us. I chewed several grams of it and felt no alteration of consciousness, although it did taste extremely good. I took my preperation and filled 2 '00' capsules. This got me very high.

When I stop taking the drug I will notice a change and my body will crave more. I have found insnuffilating powdered fermented kanna produces a nice stimulating effect.</bodytext></report>
