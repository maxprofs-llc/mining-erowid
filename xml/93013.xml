I sent for 1g phenazepam and a sample of 200mg methoxetamine aka MXE. I couldnt sleep because knowing an analogue of 1 of my top 3 drugs, ketamine will soon be in my hands. So I take a 30mg mirtazapine not thinking it could maybe ruin my MXE trip. Sleep. Wake up to my package.

Every morning I IV 2mg buprenorphine. This morning to potentiate the bupe I take about 30 to 40mg oral dose of phenazepam at noon. By 12:30 the bupe is coursing through me. Great rush. 
/n
/n
1:50 PM: I eyeball 25mg of MXE for insufflation. Bad burning in nasal cavities. 
/n
/n
2:00 PM: Feel euphoria, the speedy kind. Listening to dubstep and noticing dxm like music appreciation.
/n
/n
2:10 PM: Nothing psychedelic or dissociative. Feels like 10mg dl amphetamine salts. 
/n
/n
2:30 PM: Crazy dissapointed so I IM 20mg. Waiting. 
/n
/n
2:35 PM: Feel spaced yet relaxed like low dose methylone. nothing like ketamine.
/n
/n
2:45 PM: Trying to read bluelight.ru but strong urge to nod off. 
/n
/n
2:50 PM: take an additional 15mg IM. I want visuals and dissociation but between my girl and me the supply is depleating. Have that crap feeling one gets after eating a weak roll at a rave.
/n
/n
3:00 PM: Another 15mg IM. Total so far 75mg. Not looking promising.
/n
/n
3:15 PM: Pretty upset. A buzz. Nothing like K or dxm. This is a good vendor and never received a bad product.
/n
/n
3:15 PM: Got opiate like eye wiggles. I expected way more!
/n
/n
3:25 PM: 25mg IM more. Its all gone. My girl and I took 100mg each.

I would guess the benzo ruined it but my girl didnt take any phenaz and feels same as me. The only thing Im guessing is the mirtazapine ruined it. Well at least I have a ton of pharm grade benzo powder to play with.</bodytext></report>
