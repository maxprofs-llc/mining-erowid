I don't smoke much tobacco, and it may be that it is simply a Bad Drug.  But I've always enjoyed it combined with marijuana (spliffs).  I love the euphoria and clear, slowed-time meditation aspects of Kratom, and was hoping this would combine with the strange electric feeling and (left-brained?) focus I find tobacco imparts.  And, I haven't been able to find pot for ages.

I rolled a small tobacco cigarette with a few crushed leaves of kratom (mostly as filler; I understand it takes quite a bit to achieve anything in smoked form) and a tiny amount of 10x kratom powder (dipped the end of a chopstick into the bag).  This last was added only to the half of the cigarette (the far half).  It was a pleasant smoke.

Instantly regretted it as I heated up, started sweating, became dizzy and slightly nauseated, lost motor / tactile coordination, and got the shakes.  The effects have lasted for the better part of an hour, which I am weathering lying down.  I would sooner eat a pound of nag champa than try this again.</bodytext></report>
