I submit this just because searching the web for information about how to care stomach pain caused by abusive usage of ketamine is hard to find...

For myself and friends who are very very very very big users of ketamine the only things that can help stopping those stomach pain and urinary problems are:
/n
/n
- Drinking a lot of water to prevent dehydration and help urinary problems
/n
/n
- Hot baths for stomach pain can help
/n
/n
- Drinking hot water with sugar or with a little bit of baking soda
/n
/n
- Dycholium 300mg pills (Pills sold in drugstore) they really help me when this horrible stomach pain is coming. I'll take 1 or 2 and then 10-15 minutes after the pain is gone. Not working for everybody.

I wish this can help somebody somewhere because this kind of pain is really not fun and I know what I'm talking about....
