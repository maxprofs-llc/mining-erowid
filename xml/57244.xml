I tried taking Vinpocetine alone and I noticed mental clarity and some concentration enhancement. But, my heart rate is severely raised and my blood pressure is slightly higher. Before the Vinpocetine I was taking Ginkgo Biloba for quite some while around 4 months. And I liked the effects it was giving me. Better short term memory, better memory recall ect. All what ginkgo is famous for.

For some reason I pulled out Vinpocetine once again to give it a shot to see how it interacts with Ginkgo Biloba. And it works so much better combined then the two meds separate. The synergizing qualities between Ginkgo Biloba and Vinpocetine are really worth while. Vinpocetine combined with Ginkgo relieves my high blood pressure and high heart rate COMPLETELY. The memory recall, concentration, and, short term memory, is also enhanced with both medications combined.</bodytext></report>
