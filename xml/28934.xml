First, some pretext on how I made it.  I took about 50g of Mimosa Hostilis and 15g of Syrian Rue, and boiled it for one hour in a mixture of 70% Water 30% RealLemon juice and 750mg crushed Vitamin C and stirred often at a soft simmer (~95 F).  I then filtered the material through cheesecloth, and put the excess bark back in the pot along with a fresh mixture of Acidic solution.  Simmered for 45 minutes, filtered... then combined the two liquids.  The taste was absolutely horrid, but... bottoms up, myself and two others drank 200ml each and waited for the effects to kick in, which took about 25 minutes for me.  The other two threw up, but I have a fairly strong stomach and handled it.

Anyway... here's my trip summary.

It was pretty mild, because I'm not too great at making it (hey it was my first time!) -- However it was still awesome.  It was the first time I wasn't able to really control what I saw.  At the very beginning, I was sitting there, and there were these two 'elven' creatures (which is apparently common with DMT), which were really a mix between tadpoles, and elves -- they had tadpole lower halves (tails) and elven uper bodies.  There were flying in circles in my vision, forming a cross with the trails they left behind... it was a magnificent sight... it was as if they were 'painting the scene' for me.  This went on for a few minutes, then I turned off all lights and sat by myself in a room, with music playing softly -- I found that not focusing on anything really helps the trip, concentration is a major trip kill, for my trip anyways.  Throughout the trip, it felt like I was trying to break through the threshold of 'DMT Hyperspace' ... but I couldn't make it, I didn't have the power.  There were creatures everywhere laughing at me, because I could see them, but I couldn't experience their world... it was really depressing.

At one point, there was this octopus floating in front of me, but I couldn't touch it and it could not touch me, for there was an inpenetrable barrier of glass between us that extended off into infinite in all directions.  Nothing I could do would allow me to get on the other side of this 'wall.'  Anyways, I was sitting there, and everyhing went away and I was surrounded by total whiteness... then a shell appeared, it more resembled a nut now that I think about it.  I desperately wanted to know what was inside of it, but no matter what I did, no matter what I thought, it would not open.  Then, something remarkable happened, it began to unfold, and continued unfolding in every direction, trillions of times, filling my entire field of vision... all I could see was this shell unfolding -- Where the shell had been, there was now a great eye, looking right at me, curiously... it showed an interest in me, blinked a few times, and then the shell retracted and went back to its original state.  I think this creature was trying to show me how amazing the DMT world can be, and that I should experiment further, to experience the real world of DMT.  It seemed like, during this excursion, I was 'shown' the DMT world, but could not literally experience it.

I can't wait to get some pure DMT crystals to smoke... maybe the rocket will let me break through that damn glass. :)</bodytext></report>
