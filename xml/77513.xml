I smoked 10x salvia for the first time and wow, that stuff is mind-blowingly insane! I did not have any previous exposure to psychedelic compounds, but I did have two sitters present. I had smoked a couple bowls of Sence (some legal blend with synthetic compounds, and prolly maoi's judging by what it did to the salvia) prior to smoking the salvia.

30 seconds in, I felt the most insane vision twisting motion I have ever felt. 'Screenshots' of my entire field of vision were all turning left. A couple minutes later I fell off the chair, and that's when the trip really began.

From then on I was supposedly laughing my ass off. I was rolling around on the floor, knocking things over, and I had a strong feeling that everything was a dream. For a while I was thinking, 'I must be lucid dreaming'.

It then begun to occur to me that everything was in fact happening in real life, and I really was acting like a complete idiot. I started to think that 'everything is everything in everything'. I kept repeating this phrase throughout my trip to my sitters and tried to show practical examples to explain it better (a bunch of raspberries with raspberries surrounding it, blablabla). I felt like I had lived everything; I had lived everything that can possibly be lived.

Basically, the trip was insane. I do NOT want to smoke anything higher than 10x, because 10x alone was quite frightening. I can't imagine what a higher extract would be like.</bodytext></report>
