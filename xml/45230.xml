A few days after I bought them, I decided to do the shrooms, a decision made in the midst of a nitrous high, to be sure, but I'd been considering it earlier while sober. Wonderful!! It was so wonderful!! Oh my god. The most amazing thing ever, much much better than weed. Much much better than alcohol. Those things can't even compare. On those things I feel slightly different. On shrooms, my entire universe tilted and became a wondrous thing. I was so wonderfully out of it, and it was SO much fun. Unfortunately it started taking effect while I was upstairs eating dinner...

I had just done a little bit of nitrous, and while high on that, I decided that now was the time to eat the shrooms. I loved how they tasted. Like a nice beef mushroom stew. For about 45 minutes after that, I was doing various normal, day-to-day things. I was on the phone with my best friend, who sold me the shrooms, and I told him that I'd eaten the shrooms, and he told me to drink plenty of water. I went upstairs and asked my mom for pea soup, so she put it on the stove to warm up. She made me a salad in the meantime, so I sat at the table and began eating the salad, and read Time magazine. My friend had told me on the phone that it takes about 40 minutes to start having an effect, and it was about 40 minutes later that I was nibbling my salad. I was reading Time magazine, and then I noticed that I seemed to be very close to the pages. Either that or they were bigger, as though I were leaning in closer to them. Yet I wasn't. I glanced back at my salad, and it was an amazingly vibrant shade of green. I was quite surprised. I thought perhaps I was a bit tired, because sometimes I can experience things like that. I didn't think the shrooms could have an effect yet.

Because I had drunk a liter of water in my room from my water bottle, I had to go to the bathroom, and I thought I should get away from the table. So I went, and in the dim light I looked at the wood grain of the door. Then it started to become 3D. The curves of the wood grain became 3D bulges. I was more surprised, and thought it was a trick of the dim light, since I've had things like that as well. I thought the effects must only just be starting, to be so faint. Then I saw neon red-blue diamond/quadrangle shapes flashing on the floor, and on the texture of the towel, and I just stared at them, still wondering if it weren't just some trick of the light.

I returned to the table, and my salad tasted amazingly good. I had never tasted a salad so good before. I started feeling cozy and snuggly in my sweater, and I curled up on the kitchen chair and went back to Time magazine. My fingers looked really short somehow, and the paper felt weird under my fingers. In fact, my entire awareness of my body, where it was and what it was touching, became odd. It seemed to be taking forever for me to finish my salad, and I vaguely remembered the pea soup that was on the stove. It took ages, but eventually I finished the salad and Mom gave me the pea soup. It was the absolute BEST pea soup I've ever had. It tasted so incredibly good, I just drank it straight. In fact, I began to wonder if drinking pea soup from a bowl were a normal thing to do, and I put it down for fear of drawing attention to myself. But it was almost all gone by that point anyway, and after a few ineffectual scrapes of the spoon, I picked it up and drank the rest. Then I noticed that I'd been staring at the same page of Time this entire time (15 minutes perhaps?), and I quickly began flicking through pages to make a semblance of making progress.

My 7.5-year-old brother was reading a picture book about deer, and he kept bantering on and on about it. I got really giggly. I kept quiet at first; Mom was at the end of the table reading Vanity Fair. My brother kept bantering and giggling, and I felt incredibly giggly; it was so funny I could almost feel actual waves of humor and laughter as physical things inside my body. It was very strong and intense; I started giggling. Then I was shocked at myself, because I must have sounded strange. My brother heard my giggling and that encouraged him, and we escalated each other. Mom gave me a strange look. I had to bite my tongue and cheek to keep from bursting out laughing, it was so funny. At the humor of it all. My brother's grin and the deer book felt so good. I decided to retreat to the bathroom once more before I got myself into any real trouble.

This time, my fingers seemed positively tiny, and I tried to better examine my hand. I waved it a bit in front of my face and then the wonderful clich thing happened, I saw tracers. I think my jaw actually dropped. I just waved my hand some more, and saw smears of my hand going all over my vision, covering up the bathroom, the sink, the floor, the walls and door. I could paint my hand everywhere. I just stared at it, and it slowly faded away. Somehow this calmed me down, at least so that I wasn't about to burst out giggling again. I thought wow, this is so cool, unlike anything else. I re-entered the kitchen.

I got a bit more pea soup, and once again, it tasted great, salty and everything. After I finished it, I realized there was no other reason to stay upstairs, and despite the intense fun I was having looking at the pictures in the Time magazine, I thought it best that I sneak back down to my room before I got into any serious trouble. I put my bowl in the sink, which looked odd with its stacks of dishes, and went down to my room. This must have been around 6:15 or so. I thought, could it still be getting more intense? And it was. You know how, above a stove, the air shimmers because of the different densities? That's what happened next, over my entire vision. Except moreso. Extremely moreso. I looked up at the stars on my ceiling, and they waved around.

6:15 p.m. to around 7:30 p.m. (I stopped watching the clock) So I spent a long while having fun in my room watching the iTunes visualizer and listening to music with it. Then I took the last two nitrous chargers. What happened then was as inexplicable as a dream. For ten minutes or so I was taken out of this universe and put into another. I was in a completely different place, as strange as a dream's warped conception of the world, and yet I was nearly fully conscious. When I gradually faded back into my bedroom, I found myself kneeling on the floor by my bed, leaning over the blankets. They felt so good and soft on my skin that I started just rolling around on my bed. An interesting effect of the shrooms was that, like a psychic, I could predict what I was going to do, and even what I was going to think. So I was rolling around on the bed, and I realized that I was going to think I looked ridiculous doing that, do a mockery of it, and then stop. I never told my body to mock the movements and then stop. I just watched it do this after I knew that it would. I got thirsty, even after drinking two bottles of water and more from the tap, so I went to the basement fridge to get a can of ginger ale. I added a capful of Bacardi 151 to it just for kicks.

Eventually Mom called me back upstairs. I waited fifteen minutes, gathering my wits, and then went. She was showing me my new Kaiser health insurance information that I'd just received in the mail. I was careful not to look directly at her, and to try to avoid letting anyone see my eyes in general, due to the dilating of the pupils. Of course, Mom found something else wrong with me. She said in a low voice that she could smell something-something-amaldehyde on my breath. I asked her what that was. She said it was the product of alcohol once it's been digested. Then she asked me if I felt so worried and tense about my upcoming study abroad trip to Paris that I had to drink by myself. I said something about how my best friend was going to be coming over soon. She lectured me on drinking for a while, and I said it was only a capful in a can of ginger ale and that I couldn't feel any effects from it at all (which was true). In order to escape, I said I wanted more pea soup. Mom said the only pea soup left was the watery one from last week, which was in a jar in the fridge, so I went down to my room to get my Introduction to French Poetry book to read while eating. I couldn't concentrate, though, and I sat at the kitchen table staring at the picture at the beginning of one of the chapters for about ten minutes, before remembering that I was supposed to be having more pea soup.

I opened the fridge and was proud of myself for finding the jar of pea soup so quickly in such a confusing space. I got a bowl and a spoon, and poured the contents of the jar into the bowl (wondering, as I did, if that were something I would normally do). It seemed a bit chunky. Earlier that same day, at Grandma's, I'd poured a cup of milk that had been left out, and it had been chunky and smelled horrible. So I was worried that the pea soup might be rotten as well. I smelled it very carefully and examined it. It smelled all right, but there was a strange purple veiny thing in it which turned brown sometimes. The soup wasn't opaque like normal pea soup either, but I attributed that to the fact that it was the watery batch. I put it in the microwave and went back to the French poetry book, enjoying the nice visuals that kept popping up to accompany the poems. Eventually my little brother opened the microwave door and told me that my soup must be really cold by now, so I got it and took it back to the table.

Mom joined me at the table, still with her Vanity Fair. I started eating the soup, and though it tasted good, it was strange. I commented to Mom that this didn't taste very much like pea soup. She just stared at me for a moment, then said 'that's not pea soup. That's chicken soup.' I looked down at the soup, and it looked green like pea soup, but then the colors shifted and I saw that it was indeed a golden tan chicken broth. It reverted to a pea soup appearance before I looked up at Mom again. I asked her where the watery pea soup was, and she said it was in the fridge in a jar. I told her I thought I'd taken the jar of pea soup. She said 'I can't understand how the hell you could mistake chicken soup for pea soup.' I finished the bowl, and while watching me carefully, she added, 'You know, you're pretty good at pretending that you're normal.' I hoped desperately that she was referring to the alcohol, and I fled to my room.

Back in the safety of my private lair, with the door securely shut and locked, I amused myself by pretending I was a wizard. I could wiggle my fingers and things and make them move or wiggle around. I had the power of telekinesis. The next few hours were just fun on the computer chatting with friends and watching the iTunes visualizer. All in all, it was amazingly fun except for a pain in my stomach during the tense moments upstairs with Mom. My best friend came over to my house just as I was beginning to come down (around 12:30 a.m.), and we discussed our experiences.</bodytext></report>
