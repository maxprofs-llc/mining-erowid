Abilify is generally the second anti-psychotic recommended by the mindless pill-dispensers. Restlessness is the main side effect. I reduce my illness down to the fact that if I am comfortable eating and sleeping I will not have an episode. With this precaution, I have been able to experiment with Abilify for one month at each of the subsequent doses: 0, 5, 10, 15

At 0mg of anti-psychotic medication my eating and sleeping habits were sporadic. There was little consciousness of a need to maintain healthy habits and an inability to sleep more than 6 hours at a time along with an inability to fall back asleep.

At 5mg eating and sleeping habits entered my frame of reference and I felt a distinct responsibility to take care of myself

At 10mg I slept and ate the same amount as at 5mg, but worried constantly about my lack of ability to control my diet and sleeping habits.

At 15mg I always caught up on missed sleep and needed a full day's worth of food almost every day, at some point in the day. No more worries.

Starting 20mg and this is where the restlessness becomes a difficulty. I have an easier time playing with the limits of food and sleep but have a short tether for such play.</bodytext></report>
