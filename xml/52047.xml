I am in my late 40s.  I was a heavy user of cannabis (and everything else I could get my hands on)when in my teens - but I gave it all up when I was 21 due to some heavy psychological problems I had (I realise now induced by grief at the loss of a family member). I revisited cannabis about three years ago and have become a regular but very controlled user.  I say controlled because I use it in small doses almost medicinally. I find it gives me far greater empathy for people than I have usually and my relationships have improved a lot since I began using cannabis again.  However, I was concerned about some side effects: memory loss and less mental agility.

I read comments online about melatonin and its assistance in dealing with these side effects and so I thought I would try it out. I have now been taking it each night for about a month.  It certainly helps with sleep and has assisted me with mental agility which is all I really wanted.

However, there have been some quite dramatic unforeseen benefits. I have found that I have a new much more positive attitude.  Often when I first smoke weed, I feel feelings of anxiety, fear and paranoia.  Although unpleasant, I endure these feelings because I know they will pass and I will get into that more relaxed and peaceful state. Lately, however, far from having any paranoid thoughts after I have just smoked, I have felt very good about myself and even shall I say full of myself a kind of celebration at being me!  These same good feelings continue whether stoned on cannabis or not.

I can actually record the beginning of this positive experience as an epiphany which occurred after a nightmarish dream.  I wont go into detail but lets say I encountered some demons which I was able to dismiss as phantoms (and Im not a religious person). It was scary dream but carried with it a message that came to me as I reflected on it in the days that followed. I know it has changed my consciousness  almost like an exorcism.

If I smoke some weed about the same time as taking the melatonin and then go to bed and close my eyes, I will be transported into a very hallucinogenic state which for me was panic free and the closest thing to absolute bliss that I have ever experienced  almost a back to the womb experience  I kid you not!

As I write this (not under the influence of weed) I feel a sort of warmth running through me. I hope it will continue because at the moment I feel the happiest I have felt for many years. Whether its a combination of both substances I dont know  but I felt compelled to share my experience because I really believe that with a little tweaking I can find the right chemical balance for my brain. I also think that tweaking can be achieved by other means such as meditation which I intend to explore - because ultimately I would prefer to find that balance in a drug free way.</bodytext></report>
