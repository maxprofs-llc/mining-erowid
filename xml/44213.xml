I recently bought a passion flower vine from my local garden store. I have been looking for a legal high for some time and had discovered passion flower. The previous day I had eaten some of the stems of the plant and noticed a mood change. I was very happy and smilling a lot. I would contribute that to placebo however I wasn't expecting any effects from the amount I ingested. I was just tasting the plant to see if it would be palatable. The next day I tried a dose that I expected to feel.

I boild a cup of water and poured it over 4-5 cut up leaves (2-3 grams) and let it steep for 20 min. After I strained out the leaves I then squeezed the remaining liquid from them.  While the tea cooled I ate the boiled leaves. They taste horrible so I rolled them into little balls and swallowed them with water like a pill. The tea tasted ok but not good so I drank it in a few large gulps. I took my mind off it and started doing other things.

About a half our later I picked some fresh leaves and stem parts and ate them, about 2-3 grams. About 15 min. later I started to notice a heavy feeling in my body. I then went to the mall and movies with my friend. For about 1.5-2 hours I felt mildly euphoric, very relaxed. There was also the slightest hint of a weed buzz.

My take on the whole experience: not what I was hoping for (being high) but definately a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I do think that the effects were too strong to be just a placebo effect but I could be wrong. I will definately do this again (probably more concentrated) and I would also like to try smoking it some time to see if its effects are different. I'm not sure how to make an extraction of it but a high concentration liquid or powder would be great.</bodytext></report>
