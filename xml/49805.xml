YEAAAAAAAAAH!!!! What is happening here is the actual start of the new era in human kind, I and everyone at the conference and in Basel generally felt the intense strong vibe of total insight, peace, harmony, everything that shows us the true soul of mankind. While I didnt even had a single mg of acid in my body, I was trippin good, I saw crazy cool things everywhere, because of the good vibrations.

Basel is the first totally enlightenend city of the world, its like there is a a dome over it that will continue tot grow like a huge mushroom. Even people I know back from highschool that weren't on the congress are getting into psychedelics, even though I never ever exspected them to.

For me, it is the total live experience, something totally special what never happened before in this world. so the conclusion is it totally kicks ass and so will the world in a moment. Just flow to it, the balance is there; we dont even have to fight for it, thats something the hippies and the 90s-ravers already did for us. I can keep talking forever, but I wont because you'll already understand me ;p
