I've tried a lot of different drugs in my time, but the one I just can't let go of is pot. I would consider myself a fairly experienced drug user. I've done my share of meth, coke, ecstasy, acid, shrooms, opium, a variety of rx pills (xanax, valium, elavil, ritalin, aderral, oxycodone, etc., you get the picture.) I'm not addicted to any one drug, but you might say I'm on my way.

The first 'drug' I ever did was huff gasoline when I was about 10 years old. I liked it and did it several times that summer. I was very naive and had no idea the dangers of inhalants like that. Then when I was about 14, I tried pot and I fell in love with it after the first time. I just loved the way it made me so happy, so relaxed and giggly, food tasted absolutely amazing, (the munchies have always been one of my favorite things about weed, and when I have the munchies I NEVER get full. It's kind of scary how much food I can hold.) It was just plain FUN.

Now I smoke weed every day. I've been smoking every day for about a year and a half. Before that it was a few times a week. If I run out and can't get any right away, I start to get antsy, irritable, etc. I have to almost force myself to eat if I have't smoked any weed to get the munchies. I also tend to get constipated if i don't smoke some each day. Something weird happens when i smoke: after about the second or third hit, when i start to feel it coming on good, I have to go shit. My mom had a crack addiction years ago, and she said that every time she smoked rock, she would have to shit. I also know someone who takes ecstasy at least every weekend, sometimes 2 or 3 times a week (she has done it as frequently as every day) and everytime she takes a roll, before she starts to come up she has to do the same.

I know reefer isn't addictive, but I do have a mental dependence on it. I I ever run out, I feel like I'm doing time until I get another sack. And I'm never out of weed for more than a day. The thing is though, I've binged heavily on coke, crystal, and crack, and yes I've had cravings when it's gone, but nothing, NOTHING satisfies me like weed. I couldn't imagine facing a day without weed. Maybe one day, MAYBE two... but no more.

I do other drugs often, (2-5 times a week usually) it's like they just fall into my lap. I LOVE all drugs, and I love the way some of them make me feel better than weed, like acid or XTC, but I can live without all those other drugs. Yeah, they're fun, but I don't feel like I *need* them. I do feel like I need weed though.

I know this is probably not mentally healthy but I've noticed no bad physical effects. I think most people will agree with me that weed is probably the least dangerous thing I could have a dependence on, and be doing daily. I certainly would be in worse shape if I had to have coke or speed every day. The thing that is kind of scary to me though, is that I am only 17 years old. I have my whole life ahead of me, and do you know what I see in almost every single day for the rest of my life? Not coke, not crystal, but weed. Yes, I know for sure that I could stop smoking weed (or using any drugs for that matter) FOREVER if I wanted to. The thing is, I don't want to. Ever.</bodytext></report>
