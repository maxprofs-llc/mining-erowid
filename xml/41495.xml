Experience:  I've used Heroin around twenty times. As far as other Opiates/Opioids and Opiate-like drugs, I have tried Poppy tea, Opium, Codeine, Morphine, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Hydromorphone, Propoxyphene, Methadone, Tramadol, and Kratom..

Method of dosing: Nasal, IV

Medications: None

To start out, I have been using Opiates/Opioids since I was around 14yrs. old (I am 20 now).  Over the years, Poppy tea, Opium, Codeine, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, and Kratom have become my favorites.  I never let myself enjoy Heroin the first few times I used it, and I kept saying, 'I like Oxycodone better, it feels cleaner, and it's just a better drug overall.'  All of this was just a lie I told myself for quite some time because I was afraid to love Heroin.

However, I eventually got some really high quality stuff, and I was in a place in my life that I felt comfortable enough to embrace the warmth of a Heroin high.  I dove right into the waves.  To be honest, I never seen it as 'chasing after the first high.'  It actually seemed as if each line/shot was getting better and better.  The second day of a binge was better than the first, and the third was better than the second.

Every time I dosed, it seemed as if I was at the ocean.  At first, the waves came on gently, slowly reaching an awesome power, then subsiding again.  Every time I did a line/shot, the waves swept me away into a swirl of wonderful dreams filled with life, color, and beauty.

The actual feeling of being on it was like that of curling up into a warm blanket with a cup of hot chocolate after being out in the cold of a snowy winter.  There is a defined warmth with Heroin that differs from other Opiates.  There is a sedation that seems to be perfect, as it never causes me to crave sleep, but it gives me a very pleasant nod.  The euphoria of Heroin far surpasses that of any other Opiate/Opioid.

Music is quite enhanced while being swept up in the wave.  I feel really into the sound as well as quite motivated by my enhanced creativity to write music, both lyrically (poetry mostly) and on guitar.  The only Opiates/Opioids or Opiate-like drugs that have ever caused this enhancement of music enough to mention as an extremely positive effect of the drug are Heroin and Kratom.

Perhaps one of the best feelings is actually the absence of feelings.  There is a complete emotional, psychological, and physical numbness that I get with Heroin.  I don't have a care in the world, and there isn't one damn thing that could ever bother me.  It is a complete temporary escape from all pain.

All of the effects of a Heroin high seem to be enhanced by Cannabis as well.  I don't get the complete effect from Heroin unless I combine it with Cannabis.  The most prominent of these effects are the dreams and visual effects I get at the end of the high.  When I start to nod, I get these dream scenarios going on in my head whether I have my eyes open or closed.  They are always very beautiful and dreamy.  I also get mild visuals that seem much more real than Cannabis visuals alone.

Aside from the feeling, I wanted to share some of my notes on the differing effects of three routes of administration.  I have used Heroin orally, intranasally, and intravenously. 
/n

I have only used Heroin once orally.  I had a batch of extremely potent Heroin, and I messured out 80mgs on a scale accurate to 0.001g (1mg).  I put the powder in a capsule and swallowed it.  After about 30 minutes I began to feel the warmth come over me in a very calm way.  It did not provide any type of rush like other routes of administration do, but it did seem like it may be a positive way for Heroin addicts to ween themself off if they wish to quit using or just taper down.  It's quite difficult to ween yourself with intranasal or IV administration because of the rush let alone with a completely different drug that you aren't quite used to such as Methadone.  Anyhow, I don't have many more notes on oral Heroin as I interupted the high with a shot.  However, it was worthwhile to me, and I let the high go for a couple hours until I did my shot.

Next is intranasal administration.  This is my favorite way of using Heroin for a few reasons.  One, I love insufflating drugs.  I have grown to love the taste of Heroin going into my nose and then the drip.  Intranasal Heroin gives me a nice rush about 3-5 minutes after insufflating it.  The intense part of the high contiues to climb and fall over a period of two to three hours, but unlike other Opiates/Opioids such as Oxycodone, I don't feel irritated or uncomfortable in any way after the effects wear off.  I just feel very calm, relaxed, and mildly euphoric for the rest of the night.  Redosing is always very positive for me.  I love feeling the waves come back over me again, and in a way, I like the calm waves of redosing better than the rush after the first line.  The euphoria and dreams seem to run much deeper the longer you are on it.

Last is intravenous administration.  IV Heroin is extremely intense, though I have never grown as fond of it as many have.  As opposed to insufflation, I do not like using needles.  They don't bother me, but I don't have an addiction to the needle like many addicts do, but rather, I have an addiction to the things associated with insufflating drugs.  However, IV Heroin is a very powerful way of using the drug.  The rush starts at about 3-5 seconds after the shot.  The feeling is overwhelming, and it usually leaves me confined to the place where I am sitting/laying.  My vision becomes quite blurred, and I find it difficult to be very social like I am with intranasal administration.  The effects seem to climb and fall after the rush similar to insufflated Heroin.  It is only a once in a while thing for me to use IV Heroin, as I find it somewhat uncomfortable.  It is hard for me to judge a dose.  I either get too little or too much.

In conclusion, Heroin is a drug that many people have a love/hate relationship with.  I have heard it all, but nothing compares to experiencing it for myself.  Heroin is both good and evil, Angel and Demon.  In this report, I swayed much toward the loving effects of Heroin but lets not forget that Heroin is an extremely addictive substance, and it should be used with much caution and responsibility.  I have experienced moderate withdrawals from plenty of Opiates/Opioids including Heroin, and they are not fun.  Luckily, I have an unusual amount of self control, and though I do have a problem with addiction, I know I can quit at any time.  Many people can't.</bodytext></report>
