I was exploring in my grandparent's basement looking for pills when I happened upon a bottle marked chloroform. Despite the warning that inhalation was extremely dangerous and caused cancer I brought the bottle up to my room looking forward to a new high. I tipped it bottle over onto a washcloth once and brought it too my face, inhaling through my mouth a few times.

I started to feel a little numb and funny so I stopped and the high quickly intesified into a nitrous like buzz. I felt extrememly numb and relaxed, and my whole body was buzzing like crazy. I also saw mild visuals, and sounds were echoing. The high overall was very similar to nitrous, but it lasted for about five minutes instead of thirty seconds.</bodytext></report>
