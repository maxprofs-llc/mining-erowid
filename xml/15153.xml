I've only used drugs for about a year now. Weed, opium, dxm, lsa, ritalin; gasoline has been my favorite.

Anyway, my first experience was in my garage, I would take the gas can, hold it to my mouth and inhale.  After a minute or two, I would hear every sound echoing, then I would begin to make out robotic, high pitched voices out of rustling leaves.  For some reason in every inhalent experience I have, my paranoia comes out in the form of extremely realistic hallucinations. My mother, for example, would come to the door of our garage and peek in, and on a couple of occasions, I would throw the gas bottle down, spilling it, only to realize my mom wasn't there.

Once I hallucinated a queen/fairy stepping down the stairs behind me, saying 'I have arrived, my royal duty is to crown you king'  very strange almost deja vu-ish feelings.  Somehow, I felt like I knew this queen, or that I had met her, somewhere sometime, in a dream far away.  When I was 5 or 6, I remember playing in my garage, and I almost wonder if I had accidentally inhaled gasoline fumes then, and met this queen in a trip long ago.

Sometimes, if I would inhale too much gas, I would enter a strange world, almost cartoonic, where bright orange and yellow creatures would play tricks and pranks on each other. Somehow, I would ALWAYS have a feeling of permanentness, not that I would be permanently in this hallucinigenic state, but how long the universe has been in existance, and if my life was real, or if it was a dream.  One time I entered this world, and all of a sudden snapped out of it, feeling scared it would have been permanent.

After a few trips, I would begin to have hallucinations inside my body; that I could feel. It felt as if there was an air bubble running through by bloodstream, and that my heart was beginning to turn inside out. This freaked me out, and I stopped huffing.</bodytext></report>
