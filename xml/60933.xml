Diphenhydramine in my opinion is a truly beautiful substance when taken in moderation. I often used to hear about train wrecks and horror stories involving the drug so when I first decided to give it a try I made sure that I was taking a very small dose in comparison to what many say is the norm.

When I first took the substance I started off with only 100MG's barely if at all over the recommended dose. I felt the effects very lightly and decided that next time I would up the dose.

A few days later I bump the dose up to 200MGs and I can safely say that I have found my groove. The buzz that was produced with such a small amount was beautiful. I became very, very relaxed. I found that things on TV and conversations with friends became a lot more funny to me. Not to the point where everything was hysterical and I found myself giggling like a complete fool but just to a point where it was alot easier to appreciate the humor and laugh. Everything became a lot more interesting as well and overall I had a great feeling of well being.

I was in control the entire time but my mind WAS altered. Just enough to where it was enjoyable.

Since then I've always used the substance at around that dosage and always had an enjoyable experience. I've even found that using  it about an hour or 2 before sex allows be much greater stamina in terms of controlling climax and when I do reach that point it produces a bit of a drawn out longer orgasm. Imagine an Orgasm in slow motion and thats what you get.</bodytext></report>
