First off I should say that I have been quite familiar with both substances in question for some time before this combination. I first discovered my love of opiate drugs with a script of 7.5/500 Lortabs I received after having my wisdom teeth removed. I was told by friends that Carisoprodol was an interesting experience a couple years later. On their own both substances are very enjoyable but very different. Hydrocodone seems to give more of a euphoric 'head high' while Soma leaves your mind intact but makes your entire body relax, one friend of mine describes the Soma experience as having every muscle in your body pleasantly melting off your bones. I began to hear from people that I had not even truly felt what these substances could do until I combined them, needless to say my curiosity was piqued.

I began asking around to see what most people recommended dose wise for this mix and almost everyone who had ever done it said four Lortab 10/650s and three Somas, each of which was roughly what I normally took when I would use them separate. After looking around for a while a friend of mine finally came through with a connection. He was interested in trying out this new mixture so we each purchased the pre-determined dose plus a few extra Lortabs for a few buddies that we knew would like a tab or two.

Since I had just eaten about an hour before, we waited another hour before dropping the pills. Call me crazy but I like taking any oral drug on an empty stomach, this causes some discomfort in some people though. We each ate our seven pills with lots of water as each one of those is around the size of a damn dime! We decided to head over to another friends house to give him the tabs we picked up for him. Now I had really just expected a nice mix of two familiar feelings maybe slightly more intense than alone, but that is not what I got at all. About half way over to the guys house and about 30 minutes after dropping I started to get the basic Lortab feel, happy, slightly itchy, and the floating head. But about 3 minutes later when we arrived I was thrown into something completely different altogether.

The euphoria was still there only intensified by an immeasurable amount. I only wanted to sit there and listen to music, I did not really feel like moving at all but as we had just arrived at our friends house I had to go inside. We walked up the stairs to his room and the first thing I did was grab my favorite chair, this big round wicker chair with a massive soft cushion that just swallows you up. There were some other people over there, one in particular that I don't care for too much. Normally I would have been kind of pissed at him because he would just start talking to me about his depressing problems, and I think he did then, but I just didn't care about him, his problems, my problems or anyone's for that matter. Nothing at all mattered, It was like being inside some kind of sound proof bomb shelter completely isolated from the rest of the world.

My memory gets a little fuzzy at this point but I don't think it was because of the substances themselves, I think I just wasn't interested in anything else that was going on around me with the exception of music, as that is the only thing I can clearly remember is what music I was listening to and how beautiful I though it was. My memory gets better a couple hours later while we were at a different friends house, but at this point I noticed something else that I found quite humorous at the time, my eyes would not focus one bit unless I struggled to keep them locked on something. Even still after about five seconds I would catch my eyes going crossed and then closing with my head nodding off, it was actually the most relaxed feeling I had ever had. I figured talking might help bring me out of that mode for a while and that's when I remembered that my friend had taken exactly what I took so we started talking about the whole experience so far. He told me that he had been having the same problems with trying to keep his eyes focused and his head up and awake. We laughed about this for a while and then went off to the kitchen for a little food. Later that night when I went back to my place, I sat in my room, smoked a little bit of a kind nug I had and fell asleep listening to some music, it was perhaps one of the best nights of sleep I have ever had.

The next day I was a little slow early on but I came out of it by mid-afternoon. This was by far the most intense experience I had ever had with an opiate drug, and longest lasting (about 8 hours). The feeling could never be totally put into words. I can definitely see an increased potential for addiction when combining these drugs so one should exercise caution and whatever you do don't even think of throwing something else into the combination, especially any kind of depressant. I haven't tried this again, although I would like to some time in the future, but for now the occasional hydrocodone experience every three or four weeks is just fine.</bodytext></report>
