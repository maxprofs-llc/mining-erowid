I have experimented with auditory frequencies in the past and have found them to be useful for getting over 'morning fog' the headspace I encounter on lack of sleep. I have read that the Hz setting I use, or low end 'theta' entrained waves, help to regulate sodium/potassium levels much like good old sleep. I find that it clears the head in any case. I just downloaded Brett Logans WinAural program, yeah freeware, and have been using the beatwaves for the last couple days on and off.

Today: began listening about an hour after waking. I was a little groggy from surfing all night on the web. A few seconds after putting on the headphones I began to feel calm and sedately refreshed. I like to listen to music while I use the beatwaves so I run media player and turn the waves down low to barely perceptible. Extended moderate sound level listening can cause the wah-wah effect in the ears akin to rapidly covering and uncovering the ears while listening to loud music. As of about an hour and a half of listening I feel calm, and meditative. My mood is slightly elevated. As a comparison I would say one strong beer's worth of euphoria without any feeling of being on something. A crystal clear state like waking up to a beautiful day after an excellent nights sleep.

Just to note: When I use the beatwaves while playing 1st or 3rd person games If the character falls from a great height I get a feeling akin to being on a rollercoaster. I think this might have to do with inducing a dreamlike brainwave. I find myself more impressionable when asleep and dreaming. Also movies are a little harder to follow but seem more intense while listening to theta waves.

I hope this is interesting, for those who know about binaural beats, no, I have not experienced OBE because of it, but that doesn't mean you won't! ,)</bodytext></report>
