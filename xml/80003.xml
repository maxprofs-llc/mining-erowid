Description of subject, the writer.
/n
/n
Subject: Male, age 30'ish, weight 80kg, height 1.78cm
/n
Health:  Good physical health, hayfever, asthma.
/n
Mental:  Diagnosed ADHD-PI
/n
Medication taken two days earlier: 100mg valium, 8mg xanax.
/n
Medication taken same day: 10mg Lexapro, bronchodilator, antihistamine.
/n
/n
Harm-reduction disclaimer
/n
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/n
I felt obliged to note the excessive intake of valium and xanax I took two days earlier since half-life of benzos can be quite long and I don't know if it affects MDPV.
/n
/n
Now for the MDPV, this is really important to take note of. I have read lots of reports of inability to stop redosing MDPV, fiendish! Be warned that this seems to be the standard with MDPV and a harsh come-down.
/n
/n
However I did not at any time feel any urge to redose at any time after initial dose. Neither did I experience any comedown or crash, instead just such a slow comedown to baseline I didn't notice it. Whether it was depending on the combination of Lexapro, my mood and mindset or setting, further trials will tell if any.
/n
/n
==============================================================================
/n
/n
Description of situation before intake of substance:
/n
/n
Mindset: Just home from weekend at countryside house. Peaceful and curious.
/n
Setting: Home alone. I have had a full nights sleep and fully rested, and in a neutral mood and had a medium meal at 15 o clock.
/n
/n
-------------------------------------------
/n
/n
The text is written in real-time, and I tried to edit as little as possible to show the change of mind and whatever. However I had to edit away rather large stories as my mind wandered to other things in this same document as sleepyness and focus on the report was lost.
/n
/n
Description of the substance
/n
----------------------------
/n
Container is ca 3x2 inch ziplock brand RIPPIE, with a white label. Label has black text MPDV 500mg left side, and to right black square marking with three smaller squares upper left, lower left, upper right.
/n
/n
The contents are a white salt, a bit chunky. Smells faintly citrus. Taste is chemical but not nasty. It solves in water with some effort. Snorting it is painless.
/n
/n
Description and timeline of the MDPV
/n
------------------------------------
/n
/n
18.00  	30mg of MDPV is taken nasal and 30mg MDPV orally solved in water.
/n
	Unknown amount of snuff tobacco is consumed.
/n
/n
18:05 	Non-placebo obscure active substance in bloodstream.
/n
/n
18:15 	A weak stimulating body and head buzz.
/n
/n
18:30 	Negatives:
/n
	Minor jaw-tension. 
/n
	Involuntary movement of tounge and lips when not focusing.
/n
	This would be a chewing gum moment in social setting.
/n
	Increased pulse.
/n
	Hands tremble a bit, though barely noticable.
/n
	Tiny tactile and balance loss, which I suppose would go unnoticed.
/n
/n
18:40	Bodyload a chilled out stoned stimulation.
/n
	Thoughts and memory becoming light, mindfulness and peace.
/n
/n
18:50	Eyes are still like baseline, there is zero dilation of pupils.
/n
	Above mentioned side-effects remain.
/n
	Positive effects have remained a plateau since 18:30.
/n
/n
19:00   Breathing has grown a bit more shallow but no issue.
/n
	THe head sensations has spread, and is felt all over head, 
/n
	primarily at frontal cortex and temples.
/n
/n
19:20	What is not:
/n
	Speed, activation, euphoria, cns-stimulation, sexual arrousal, 
/n
	social enhancement, ego-boost, and hyperactivity.
/n
/n
	What is:	
/n
	Relaxation, a calm mix of stony body/mind stimulation, mindfulness.
/n
	The content of being is a sanctuary from impressions.
/n
	Everything just is but no name for any of that.
/n
	Release of naming, release of words and knowledge of anything.
/n
	The mind feels a bit like how I imagine being 2-3 years old.
/n
/n
/n
19:30	Taking a pause for now in noting.
/n
	I lie down in sofa and enjoy listening to the wind from the window. put on Beethoven's seventh, which I normally can't listen because the beauty overwhelms me.
/n
	How will it affect me now?
/n
/n
20:00	The music is passing through me without many emotions.
/n
	Music appreciation is not heightened, but rather disturbing my bliss.
/n
	but it activates me for what to do next.
/n
/n
21:00	I am now having a discussion on the net with a friend.
/n
	She tell me I am writing a lot and inspired. 
/n
	I have no problem of changing subject and being apprehensive of her,
/n
	but only after she mentioned my intense writing.
/n
	This means I am entering a speedy phase of mind certainly although
/n
	I didn't notice. Now the bodyload has lessened also.
/n
/n
21:30	Activation and speedy mind now. Communicating is important. 
/n
	Keeping focus on writing this report is decreased.
/n
	Interesting note, I am feeling a betterment in my ADHD.
/n
	I can focus better, switch focus between things without stress,
/n
	and I do not feel the constant wornout mental feeling.
/n
/n
22:20	I am listening to Shakti. The speediness has lessened to a more
/n
	normal state. I feel normal actually. 
/n
	Mentally I feel somewhat like when I were on Ritalin without
/n
	the nasty nausea I would get from it.
/n
	I am not feeling any urge to redose which is odd, considering this
/n
	has been reported. 
/n
	I have yet to experience any comedown and what it is like.
/n
	I am very hesitant to say this is good for ADHD even though I
/n
	presently get this feeling - I know it is only a temporary high.
/n
	The problem is firstly the effect now is different from 2 hours ago.
/n
	Now the bodyload has disappeared and feeling rather sleepy peripherally. Head is still stimulated but in a less speedy way. In a almost natural awakened way, if I may say so since I don't know 	how it is for normal people. I feel awake now, but thoughts are not racing.
/n
/n
23:00	I have got some rather good things done during the evening.
/n
	I wrote a poster with reminders for making budget which is a constant
/n
	problem for me, and also a mental reminder how to handle medications
/n
	and drugs in a way which works for me to not get addicted or abusing. 
/n
	Posted it on the wall for everyday reading in the morning.
/n
/n
/n
01:50   A very creative state of mind during the last three hours.
/n
	Loosing attention for this writing and enjoying texting online with
/n
	friends. I got a very clear mind for expressing some important issues
/n
	with a person who I found share some different experiences of reality 
/n
	which is very lonely to have nobody share with. I appreciated it very 
/n
	much. Focus is lost for writing more on the report in realtime, I am
/n
	enjoying texting with friends and my stoned attention is still
/n
	spinning with many ideas. Bodyload is gone and just tiredness.
/n
/n
05:00	Oh well, very sleepy.. The last six hours just passed like a breeze, 
/n
	can't believe it. Still having a alert head, but sleepy body. 
/n
	This is sure a long acting substance.
/n
/n
06:00	Back to baseline I think. What is now is the beyond sleepyness where I 	can get a false wakeful alertness, and refuse to go to bed although I know I would fall asleep in minutes and really need it and instead doing obsessive compulsive things. I am wary of going into a trance-like state which happen to me when underslept underfed and when the dopamine floods. 
/n
/n
08:00	I wrote a story of an life changing experience I had one year ago,
/n
	that I always wanted to get down on paper to a texting friend on the net. 
/n
	I am reminded by a person on the net to sleep now, and take the advice 
/n
	before I enter zombie-state. I have forgotten to eat properly.
/n
	Water as needed. Sleepy time now.
/n
/n
10:00	No sleepy time yet, getting up now and then turning rolling in bed.
/n
/n
13:00	I take a shower and do some business downtown. ADHD-confusion made worse by tiredness, noisy - crowded - ugly movement - aura of stress.
/n
/n
14:00	I take my adhd-medication Modiodal [modafinil] 100mg.
/n
/n
15:00	Now I am trying to sleep again, being pissed off so taking 2mg xanax, 20mg valium and 15mg zolpidem. but alas no sleep. I realized I should not have taken the Modiodal which actualy now is waking me up. 	
/n
/n
20:00	I spend the rest of the evening playing online game and beeing buzzed
/n
	on valium coffee and xanax, and wondering if a lower dosage of MDPV
/n
	yields lower duration than 18 hours.
/n

/n
		anorectic
/n
		double vision on high dosage/going long time

/n
/n
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/n
POSSIBLE USES I THOUGHT OF AFTER FIRST TRIAL
/n
/n
Medicational uses:
/n
* If taken in early morning in low dosage could potentialy be trialed for surrogate adhd-medication for emergency or very occasional energizer.
/n
* I strongly would disagree trying to take this DAILY as surrogate adhd-medication or energizer because finding a correct dosing that doesn't build tolerance I suspect would be very troublesome and also given the generally accepted FIENDISHNESS which I however did not experience. Not to mention reaching a steady state with eye-balling or even a scale with 1-2mg diff would be impossible.
/n
/n
Best usages in my opinion:
/n
/n
* I strongly would like try a whole day at a carnival, hanging out with friends talking philosophical or rubbish topics would be proper, festival, or just relaxing a sunny day in the park would be nice. 
/n
* A creative tool for a fine day of painting or writing or whatever artform. The plateaus of different effects make it both a peculiar and entertaining unreliable source for varying unexpectedness in creative outbursts! AND DO NOT BRING A BAG TO AVOID REDOSING.</bodytext></report>
