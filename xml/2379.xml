Pill Description
/n
----------------
/n
8mm round powder-blue pill. One side, stylized R. Other side, scored.
/n
Above score, '053'. Purported to be diazepam. Owing to the blue color, I
/n
guess that it is probably 10mg, as this is the color scheme that
/n
non-generic Valium uses. [Erowid Note : According to the Drug Identification Bible, this is a generic 10mg diazepam pill produced by Purepac Pharmaceutical]
/n
/n
1:50AM
/n
------
/n
I ingest the pill. We had a snowstorm today, and I had ingested some DPT
/n
earlier in the evening to go play in the foot deep snow (the first real
/n
snowstorm in over 3 years), but it has long since worn off. I also smoked
/n
a little pot earlier, but it has mostly worn off as well. I am more or
/n
less at baseline.
/n
/n
2:20AM
/n
------
/n
I begin to feel a little different. It's been a long time since I've had
/n
any benzodiazepines, but this does feel like what I remember. The main
/n
distinctions between the various benzodiazepines are in duration and
/n
intensity. Qualitatively they are all more or less the same. As far as
/n
comparison to other depressants, it is most similar to GHB, but definitely
/n
not the same. It's even less similar to alcohol, and only vaguely similar 
/n
to the narcotics. I will base most of my comparisons on GHB, that being
/n
the depressant I'm most familiar with. Diazepam is supposed to take about
/n
an hour to reach peak effect, so it's still too early to really describe
/n
it, or compare it to anything else. Initially, it seems as if there is
/n
more of a calming effect, but less of a euphoric effect than GHB. The
/n
physical sensations are somewhat different as well. There is more of a
/n
feeling of muscle relaxation than GHB produces, and the ecstasy-like 
/n
tactile enhancements of GHB are pretty much absent from the diazepam
/n
experience. The come-on is alot more gradual. I'm at T+0:30 now, and its 
/n
just beginning to take effect. I'll give it some more time.
/n
/n
2:50AM
/n
------
/n
Well, I'm now at T+1:00, and I'm feeling the diazepam pretty well... tho
/n
from what I've read, it can take from 1-2 hours for peak plasma levels.
/n
And I didn't have an empty stomach, so I'm sure I haven't reached the peak
/n
effect yet. I can feel it gradually increasing still, in fact. I'm a good
/n
deal more intoxicated than I was a half hour ago, but alot of my original
/n
assessments hold. Compared to GHB, this is a milder intoxication, in some
/n
ways. The muscle relaxation is alot stronger than with GHB. The sensation
/n
is similar to having just stepped out of a hot bath or sauna - totally
/n
relaxed muscles, a jello-like body feeling. There is much more of an urge
/n
to close the eyes than I get on GHB, though I don't feel sleepy at all.
/n
As I said earlier, this is much more of a calming, relaxing feel than the
/n
euphoric high of GHB. There is a touch of the strobe-like dizzy visual
/n
effect that I sometimes get from high doses of GHB, but it is much more
/n
subdued. I am listening to music through headphones... diazepam seems much
/n
more conducive to music appreciation than GHB. I keep getting drawn to lie
/n
down and just relax and absorb the music.
/n
/n
3:10AM
/n
------
/n
I'm at T+1:20 now. I think I've hit the peak effects. Diazepam seems to be
/n
more of a dumbing high than GHB... I find myself closing my eyes and just
/n
listening to music and and feeling the physical sensations, there is alot
/n
less noise in my mind than usual. Less thoughts flying back and forth.
/n
This is much more noticable than on GHB. I am feel as if sleep would be
/n
easy and pleasant at this point, but its not the irresistable passing out
/n
that GHB can cause. Putting on some more uptempo music dramatically
/n
increases my energy level, and vanquishes all thoughts of sleep. I feel
/n
very mellow and relaxed. I have a pleasant body high which is similar to
/n
GHB, yet distinct. More relaxed, less tingly. When I get up to walk
/n
around, I stagger a little... unlike alcohol and GHB though, this stagger
/n
doesn't seem to be due to dizziness or a loss of equilibrium, but rather
/n
due to the fact that my leg muscles are very relaxed, and my legs feel a
/n
little jello-like, sort of like if I had excersized them a great deal
/n
earlier. My whole body in fact is sort of slumped and very relaxed. None
/n
of my muscles seem to have any tension.
/n
/n
3:25AM
/n
------
/n
Still about the same place, but I feel myself yawning a little now. Not
/n
really tired at all though. I decide to smoke some marijuana at 3:35, or
/n
T+1:45.
/n
/n
3:35AM
/n
------
/n
I went outside and filled a juice glass full of loose snow. I spooned this
/n
snow into my bong, and loaded a hit into the bowl. I take a hit... the icy
/n
cold condensed smoke goes down smoothly and expands in my lungs.
/n
Immediately I feel a significant boost in the effects of the diazepam...
/n
though it has changed slightly from the THC now in my system. Considering
/n
the date and realizing that this snow storm is probably my last
/n
opportunity to take snow-bongs at least until next winter, I load another
/n
hit and suck it down. I cough pretty hard... Well, one more just for good
/n
luck! I feel pretty high now... I'll give it a few minutes to settle in,
/n
then describe it.
/n
/n
3:50AM
/n
------
/n
T+2:00 and feelin' groovy! I predominantly feel diazepam, but its now
/n
strongly colored by the pot. The mild shaky visual effect I noticed
/n
earlier is now noticably stronger, approaching the levels I'd expect from
/n
alcohol... I *feel* much more lucid than I would on GHB or alcohol...  But
/n
this is illusion. I'm clear headed, but *too* clear headed. There are far
/n
fewer verbal thoughts running through my mind than normal. But there is no
/n
feeling of confusion or disorientation. It is not a loss of coherence,
/n
just a drastic slowing of pace.
/n
/n
4:20AM
/n
------
/n
I take a puff, of course... I still feel about the same, and I think this
/n
report can be wound up now. It's T+2:30. Thinking about the diazepam and
/n
how the night has gone, it looks like its two primary actions seem to be
/n
as an anxiolytic and a muscle relaxer. There is a mild euphoria, but alot
/n
less than from GHB or alcohol - its more a feeling of relaxation than
/n
anything else. Granted I am alone right now, but this still feels much
/n
less of a social drug than GHB or alcohol, too - this is something I'd
/n
like to take by myself and lay in a hammock or on the beach. Not a party
/n
drug. I've enjoyed benzodiazepines every time I've done them, and find
/n
them far superior to alcohol. They're not something I enjoy enough to
/n
seek them out, but they're a nice treat when they come into my hands. I'm
/n
sure I will sleep well tonight!</bodytext></report>
