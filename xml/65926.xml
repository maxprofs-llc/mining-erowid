Xanax is everywhere around my school, and being an experienced pill popper I decided to purchase five, one milligram pills. When I got home I researched very well and decided that my dosage would be 2.5 mg. I waited until the perfect night, and swallowed the pills at 8:30.

Pleasant night, around a campfire with parents.

Playing guitar outside with my parents, arms and hands seem to move freely, and my whole body feels calm, and very comfortable.

I got up to go inside and I feel very wobbly, it feels almost the same as having a strong buzz from alcohol. I was pretty excited at this point and decided to snort 1/4 of another pill, bringing my dose to 2.75. Almost immediately after snorting I attempted to walk to the bathroom to put away the pill bottle. When I got there I realized I had been standing in the bathroom for 5 minutes without moving. I quickly remembered what my goal was and returned the pill bottle.

When I returned to the kitchen my mom offered me a beer and with all the force I could, I managed to say 'sure, sounds good' without slurring, after this I returned to the campfire and things began to get fuzzy.

My parents were having a conversation about something, but every time I tried to talk I could hear the words in my head but couldnt get them out of my mouth. During this time I tried to keep my eyes open but as I stared at the campfire they seemed intent on closing. While this was going on, my mom tried to ask me questions but I felt like someone had just gave me head surgery. All my responses were just meaningless grunts. She asked me if I was on anything and I replied 'I would never touch anything besides weed' she was pretty drunk so she believed me and went on with her conversation to my father. At this point I was completely exhausted from the energy it took me to talk to her and decided I should probably get away from my parents before I get caught. When I stood up I felt like I had just rolled down a hill. Everything was spinning, and I didnt think I would manage to make it to the door. Thankfully I did and retreated to the couch.

From this point I barely remember anything. My sister said I went to the fridge and got out the orange juice, but did not take one drink. She also said that I didnt even take one sip of the beer my mom gave me, even though I thought I thought I remembered drinking it. I have a small memory of going back outside to the fire, just sitting there and drooling, but my parents were so wasted by this point they didnt even notice. I also have small, fuzzy memories of taking a piss, and standing in my living room. And the last thing I remember is talking to my sister, and telling her I was on Xanax. After that the whole rest of the night was spent completely blacked out. I woke up in the morning with my shoes still on my feet and fully dressed. I sat in my bed and tried to remember how I got there, but I couldnt. When I stood up I felt pretty wobbly and my brain was quite 'clouded.' at about 3:00p.m this wore off and I was back to normal.

CONCLUSION:
/n
Xanax did not feel anything like I thought it would, I read that it would be mildly sedate like codeine, with mild euphoria. My experience was nothing like this. The whole time I felt incredibly drunk but also very slow, like it would be physically impossible to have a conversation. I would like to try it again at a lower dose, so I can actually experience and remember, the peak, and the come down.</bodytext></report>
