I got me a garbage bag full of khat leaves and sat down with a friend to chew the buggers down. What you're supposed to do is masticate the young soft leaves and keep the chunk in your cheeks (Don't swallow or spit anything, just suck on the juices). The taste is bitter as death himself, and you get the same feeling around your gums like you do when you eat a piece of unripened fruit.

I really can't tell you how much we chewed but after about 20 minutes we started feeling the first wave.  My mind became sharp as a razor.  My thinking became straight edged, like an arrow zooming towards its goal.  Complete awareness.  Every motion, every sound, every little nook in the wall has become visible.  I was energized, awake, speeding if you will, but not in a physical way.  My body was overcome with relaxation but my mind was jumping like a frog in a dynamite pond.  Not in any imaginary or abstract way, but in a very logical and practical form.  If you're looking for visuals then this isn't the place for it.

A very enjoyable experience to sum it up.</bodytext></report>
