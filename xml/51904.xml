I combined 20mg of 2C-I with 10mg of 2C-E.  I was going into unknown territory.

Set and Setting: an old friend of mine died earlier that day. I had planned to take the trip at a party that night; I got the call just as I was preparing to leave my apartment. I sat down and thought about it for a good twenty minutes. Should I still do it?

I resolved to go ahead with my plan. What else am I going to do, stay home and be depressed? Get drunk and maudlin?

The party took place on a nice plot of land out in the country. I was surrounded by fields, trees, and good friends. I took the medicine shortly after arriving.

Within two hours, I was walking through the set of a Tim Burton movie.

The alien stillness of the 2C-I combined with the morphing and blurring of the 2C-E for a powerful effect. Everything looked bent and surreal. Trees moved without wind. I saw a pile of logs morph into a set of dinosaur bones and sink into the earth. A pile of mulch became a grave.

I had what most would consider a 'bad trip' - but this led me to believe that it's not the content that matters, but what I do with it. I saw visions of my friend's lifeless body lying on a cold slab under fluorescent lighting. I saw coroners tearing him apart. I imagined him afraid in his final moments.

These visions were horrible, but necessary. All were things that I would have been thinking about for weeks; the psychedelics helped me to work through most of it in a single night. I felt no sadness - I don't know if this was an effect of the chemicals or if I was simply still in shock. I didn't freak out.

I found that I could carry on several separate conversations simultaneously. This amused my friends to no end.

The ride home was interesting. The yellow and white lines of the road stood out like neon.

I couldn't sleep a wink. Even after the peak, I remained in a psychedelic buzz until the following afternoon, when I was finally able to rest. I slept only a few hours before waking refreshed.

I did grieve over the next few days. Psychedelics can't replace simple human feelings. Even so, I feel that the experience helped me in some way.</bodytext></report>
