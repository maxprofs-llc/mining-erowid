I have tripped off of DXM many times before.  I have done Delsym, Robitussin, Coricidin Cough and Cold, and the generic equivalent of those.  But by far, my favorite is Pure Powder.  I have also taken Codeine numerous times before, and considered it a weak drug compared to Demerol or Percoset, and usually only taken when I could mix it with alcohol.  Well onto the trip...

It was a Saturday night in around December, and around 11:30 I popped a 650mg pill of DXM.  During this time I just poked around the Internet, talked to some of my fellow robo'ers that night online, and did the usual thing.  At about 12:30 I feel myself very near peak, and quite happy with the trip.  But I also wanted to feel more.  Here I was lying on my bed, some Paul Oakenfold pumping into my headphones, wanting more.  It was one of those nights where you feel comfortable, and everything is going right.  So I basically attempted to think (not too easy without your mind going off on a tangent) about taking the codeine, or take another pill of dxm.  It was already about 1AM, and I didn't want to wait another hour for the pill to kick in.  So I took 3 pills of Tylenol #3.

After ingestion I waited some, and was talking to a close friend of mine who also has taken DXM and he said at around 1:45 my typing became so messed up you couldn't recognize a thing.  From what I recall from the next couple hours unveil like this:  At first I felt a VERY powerful physical, liquid like feeling.  I felt like I was Mercury.  Then I went to the bathroom (which is normal for staying up all night) and I had the WORST robo walk ever. (For those of you who don't know a robo walk is when on robo, you feel either VERY heavy or VERY light, or both.  And you cannot walk straight no matter what, I also like to call it Godzilla legs).  I was stammering across my house ever so slowly. I thought I would never get there.  Finally I got back to my bed, when my vision went.  Your vision isn't great on DXM as it is, and I got this weird very heavy strobing effect to it.  When I looked at my clock, it appeared there were mini-blinds in front of my eyes opening and closing really fast.  Then the most intense euphoria I have ever felt swept over my body, and all at once my thoughts went, and I closed my eyes and saw a wonderful football field.  I was sitting on the bench waiting to go in, for my big chance.  I finally went in and scored the winning touchdown.(and for some reason this took place in Texas, and I live in Jersey).  Then I open my eyes back up thinking to myself, 'well that must have taken over a hour, I can easily do that again and then fall asleep'. 2:15 read the clock.  So I put on a winamp visual plugin and watched the screen and listened to more trance, as my thoughts ran crazy.  Things like 'wow that color is nice, I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow, who am I, where is this place, I like to play football, this computer sure is far away'  odd things like that, very quickly and very rapidly ran through my mind.  At about 3:30ish I am guessing I fell asleep, at least thats the last time I remember, though it may be possible I closed my laptop and then fell asleep at 4:30.  I woke up the next morning with WORST dxm hangover I ever had.  I felt weird, my cough reflex was GONE, my body tingled, music still has slight pleasure to it, everyone else said I looked tired, and worn out, and when I went to work at 3PM, it seemed to be like I was a drone, I just did my work and that was it.

Looking back on this trip, I can compare it to a 1200mg or a 4th plateau experience on DXM.  Though a 4th plat trip has more dissociation involved, there were times that I didn't know who I was or where I was.  Since then I have tried to recreate this trip just once, but was very unsuccessful, and due to the bad hangover dont think I would do it anymore.</bodytext></report>
