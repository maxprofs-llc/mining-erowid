Well, I ate about one eighth of mushrooms about 4:00 am one fine Saturday morning (the sunrise was awesome!). I had a very revolutionary and spiritual trip, etcthen went home. I then worked for nine hours. At about 11:30 pm Saturday night, I went over to see my two best friends. I told them I tripped that morning, and the things that happened during my trip. They were quite pissed that I did not bring any shrooms for them. I told them I had another bag but it only had a gram left in it. They asked me to smoke it, and of course I replied, 'you cant smoke mushrooms, heat destroys the psychoactive agent, blah blah.'

They replied that you indeed can smoke mushrooms, but the experience is very different. They told me it was comparable to tweaking for a short while, rather than tripping. I said that is a complete waste of the wonderful fungi, but they were pissed I had no shrooms for them, so I gave in.

We smoked one fat cap and several stems in a glass bowl. The shrooms were very difficult to light. The taste was wretched! I dont mind the taste of chewed mushrooms, but burnt was disgusting! I began to feel a strong energy surge (was good since I was awake for over 24 hours at this point). It was nothing comparable to tweaking from crystal meth, but it was a tweaked, speedy feeling nonetheless. I only wanted three or so hits, the taste was horrible and I had no desire for a speedy drug when I sure needed sleep! I received no mental trip sensation whatsoever, and no visuals of any sort. Just a strong, alert, awake feeling. My two friends proceeded to smoke the rest of the gram, which took them a minute or five. They had some very tweaked out looks on their faces. I laughed at a very close friend of mine, and he became extremely paranoid and told me not to look at him (paranoid tweakiness I guess). Well basically nothing interesting at all happened.

I would conclude that smoking mushrooms is a terrible waste of the wonderful fungi. EAT THEM!</bodytext></report>
