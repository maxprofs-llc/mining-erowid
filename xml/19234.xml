Being experienced with MANY psychedelics, I was extremely excited to try 2C-B. It just so happened some became available and we ordered $200 worth for the group of us. It arrived the next day, (talk about service) and we ended up doing it one warm summer day a week later. We knew exactly how much we received, but like many didn't have a scale to determine how much to take. We ended up dividing it into four equal piles, then those four into another four and by simple math determined our doses to be APPROXIMATELY correct. I highly recommend against doing this. While it may work fine for ketamine, or somthing a little more forgiving of dose, it's not a good idea when 5mg can be the difference between perfect and WAY TOO MUCH.

We ended up snorting our dose, with an EXTREME burning following. I had never felt such a crazy burn. Within 5 minutes my good friend looks at me and says, 'WHOOOOA. I don't know about this.' This was disturbing because he has never said that, and i've seen him on huge doses of various psychedelics. A huge rushing vibrating sensation overtook me, and I was visibly shaking. I felt a little like the beginning of an extremely intense MDMA experience minus the euphoria. Then it began.. visuals slowly seething out of everywhere: swirling colours, distortions very similar to that of mushrooms. This grew exponentially over the next few minutes. Nausea overtook my companions and they were violently throwing up. I myself felt mildly nauseous but didn't throw up.

By this point I still had myself together, which I attribute to previous experience with other psychedelics. I was amazed by what was happening I could barely tell the difference between the sky and the ground besides one being a slightly different colour than the other. I lay down in the grass outside my friend's house and was staring at my arm. The hairs on my arm were indistingushable from the grass. At this point I had an amazing thought.. I was feeling very sober-minded for being in the state I was. If I had got to this point on mushrooms/LSD I would have been completely incoherent.

From this point my friends stayed at this level, a level which they couldn't even see what was ahead of them, but they stayed intact mentally and enjoyed the experience. I however, being the smallest and perhaps taking a bit more, kept on getting higher. I remember having trouble distinguishing sounds from colours, and even feelings from what I saw. I essentially broke down inside, entered a loop and began mumbling to myself. Mentally I really lost it, and I mean that in a literal sense. I didn't know who I was, or even that I had taken a drug for a while. I couldn't see my friends and was lost in a sea of swirling colours. I lay on the couch for approximately 45 minutes groaning and repeating myself over and over.

After that episode I suddenly realized I was alive. A huge amazing rush of euphoria overwhelmed me and I was no longer afraid. As soon as the delusional state had come, it disappeared. I was still very high but I got myself completely back and I felt great. I looked around and everyone had left me, I went outside and saw them all there. I was simply euphoric to be alive and I exclaimed, 'I'm alive.' Everyone was happy to see I was doing better and smiled. However they were not understanding that I seriously meant it. I ran around ecstatic, really enjoying the experience once again. Afterwards I was not afraid of trying 2C-B again, I wasn't left with that disquieting feeling I feel after a bad mushroom/LSD trip, I felt great. I had some left over and did it again, approximately half as much by myself and had a very enjoyable experience.

All in all, its an amazing drug, profoundly visual while much nicer/less rewarding on the mind than trypamines. I would consider it as more of a 'fun' drug than that of inspiring one. I didn't have any emotional revlations but it was an amazing experience.</bodytext></report>
