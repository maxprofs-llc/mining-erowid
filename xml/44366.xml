A little background: Through a friend I had acquired 2 hits of dragon blotter acid. I hadnt dropped acid in a year before this, and this was to be my first solo acid trip. This also was my first trip in months, with the exception of one salvia experience a little while ago. I am on no medication and I have abstained from all drugs the day before.

The night before I went to bed early, and I woke at 9 am. I picked up a little around the house, took a shower, shaved, and ate a small breakfast consisting of a mango and a glass of water. I was so excited, I could barely contain myself, and soon the hour approached. At 10:30 am I decided it was time and I put both hits on my tongue. You could not wipe the grin off my face even if you tried. As I waited for the acid to kick in, I chatted on IRC and put on a dead show.

My room was set up with some psychedelically inspired posters and a black light. As the trip started to set in I decided to check out the trip toys on my computer. A couple days before the trip I had downloaded a set of trip tracks from a friend of mine, having listened to these before, I knew they where good. I also downloaded a very nice winamp visualization program called milkdrop. I turned off my light, closed the curtains and put on the black light. Then I turned on the tunes through headphones and put on milk drop and set up the monitor so I could be comfy in my bed while observing the milkdrop. This was without a doubt the strongest acid trip I have ever had, the visuals were incredible. Everything was going crazy around me, around me objects took on a cartoony look, proportion no long meant a thing. It was as if I was in a psychological hall of mirrors. I was seeing some of the most fantastic visuals I have ever had on any drug, the cartoon-like patterns were absolutely mesmerizing. I was hit by a tsunami of emotions, a lot of love and happiness; I was on cloud nine. The tunes were amazing as well, everything seemed flow just right.

After tripping in my room for a long while, I decided to change my setting. There are a lot of flowers, both wild and planted, blooming around my area this time of year. I sat down in the grass and quietly look on. Everything was alive and vibrant, it was absolutely aw-inspiring. The scenery around me took a crystallized character, it was as if I was wearing diamond glasses. I felt very much a part of nature, and though it wonderful to be alive. There was a divine spirit within me, something I have never felt before. It brought tears of joy to my eyes and I wished that everyone could experience what I was experiencing right at that moment.

After going inside I put on a movie called Festival Express and chilled out with a new appreciation of life and renewed love for LSD. If you havent yet experienced the love, I really hope you do. I tripped well into the night, I was very tired, but I was content, very satisfied with my experience. I was essentially down around 11 pm, though I did not fall asleep until 2 am. The next morning I woke up early and felt great, I was very grateful to the LSD gods for the opportunity to have a very successful and enlightening first solo acid trip.</bodytext></report>
