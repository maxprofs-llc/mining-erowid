Around two years ago I got interested in absinthe, and all the 'green fairy' tales. After researching Absinthe, its active substances, etc... I decided to try and smoke wormwood, to get a 'thujone' high.
/n
/n
(first time) 
/n
I did the 'thujone hash', and rolled it in a joint: the wormwood hash mixed with tobacco.
/n
- didn't really feel anything.
/n
/n
(second time)
/n
I made more of the hash, but this time I smoked it almost pure in a joint.
/n
- no effect whatsoever
/n
/n
(third time)
/n
This time I made around the same amout of hash as in the first time, but decided to smoke it in a pipe.
/n
I was convinced that nothing would happen, but here it goes.

I put the hash on the pipe and off I went. The smoke was light and barely noticeable
/n
/n
T+0:05
/n
stopped smoking and went to the bathroom. When I open the door, the whole toilet looked like a sauna, it looked as if I had smoked in there.

I turn on some music and lie in bed just mildly appreciating the music, and the curtains which appeared to move in a wavyish way. I felt really comfortable with the whole atmosphere.

/n
I sit on my chair to turn the music off, but the bass box seems to get larger, so I just stare at it trying to convince myself it's not growing.

T+0:25
/n
I feel normal again.

/n
My experience was pretty nice, but very short. I think that it worked better on the pipe rather than rolled.</bodytext></report>
