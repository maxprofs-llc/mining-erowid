As I have had a difficult time finding experiences of people trying mescaline whilst taking antidepressants I have decided to write this.
/n
/n
Doses
/n
nortiptyline :20 mg (daily)
/n
 mescaline    :approx   trip 
/n
(based on a 75cm piece of san pedro 10 cm in diameter containing 4 trips)
/n

We started the day by preparing the pedro. First we removed the husks and cut off all the green slime. This was then boiled for approximately 4 hrs stirring occasionally. The mixture was then strained through a cloth and the liquid was divided between the 4 of us. I had read about the additive effect of tricyclics on hallucinogenic drugs so I only wanted to at the most take  a trip on this occasion.

It was my 20th birthday and I was in a pretty excited but nervous state of mind. I wondered if it would end up turning out bad (mabey ending up in hospital) but I felt safe in the fact that I had my friends to look after me if anything went wrong. At the same time I thought that hallucinogenic drugs were probably talked up quite a bit but if they werent I'd have a blast. It was a party atmosphere where my friends were drinking and having a fun time. 
/n
/n
(time 0) I decided to only take  of a trip (just to be safe) and drank the vile tasting liquid (not as bad as I had been told though) in several goes. I then walked round the house to wait for it to start to kick in.
/n
/n
(time 45 mins) A short time after I had taken it I felt quite queasy, I had sensations that my body was heavy and things just didnt feel quite right. The only time I have felt this feeling before is when I was put on a new prescription medication and they were non-compatible. After 10 mins or so this sensation had left me apart from things not feeling quite right (probably the drug starting to kick in).
/n
/n
(time 1 hr) Nothing much had happened to this point,I was starting to think I had been screwed. I had seen an aura behind one of my friends but that was all.
/n
/n
(time 1  hrs) I decided that if it was going to kick in it would have kicked in by then so I took the other  of my trip and then ate a few spoons full of cookies (cookies are the pulp left in the muslin after straining) and played the waiting game.
/n
/n
(time 2hrs) The trip had now kicked in. I was running round the house yelling and screaming about stuff (like distorted reflections in a window) and I was unable to stop laughing. I would see something,and in my mind it was the most hilarious thing that I had ever seen. I was almost rolling round on the floor because things were so funny. Not  many visual effect to this point though.
/n
/n
(time rest of trip) After the uncontrollable laughing stopped I started to get quite cool visual effects. These included, my shoes talking to each other (one was happy one was angry), having posters winking at me, running through a forest of trees with facial expressions (while I was sitting on the couch), seeing Diablo and seeing a blue tunnel that wanted me to walk down it when I closed my eyes or hid under a blanket (it protected me from the outside world the blanket that is).
/n
/n
In general my experience was far more intense than any of my friends who took full trips. They didnt get anywhere near as intense hallucinations as I did. But they did get some mild effects. 
/n
/n
This experience has changed my life. I didnt know that anything could be as intense or as funny as that. I had my best birthday to date (and probably forever) and it will never be forgotten.

Note To Reader:
/n
This was just my own personal experience and there was nothing scientific(or medical) about the above experience. I am only writing this to show people who are on tricyclics to be careful when  trying hallucinogenic drugs.</bodytext></report>
