I'm in the military and would like to add some information to the drug testing vault on oxycodone. During each drug test the U.S. Army does (I can only speak for the U.S. Army as it's the branch I'm in and have been for 3+ years now), they always test for the Basic NIDA 5 and one or two extra ones I can't recall, but do not always test for oxycodone or other opiates that primarily break down into morphine or codeine. They rotate the testing for it on a what seems to be a random type rotation. They say it in the briefing I always recieve before the test. Further proof of this is that of the many times I've been tested I did oxycodone 1-2 days before the test and should have failed with absolute certainty. Other drugs im sure are in the rotation are codeine, and benzos.</bodytext></report>
