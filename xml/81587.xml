I take Zyprexa on a daily basis for depression and it helps I suppose. I was told it should help my anxiety also which it very well does not, but oh well.

I've been on zyprexa for just over two weeks this time around and it doesn't do anything other than make me a little tired and very very hungry. All I want to do now is eat or go make me something to eat. I think I'm going to tell my doctor that I want to discontinue taking the zyprexa due to the rapid weight gain I'm experiencing.</bodytext></report>
