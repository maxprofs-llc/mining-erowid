I've been reading about Blue Lotus but not finding a whole lot of information so I decided to give it a try.  I ordered 30g from Louisville Botanicals and received my shipment just yesterday. The stuff arrived in a heavy ziplock bag and was a 5x extract powder. It was tan in color and did not have much of a smell.  After reading all of the trip reports here on Erowid, I decided to do both the tea and smoking it.  I began with the tea.

I boiled enough water for 2 tea cups.  I measured out 2 grams of Blue Lotus powder and stirred it into the hot water after I poured the water into the mug.  I made 2 cups; one for me and one for my girlfriend and we both had 2 grams of product in the tea.  I let the tea sit for 20 minutes. Please note that I did not use any tea bags or anything like that, I just put the powder in the water and it disolved nicely.  I added a little sugar to taste.  We very easily downed the mugs within 2 minutes if that as the water was cooling after sitting for 20 minutes.  The flavor was not bad at all and went down very easy.

After this, I began making dinner.  I wanted the tea to go down on an empty stomach.  About 45 minutes in, I began to feel lightly hazed as if I had maybe 4 hits of decent weed.  I tried packing a bowl of Blue Lotus, but being that it was a powder, I could not get any oxygen through it to smoke it.  I did get a little to burn but I never got much smoke off it and I might have only gotten about 1/2 gram to burn/smoke.  I decided the powder is not good for smoking and I would like to get some dried plant matter to smoke and save the powder for tea.

1 hour in, we decided to roll up some MJ and smoke. My girl and I blazed a half of blunt and put it out. Therefore we each had 1/4 of the blunt.  I was definitely feeling the 'high' feeling from the MJ and I was also feeling a distinctly different FLOATING AND RELAXED GASSY feeling.  We were watching Chris Rock on HBO doing his stand up comedian material and I have never laughed harder in my life. I say this so that you know I probably had extra endorphins floating around inside me. Maybe the 'high' also made me that much more giddy..

I laid back and cuddled a bit with my girlfriend.  She was NOT experiencing the same as me.  She felt the tea buzz like I did but the cannibis did not facilitate anything more for her and as a matter of fact she didnt even get all that high on the weed.  When I laid back and closed my eyes, I kid you not, I swear I was doing double back flips through the clouds!  I felt so DRIFTY, so SEDATE, so FLOATY and peaceful.  I felt as if I had been professionally gassed in an anesthetic way.  I swear you could have pulled six of my molars and showed them to me and I probably would have grinned and said something like 'neat'.  This was definitely different than what I experience on weed and I could feel the two working together. I also had some visual disturbances- I saw blue trails when my girlfriend hit her blunt and then her hand went down, it was followed by bright blue trails.  I also saw very slight colored trails when I shifted my eyes from one object to another. I also kept seeing something 'flying around' just out of vision up in the air in my apartment. I swear there was either a moth or a fairy flying around but I could never put my eyes on it. It was just a dark little shadow that would zoom around from time to time up near the ceiling. My girlfriend saw no such thing.

We then dozed off together and I slept and awoke fine with no side effects.

I plan to do this more maybe adding another 1/2 gram to the tea. I would really like to get plant material so that I could drink the tea and smoke a full bowl of it also.  Hell. After reading the above, maybe I dont need to increase the dose!

Oh yeah. I'm very interested in Ray Allen's reports on Blue Lotus here on Erowid- but I did not have the aura thing going on this time around. I had more of an opium/gassed feeling that was very very pleasant.

I reccommend Blue Lotus to anyone interested. Keep in mind it seems to work well with other substances and I plan to try it with wine also. Taken alone, it is probably compared best to codeine or vicadin. I'll keep you informed.
