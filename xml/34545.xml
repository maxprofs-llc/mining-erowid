One Saturday night, I received some Vicodin pills from a friend, (x5) 5/500 MG ones to be exact, equalling 25MG. My experience is written below as followed. Also, I have had many experiences with psychoactives, mostly pills.

11:00 PM- Feeling quite wonderful, and wish this would last forever. I have tooken over 35 MG of Vicodin before, but 17-25 MG seems to work for me. Many thoughts race through my head, and nirvana seems to cloud my mind.

11:20 PM- I watched the end of Matrix: Revolutions, and enjoy the spectacular special effects, that seem to look even more amazing than usually. My girlfriend Devan stops by, and is on 2 Oxycodone pills. We begin to make love, and the joys of this world rush through every fiber in my body, as well as Devans.

11:45 PM- Still making love with Devan. Feeling overpowered by Passion. Our eyes meet and she is more beautiful then a breath of spring air. True love is experienced, as we reach the peak of the sacred act. Devan and I both experience an Orgasm, which to this day, is undescribable by my tounge.

12:00 AM- Finished making love. I feel extreme joy, and happy to be alive. We both get into the bathtub, and bath each other. The water tempature was perfect and I wouldn't have changed anything was felt, as we cleansed each other.

12:20 AM- We lie down together and fall asleep into a great slumber, and heavenly dreams came upon me. I dreamt I was flowing in space, passing many stars and planets. It was amazing. Everything was perfect that night.

NEXT DAY: I wake up, and Devan is still asleep. It's 10:00 AM, and I get ready for work. I will never forget that night. It was one of the greatest trips and most passionate night I have ever had.

EXTRA NOTES: I enjoyed Vicodin very much, considering it to be a mild psychoactive. Devan was on Oxycodone, which is also an Opiate as you know, so I must thank the Opiate drug family for such an incredibly journey that we were tooken on. There was no hallucinations or Mind-Body Seperation that DXM, MDMA or Mushrooms have brought before, but that night, I felt something else, and the power of love was shone upon me like the blazing sun as it shines her light to the ground in which we stand upon.</bodytext></report>
