This is not the thing to have a good time, but rather like most reports state, just tastes bitter as fuck. It does however create a wonderful high that can make me fall asleep better and longer than any ambien I've taken. Maybe the day we start learning about these herbs is a day to enjoy.</bodytext></report>
