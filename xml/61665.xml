i just ate DOI 30 hours ago. And it should be out of my system. The problem is that I left a urin sample 20 min ago and it triggered positive for MDMA. Just thought you should know that so that others get to know about that it can trigger a false positive. You should also inform people that Temgesic tests positive for Morfine.</bodytext></report>
