Since my last post [/n], I have been continuing my researches with Anadenanthera colubrina, which I refer to as Yopo.  /n  I decided to look at my notes from the past year and put together another report.
/n
/n
Shortly after my last posted experiment I tried this-
/n
8g P. harmala [syrian rue]
/n
8 seeds A colubrina [yopo]
/n
/n
T+0- 1 capsule equal to 4g harmala ingested.
/n
/n
T+9min- As usual, the harmala hits quickly, relaxation seeps in, gently and in waves, like the come-on to MDMA. Should note that this experiment begins 25 hours after ingesting a large dose of methadone.
/n
/n
T+30min- Ingest 1 capsule = to 4g harmala. Already quite spacy and drowsy.
/n
/n
T+55min- Still able to read and write, may need to take more harmala.
/n
/n
T+1hr- Take capsules containing 8 large Yopo seeds = to about 1g, finely powdered to enhance absorbtion. Begin doing some routine housework.
/n
/n
T+1:20 to T+2hr- Several waves of nausea result in multiple painful purgings.
/n
/n
T+2hr to T+6:30- Narcotic effect, I am effectively Knocked out, same as my reaction to 14g harmala + 28g M. hostilis (turns out that the hostilis was bunk and I have since found that 8-16g of harmala without an active stimulant or psychedelic will have an overpowering sedative effect. I don't think that the methadone contributed.)
/n
/n
T+7hr- Still feel dull, daxed, drowsy, numb, heavy-limbed.
/n

Around the same time period, I tried experimenting with snuffs in combo with harmala. A traditionally prepared snuff of 10 yopo seeds and about a half gram of burnt, powdered snail shells was insufflated deeply about a half hour after a 4g oral dose of harmala. This was more active than the oral doses, more relaxed and gentle than the smoked doses, mostly just a mild harmala trip with some added stimulation, some hints of euphoria and a very nasty, bitter, numbing drip.
/n

These early experiments convinced me that smoking was the most effective mode of administration and produced the fewest side effects. I found that a plain aqeous extraction, dried to a resin and smoked on cannabis was a very consistent and convenient way to use this plant medicine. I have now been smoking this extract occasionally to regularly for the past year, and have learned these things.
/n

1. A.colubrina is not a classic psychedelic, does not produce overpowering sensory or mental effects at any dose. Smoking large amounts of extract quickly only leads to more intense physical symptoms identical to those described in TIHKAL for bufotenine. 250 mg of 4x extract could not possibly contain more than a couple mg 5Meo-DMT. I think bufotenine is almost certainly the only active ingredient.
/n
/n
2. Yopo has numerous useful psychoactive and medicinal effects at low doses. 50-150 mg of 4x extract = to about 2-6 seeds is a typical dose.
/n
The initial rush hits almost immediately, with an undescribable body feeling that I now find quite euphoric, now that I am used to it. The heart may speed up and I become acutely aware of the feeling of my blood rushing through my veins. At higher doses, Muscle spasms, pulsating feelings in the head accompanied by intense flushing, immobilization, nausea, gasping and difficulty breathing can occur during this stage, especially in combo with harmala.
/n
/n
The mental effects begin to intensify a couple minutes after smoking, by which time most of the physical symptoms have mellowed out. The effect is strangely cannabis-like, with a high, open-headed feeling and a clarity of thought that is great for introspection, deep thoughts or just daydreaming. Mixes great with cannabis, the colubrina lends a clarity and focus, offsetting the fogginess of weed, and its stimulant effects counteract the lethargy commonly caused by too many pipes. The anti-nausea effect of the cannabis smooths out the high considerably. Once the initial rush is over, relaxation can be extreme. Several friends have tried this smoking mixture and have had similar experiences and impressions. My girlfriend, S, who avoids drugs in general (aside from medicinal cannabis) and especially stimulants and psychedelics, surprised me by actually acquiring a taste for this extract.

The first few times she smelled the characteristic odor of the smoke, she was quite repulsed, likening it to burnt tuna fish. The first time she tried it, she had been complaining of a severe headache, mild fever and general malaise, so I offered her some yopo on some cannabis and she felt much better after only a few hits. She now uses the smoke regularly, especially for headaches. She is very sensitive to side effects, and usually uses a small dose of extract, 25-40mg with cannabis, interspersing yopo hits with hits of straight cannabis, taking a few minutes to finish her portion. She obtains relief from anxiety, headaches and cramps without significant psychoactive effects.

The extract seems to show a normalizing effect on emotion and energy. It makes a great stimulant in cases of laziness or drowsiness, and has an anxiolytic, relaxing effect when one is angry, frustrated or afraid. The psychoactive effects lastup to 30 min, and can be extended by smoking more, without any tolerance even after hours of smoking. There appears to be no need for the quick-smoke method used for DMT and Salvia. I have used this extract in combo with fenfluramine, harmala, psilocybe mushrooms, san pedro, opium, vicodin and alcohol.
/n
/n
With fenfluramine, the yopo effects are attenuated during the initial pro-serotonergic phase and intensified during the second, serotonin-depleted stage. 
/n
/n
Yopo adds a nice lift to the tail of a shroom or san pedro trip.
/n
Its clarity and stimulation can enhance the euphoria of opiates, but tends to intensify the nausea.
/n
/n
My favorite combo is with alcohol, though I do not generally drink. For some reason, the personalities of these two intoxicants seem compatible. Keep the alcohol dose fairly low and avoid sugary, dark or flavored alcohol and it will greatly enhance the mental effects of the yopo.

I am now out of smokable extract, but I feel that I have sufficiently explored this mode of administration. I am now planning on continuing my explorations with oral yopo in imitation of the ancient Inca cult of Vuilca, who made a drink of the seeds with an admixture that may have been caapi. I have already prepared a fermented brew of 3g Yopo seeds and 40g B caapi, and will write soon to let you know how it goes.</bodytext></report>
