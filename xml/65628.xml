While on probation I looked to many substances other than weed to get a buzz. DXM, DPH, Nutmeg,and other ones that SHOULDN'T cause a positive for THC, Cocaine, Morphine or Amphetamine the drugs I am tested for.

I used oxy before I was on probation, for about a month. Then my supply ran out. Looking back I am glad that happened because I was using it very frequently.

Anyways, it was about a year after that, and I knew I was having a test the following day. My friend gave me 7 oxy's in school. Over the course of the day I snorted them all.

So the next day I go to get a screen. Just like I thought, it came back negative. Oxycodone DID NOT cause a positive result fo MORPHINE. IT WILL CAUSE A POSITIVE FOR OPIATES HOWEVER. Oxycodone does not get converted into morphine so if I get tested only for morphine I am pretty safe.</bodytext></report>
