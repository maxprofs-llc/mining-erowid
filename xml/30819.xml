I have heard much about inhalants but I had never thought about trying them until the other day.

Ok here it goes it was the other day and I was really bored because I had no drugs to do and then my cousin lets call him james well anyway james asked me if I wanted to try some inhalants. I decedied that it won't hurt so we went out to my gargage and grabbed a can of spray paint and so old rags and began inhaling at first I thought I wasnt going to work then out of the blue it hit.

I felt a light rush simialar to a low level meth dose. James stared talking to me and I saw the sound come out of his mouth it was mind blowing and could not find the words to respond to james so I just stared. My body parts were making their own music and it was very wonderful this all lasted for a total of about a minute or 2.
