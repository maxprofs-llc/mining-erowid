I was first given a small dose of this powdered substance [MDPV] a few weeks ago and found it very pleasant, and so I decided that when I got paid next that = would purchase some for myself to expirement with.

I drove over to the local porn shop that carried the substance as a 'condensed bath salt' and I, being the fool that I am, was do0ped into buying two 500mg containers instead of one to save $10. I was very excited.

I randomly snorted a line in the car before I started my drive home. I felt very good within 5 minutes and even better in the 15 it took me to get home. /n  It was very much a 'heady' high. Pressure in the eyes and such. Slight euphoria. I continued doing lines/bumps when I started feeling a come down. Now I must tell you all that I did this without researching the chemical or knowing proper doseage &gt;./n

After about 2-3 hours of indulging in what I thought at first was an amazing thing I decided to take a drive. The lights in the street were very bright and there were sunbursts from every source of light. My eyes became enraged and I quickly went home. I knew then that I shouldn't do more but did anyhow. I spent the whole night up peaking out of windows.

The next day I had off of work and the MDVP just kept coming. Come morning I was still awake, very paranoid, and I believe I was seeing and hearing things. My apartment didn't feel like my apartment any longer. In fact it felt like I was in an entirely different world only backwards or 'bizarro' like on Seinfeld. Gratz if you get the reference :p ... anyhow throughout the day I swear to you I could hear my neighbors having sex next door. I truly believe this was happening. Two car loads of guys were going in and out and this carried on for hours and into the night. I remember texting my girlfriend explaining that the people next door were having an orgy and I felt like calling the police so I didn't have to listen.

When I sent the text I heard very loud sex noises outside my window and so I took a peek. There were lights on in the back yard of the neighbors behind and I saw a man walking towards a shed in towards some shadows (kinda looked like a cop.) The noises continued and I heard some hollering. By this time I had moved my bedding into the living room to avoid the noises. Soon after the noises stopped. All of the cars that were there left except one. I decided it was ok to return to my room. As soon as I lay down I heard a shower kick on and sex through the walls! This was short lived and then the last car left. Hallucinations? Who knows.

I also witnessed my coffee table float up about 6 inches. I felt like a jedi. I wasn't sure if it was really moving so I held my foot still and it still moved up. When I looked at its legs they were still on the ground... weird.

All of this was followed by extreme bad mood... severe depression... eye inflammation which caused 'flashing blue lights' look it up... and extreme red eye among other things.

All together around 500-550mg in a 2 night binge not a good idea.
