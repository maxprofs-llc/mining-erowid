57...suffer from migraines...trade equities from home office (day trader)...ex drummer from the 60's...done my share of drugs long ago...drive a dodge viper...wonderful wife...wonderful life. heard salvia alleviates migraines, so i decide to give it a try. different doctors have tried different anti-depressants, anti-convulsants along with various other meds. vicodin and percocet plus imitrex, now amerge, are the only drugs that bring relief.

I don't experiance the highs from the pain killers as when i first started using them back around 1980. i started taking 300mg of lamictal about 2 years ago and noticed the migraines lessening in severity and in quantity, but developed hand tremors to the point that i could hardly write my name. latest doctor looked up info in data base and found tremors to be one of the side effects of lamictal (anti-convulsant.) said 300mg might be a bit much and now has me down to 100mg at bedtime along with clorazepate 10mg to help with jitters. been on that dose for five weeks. tremors almost gone, but migraines occurring more often. so, i bought some salvia on ebay.

One night about 10 pm, informed wife, who was on her laptop on the kitchen island, i was gonna try some salvia and to kind of make sure i don't get up and wander outside. went to bathroom and prepared a pipe, home made. used a lighter made for lighting logs in a fireplace. a couple deep exhales and one large inhale held for about 30 seconds. exhaled and inhaled second time. ahhh, nice feeling starting to come over me. better head to spare bedroom down the hall before i begin to stumble, as i hear happens when smoking salvia.

I start to walk out of bathroom and as i enter hallway i hear a male voice to my right saying (in spanish) 'he's not gonna make it.' i also hear two or three female voices on my left saying (also in spanish) 'oh yes he will.' now....i'm mexican, but don't speak but fully understand spanish. i get to the bedroom and sit on the edge of the bed, with light on. looking at wall in front of me. all of a sudden in front of me a large funnel appears, which is made of red vines which aren't too tightly woven, with red leaves. i recall seeing the bedroom walls thru it. it's as round as the room is. i look downwards towards the end of it, it seems as though it's about maybe a couple hundred feet deep. all of a sudden i'm standing on a dirt path, maybe the middle of the street, but standing in sandy dirt. across the street i see two kids walking to the left. behind me i hear the sounds of kids playing, as though in a playground. maybe ten of em. giggling, calling each other. just having fun. then i realize i'm in the neighborhood i grew up in when i was a year old. then i must have blinked and then noticed the wall in front of me.

I started to come around and just sat on the edge of the bed and felt amazed and plain wonderful at what just happened. i stumbled into the kitchen where the wife was, on her laptop, and put my right arm around her shoulder and gave her a nice hug and kissed her. i started to laugh while walking around the kitchen trying to explain what i just went thru. i laughed for a couple minutes. she sez 'musta been nice.' she's never done a single drug in her 55 years. this was the first time i tried it...about two months ago?

I smoke some about two to three times a week. can't say i notice any change concerning my migraines. funny, in most of my experiances when there are voices, they're in spanish and the few people i've seen seem to be wearing clothing from old mexico. i'm planning on 5X the next time. oh, do yourself a favor. go out and buy the CD, global house and listen to the second track 'global house.' while on salvia. i guarantee you'll thank me. well, take care all. Peace.</bodytext></report>
