I had been looking foward to trying this material for months, finally found it and took it today after dinner. I was feeling some negative anxiety before taking it because of some problems with my 'friends', (they were spose to meet me but didnt on purpose), which wasnt very nice, so I was a little sad but tryed meditating for a few minutes before hand, to alleviate any of the anxiety.

First alert was noticed at +15mins, was nice for talking but was rather mild, I was really expecting it to be ALOT more like shrooms, had the breathing thing going on but not as much as I thought there would be so we decided to go buy some whip cream. We went to the stream in the woods ajacent to the train tracks (not a good idea) we had 9 cans of whip cream and it was just like getting kicked in the head but in a good way, it was one of the most intense things I've ever done, intense spriling visuals whilst coming off the nitrous, there was a world in there first time in was exactly like this negative reacurring feeling everytime I ever abused duster. Its like a flashback feeling where I'm actually there in the first time I ever did duster in my x-gf's bedroom, I felt like I was there. Second time I was thinking woah this isnt even that good and not a second later I was sitting next to a dumpster then in a false childhood memory of getting punched out while aready on the ground. Then I woke up and realized I was leaning WAY to far over the stream and a train comes out of nowhere and we had to jump out of the way. Then we went back for one more  and this time my friend turned into a dragon and we were like demonic royalty breathing out grey smoke and he had a tounge that was split and 6 inchs long, it was some serious shit.

But then all our sweet sweet air was gone and we were really burnt out and all the magic of the trip was completely gone, we walked around in a haze from the nitrous for a halfhour and after the haze was gone so was the ACO-DET we were basically completely sober.</bodytext></report>
