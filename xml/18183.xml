Having been diagnosed with ADD, and unable to use Ritalin properly without becoming hopelessly addicted, I decided to try alternative methods of medicating myself.

I went to my local health food store, asking for DMAE, and after being questioned as to whether I was a cop (the stuff is illegal to sell in Canada), the guy reached under the counter and pulled out a bottle.

I got home and took a single pill as directed.

Basically, the effects i felt were:
/n
/n
- an unpleasant physical stimulation, like drinking way too much coffee
/n
/n
- slight nausea, chills, and sweating (I presume these are cholinergic side effects, as DMAE is supposed to raise levels of acetylcholine within the brain)
/n
/n
- a general feeling of 'sketchiness' similar to the comedown from MDMA or one of the amphetamines.
/n
/n
It's been three hours since I took the stuff, and the symptoms aren't getting any better.

Thousands of web sites sell this stuff, touting it as a 'smart drug'. I call it a complete waste of money, and will not be repeating this experience.</bodytext></report>
