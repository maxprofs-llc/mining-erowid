I have taken large doses of amt on these meds with no side effects.  Maois are contraindicated with these meds, but I take the risk that alpha-o's maoi effects are slim, if any.

430 pm - dosed 7-8 mg (+/- 2 mg) a,O-DMS in a half empty vitamin capsule along with 75 mg zantac for nausea.
/n
/n
600 pm - nausea sets in and increases up to 630 (T+2h), then fades away as psychic effects set in.  Slight patterning.  Feeling at ease, very much enjoying the company of my friend and his music/singing.

715 pm - I decide this is good but that another 5 mg (+/- 2 mg) could help me get where I wanted.  After dosing, I go out skateboarding to put up flyers for my friends show next week.  Skating feels really fun and I haven't lost much motor control.  After three quarters of an hour, I feel like I have the shits, and bad.  I have to ditch my friends to take care of my body.

815 pm - was sitting on the toilet for a while wondering why I was constipated but I felt like I had to come running to the bathroom like I had the runs.  It turns out that I couldnt go but I was sweating like mad.  I cool myself down by putting my face in front of the air conditioner, and I start to see the most beautiful patterns.  The trees and buildings outside are beautiful.

827 pm - the coming up feels so powerful, akin to the powerful chemical feeling of snorted 5-MeO-DMT.  I take 1.25 mg klonopin to deal with an unexpectedly fried brain.  Some of the things I am seeing:  peace signs and skulls (similar to ones I saw two days ago on dpt), yin and yang, cross of Christ, freemasons symbol, star of David, Pac man ghost.  All of these are in their own spheres radiating out of a center or many centers.  I am still coming up and this is my first time with this drug, so I kindly ask a friend to come over and look after me.
/n
/n
908 pm - I feel like I have overcome the more powerful aspects of the trip, things are looking good now.  Effects are, however, ebbing and flowing, and there is no end in sight for the peak.
/n
/n
930 pm - my friend arrives and I feel great.  I go to a party for the remainder of the night.  Interacting with people is great fun, and I am able to freak some people out.  I get hungry and go out for pizza at 2am with some new friends.  In the restaurant there are swirls everywhere on the walls; everything looks like the sixties.  There was almost no let up in the intensity of the trip.
/n
/n
415 am - I get home and am still tripping quite hard.  I want to go to sleep soon so I take 1.5 mg of klonopin and 75 mg of benadryl.  I lay down on my couch listening to some relaxing music (belle and sebastian) and close my eyes.  I am worried that I won't get to sleep, because I am still tripping so hard.
/n
/n
600 am - I am feeling very sleepy and sedated, though visuals are going strong.  Im sure I fall asleep between 6 and 630.
/n
/n
230 pm - I slept soundly all night (morning/afternoon), but I am still tripping!  I feel exhausted and take a nap for another two hours.
/n
/n
430 pm - wake up and feel a little bit better.  I have to get on a greyhound at 530 so I get my stuff together and make my way to the station.  I am still feeling really out of it.
/n
/n
530 pm - I sleep for about an hour on the bus and visuals are gone by the time I wake up from that nap.  When I wake up, though, I am still exhausted and feel 'trippy.'
/n
/n
1030 pm - go to bed with the assistance of more benadryl and wake up feeling fine.  I can't stop thinking about the trip and its intensity.  I keep staring at walls trying to get them to move.  They don't, and if they do it was only my imagination.

Conclusions:
/n
/n
This drug is awesome!  More powerful than any long-lasting psychedelic I have taken.  Next time I will take probably 9 mg.  12 mg was a little much, and 7 mg didn't get me very far (though I didn't give it more than 3 hours to kick in).  Except for the weird feelings in my bowels, this would be a great party drug.  I also will dose at about 8 am next time.  I have read reports saying that people find it toxic.  I did get a headache at one point, but it was nothing I worried about.  Two Tylenols killed that.  Keep in mind that all kinds of drugs can cause headaches (ex.viagra) and that doesnt necessarily mean that they are toxic.  AMT has nothing on this, except for the fact that amt can be great for mixing with other tryptamines.  I dont think I would mix anything with alpha-o.  I also recommend having some sedatives on hand when experimenting with this chemical (klonopin, valium, ghb, etc.)  I would have had a terrible time if I wasn't able to sleep when I wanted to.</bodytext></report>
