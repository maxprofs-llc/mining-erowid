I have recently found a much easier way to effectively eat the cactus with out tasting its awful bitterness. First I dry my slices of cactus, then cut them into little tiny bits using a weed grinder, and then finally mixing them in with jello. After the jello sets I cut it into small cubes and simply swallow them. The effects are felt fairly quickly, depending on how well I cut up the cactus in the first place. Nausea still comes on after as usual, but with none of the initial taste that is so very very foul. Happy (and tasty) tripping.</bodytext></report>
