I was prescribed Seroquel by a psychiatrist about 8 years ago when I first discovered I was bipolar. After trying just about every psychotropic medication on the market, Seroquel was, thankfully, the one I had been looking for all along. The drug changed my life completely and helps me function normally now.

I was really surprised to read that this stuff is actually used recreationally and has a street value. I am also shocked to see that people are taking as low as 50mg to get high. I take 800mg every single day! I went from sleeping 2-3 hours a night to 12-14 hours a night in just a few weeks. I definitely have incredibly vivid dreams that have me shouting obscenities and other things in my sleep, and even throwing myself out of bed while sleeping. Sounds crazy, but its nothing I can't handle.

Despite the many upsides of this stuff, it most certainly has its downfalls. Once my mind and body got used to a certain dosage, I would feel awful if I take any more than that. I start to feel weird and my brain just flips out for no reason. Every time I take an extra one thinking it will help, I end up a fricking wreck. I do not recommend extreme experimentation with this stuff. I take 155mg of oxycodone a day, and know how shitty it feels to go through narcotic withdrawal. But once I start to withdrawal from Seroquel, I will be begging God to make me a withdrawling opiate addict. Going without Seroquel when my body and mind are used to it is pure hell.</bodytext></report>
