I was given a few of these pills. My friend told me it made him feel 'kind of drunk.' Before today I had not tried this drug alone (I was always on something else). I only had a 5mg pill left so I crushed it up and snorted it. About ten minutes later I could feel something. It just made me happier. It also made my extremities a little numb. It definitely alters your consciousness.</bodytext></report>
