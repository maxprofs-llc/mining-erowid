I would repeat this experience but I would do a few things differently, first off I would take at least 7.5mg, or perhaps 10mg to begin with, then maybe an additional 5, for 12.5 or 15mg. The 7.5mg total I took just wasn't enough.  Second, I would not eat during the experience even if I was very hungry. This drug is more recreational then introspective. No problems of the world going to be solved on Foxy. I don't think it has much therapeutic potential but certainly is an interesting drug. The trip itself was psychedelic like a mild LSD or mushroom experience with MDMA like bursts of euphoria, but instead of gaining clarity I get a little stupid - although this may have been due to the use of cannabis. Senses are enhanced, especially vision.  Body load was noticeable, nervous energy, J reported pressure on her solar plexus much like LSD, which she dislikes. After eating I had severe gut pain, and it felt like gas bloating. Walking around outside was bliss.  We watched a Depeche Mode concert on cable but it didn't sound right.  Talk was easy, but real conversation was difficult.

There was a slight empathetic undertone but not intense like MDMA. I would like to try a higher dose, maybe the much referred to tactile enhancement will show itself over 10mg.</bodytext></report>
