I was placed on Paxil CR for SDD.  After being placed on it my personality changed completely.  I was no longer the person that I once was.  It actually made me more depressed than I have ever been in my entire life.

After remaining on paxil for 3 months I asked my doctor to switch me to Lexapro.  I began to take lexapro 3 days after stopping my dosage of Paxil.  One night I went to go check the mail and received a few bill notices.  So the next thing I knew I was sitting out by a lake, crying, and holding a bottle of Hydrocodone.  I ingested the bottle and went back to the dorm where my room mate saw that there was something wrong with me and called 911.

I was taken by ambulance to the hospital where my stomach was pumped and I was placed in ICU.  I have never had a history of suicidal thoughts or tendencies.  The strange part of the whole overdose was the fact that I felt like it was not me even taking the pills.  It felt like I didnt know what I was doing.  I was killing myself without the presence of fear.</bodytext></report>
