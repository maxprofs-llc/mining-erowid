I have taken MDMA a few times a year and my stutter completely goes away for the duration.  I am not sure if it's because I am at total ease or because it actually does something neurologically, but all I can say is that I don't stutter at all.  Makes me wish I could take a smaller dose regularly just to avoid stuttering.  Though I doubt that is safe, so I won't try it, but I wish the medical profession took a look at this.</bodytext></report>
