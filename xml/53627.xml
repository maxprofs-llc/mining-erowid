It was a bright afternoon on Big Island, Hawaii when my friend called me up. The day had come. I had waited a long 6 months for my friend's San Pedro plant to reach a size that me, and my two friends (which I will name K and J) could use to go on a magical journey. Last time I smoked MJ: three weeks.

But this would not have been my first trip into the unknown. In the past, I've tried Nitrous, Morning Glory and even Marijuana! But even today, when I write this in the year 2005, my first marijuana use (in 2002) was the most intense psychoactive experience I have ever had. One day, I will write a report on it, but it is so hard to put into words. Back to the story. J was the grower and owner of the San Pedro plant which is originally his fathers. 
/n
/n
It was the middle of July. The San Pedro had three 28-30 inch (I measured it) arms coming out of it's base. I already thinking of the perfect setting I choose to do it in: Hawaii Volcano National Park. So, one afternoon, J and I both cut two 28 inch arms off to start the process of preparation. We then laided out the three arms on a table to carefully pull off the outer skin. 
/n
/n
The skin of the SP reminded me of wax paper used for food. We peeled it off, taking us into the night hours of the day. Finally, it was completely peeled off with little if any of the dark green matter that holds the most mescaline missing from the San Pedro. It was midnight, I had to be home to prepare my vehicle for the various things need for a camping 'trip'. It was Friday. Saturday afternoon was the time J, K, and Me all agreed on. 'I'll boil the San Pedro until morning. Do you think that is enough?' J said. I said 'I think so. And don't forget to put lemon juice for taste.' He agreed. 
/n
/n
I quickly went back to my house to pack the stuff for the trip: tent for sleeping, music, consisting of psy-trance, classical, tribal, and New Age CDs, propane stove, and many other things.
/n

Saturday morning. I woke up feeling great. I was excited about the trip. I love the feeling of getting away from civil life to the peaceful place of the wilderness. I ate a healthy breakfast and then headed to Js house to pick him up and his enchanted liquid. J seemed eager to go on the trip as well but for different reasons. This was not J's first time however, so he explained to me what it felt like to him: 'It was like I was Super-Sober, I could think so clearly and I didn't seemed impaired at all. Then I smoked some weed and I was instantly Super-Stoned.' I took his word for it and hoped I receive similar effects. 
/n
/n
K was also there and ready-to-go. We packed the stuff, including the water cooler filled with freshly-boiled San Pedro juice and three jugs. I asked J how long he boiled it: 'About 4 hours', that sound like a good number. But there was one thing was missing, the chronic. J quickly found a dealer and got about an 1/4 an ounce of high-quality marijuana buds. This was perfect, as the night before, I built a Hooka from a Juicy Juice 32 oz. bottle with three long vinyl tubes and a metal plumbing part called a toilet water supply tube that is prefect for home-made bongs. 
/n
/n
The time was around 1:00 p.m., so we headed off. The drive from our town to Hawaii National Park was about 2 hours. Finally we were at the camp site. We quickly made camp and started boiling the juice again because J said it tasted better warm. Using the propane stove, we quickly heated up the juice. 
/n
/n
It was a pretty cool setting as a bunch of guys were drinking beers 30 feet away as 20 feet in the other direction, four pretty women were sun-bathing. It was perfect. After about 20 minutes of setting up and heating the juice, it was time. We all sat around the stove as the hot juice was poured into a small Dixie cup then poured into our mugs. The little cup was used to give all of us the equal amount of dose.
/n
/n
Sacredly, we were in a triangle sitting formation. J, K and Me counted down and then drank up the light-green liquid. At the same time, K and I tried mescaline. It was quite a moment. At the first taste, I thought I was going to gag, as it was extremely bitter. 
/n
/n
'Damn, that's nasty!' I said, I grabbed for a lemon juice container, it seemed to help. 'Hand me that orange' 
/n
/n
J and K did the same. We all took a small gulp while holding the orange. By licking it, the taste wasnt as bad compared to anything else we tried (drinking water and pounding it). The stuff was also kind of thick, but not close to maple syrup thick. Taking turns, K and I found the taste absolutely nasty but J seemed to handle it nicely. What was interesting was that at this point, I was already feeling different. I looked at my stopwatch: 5 minutes had gone by, it was about 2:49. I decided to get up and start walking about. I felt as if I was impaired, sort of a drunken feel. Then I started feeling weird foot sensations, as if I could feel the ground thru my shoes and feel my weight being pulled by the Earth. I was surprised to feel such effects so soon. J and K were feeling similar things too. I took another cup and slowly drank it. I made it my last one because I was afraid of throwing up after drinking to much of the liquid.
/n
/n
I knew we had to get into the forest, and fast. I decided I was too impaired to drive, so I let J drive my car. I popped in a New Age song CD, which had mostly Native American chanting and congo beats. It set the mood quite well. While driving to the entrance, I started think about what J said about 'super-sober'. I started to understand as I watched the road endlessly come toward me as J drove. I felt as if my mind was thinking clearly, but what I saw and heard was distorted. We came to the entrance to the park, but J kept driving. This scared the shit out of me as he usually doesn't do careless things like that. But he quickly reversed to meet the startled park ranger. J said sorry and I paid the fee, then we kept driving. Our first stop was the Thruston Lava Tubes. So we stopped at the Volcano House and decided to walk from there. The hike was about 3 1/2 miles, which was perfect for our journey.
/n
/n
Time: about 3:14 p.m. elasped: around 25 minutes.
/n
/n
We gather the stuff for the hike, including the juice and the home-made hooka w/ weed. I thought of taking a boombox, but I didn't want it to hold me down in the hike, so I left it. We started walking. The views were amazing to look at as they look so surreal to my eye's. After about 8 minutes of traveling on foot on the trail, I found a wooden rest area with a roof. It was right next to this huge drop off and a amazing view of the entire park. I knew it. This was the place where we smoke the weed.
/n
/n
We rested on the benches in this perfect space as I set up the plastic hooka. J loaded the shinny bowl to the top. Gently, we started to inhale the weed for practice. I could taste the weed in the air I breathed in. It tasted so good. The main attraction was about to start. J sparked the lighter, lit the home-made Hooka and smoke began to enter the tubes. I froze for a second as time started to slow down. K looked at me as J looked toward the horizon. Then we exhaled. 
/n
/n
All of a sudden, I started to notice small things in the hut, like this spider web in the corner. It seemed so complicated. Then J ran by me saying 'Wow!' I followed him to look upon the Most Intense Hallucination of the Trip. 
/n
/n
It was a small forest, about 300 feet down. There were trees swaying in every direction. 
/n
/n
I could notice EVERY movement of EVERY tree. It was like I was focused on every tree at the same time. I couldn't believe it. And the sounds: I could hear EVERY bird in that forest, the exact location of where that bird was and the amount of loudness it had in it's voice, independent of each other. I felt like I was not hallucinating, but instead interpreting the world with enhanced senses.
/n
/n
What was funny was that a older man was approaching us as I looked at the Vision and said 'Dude...look at that!'. I wonder if he knew what we were doing. I didn't laugh however as the Vision was just too amazing to find it silly. 
/n
/n
We came back to the hooka to hide it from the old man. He left and we took a few more tokes. I could feel every bit of THC enter my lungs. I packed up the smoke-thru-water filtration system and headed out with J and K. Then the unpleasant feel of the San Pedro juice hit J as he suddenly stop in his tracks to heave. I though he was going to vomit, but lucky he did not. 
/n
/n
K said Are we ready cause I am strapped in and ready to go. Suddenly, we all took off with great speed down the trail. At this point, I felt very energetic as if I could run for miles. As I ran down the trail, the trail seemed to repeat in a pattern of go-straight then go left then go back right. It seemed as if the forest was looping, like the background around me was never going to change. I felt like I was in a Flintstones cartoon with the Barney running against a seamless, continuous background. I would slow down look at the plants around me and they seemed so alien. I thought about how these plants are the only variation on the planet as they have evolved to live on isolated island of Hawaii. I felt like I was in a prehistoric world where, at any moment, I would see an ancient animal come of the forest. But I did not. Oh well.
/n
/n
Time: about 3:50 Elasped Time: seems like forever
/n

On the trail, there was some amazing sights on the edge of the railed cliff. One sight I had was look at a brown cinder cone. It looked as if it was a mound made of dry chocolate, like a chocolate muffin. I could see so much detail in the mountain, like staring at an extremely high-definition picture. It's surface was popping out to me, with 3D effects.
/n
/n
We came to old road that is now a trail and noticed something when we stopped. I stood there as a bird chirped loudly at me from a tree. It seemed as if the sound coming from the bird was passing through my body. The sensation startled me as it felt like I was being pushed by the sound waves. J also experienced this as he was closer to the bird. I can feel the birds voice J said. I knew exactly what he meant. Then, I looked at the ground to watch a bunch ants moving around. 
/n
/n
Then J said Look, they are like a video game. I thought what J meant, and it occurred to me: ants are like pre-programmed machines that are part of a bigger machine of their nest. I thought about how simple they are, and how their behavior is so predictable. K decided to run his foot over the street where they were. They moved it a geometric pattern which seemed oblivious to the ants that died. 
/n
/n
Strange thing life is, I thought. Next to ants, there was a puddle of water. J looked at the reflection of me and said, Look, your flying. I put my arm out and it did look like I was flying as the clouds in the background were passing by. It looked more like a picture than anything else. We were starting to get hungry, so me, K and J started walking back to car.
/n
/n
Time: 4:10 PM Elapsed Time: about 2 hours 20 minutes 
/n
/n
We all made it back to my car and found a sub we brought for the trip. I decided to put on some of my favorite music: psy-trance. After I press play on my cars stereo, J turned it off and said, That music is too crazy I took out the CD and put something in I knew they not be bothered by: classical. The song was Fur Elise by Beethoven. As I listened to the gentle keys of the piano, I enjoyed it a lot more than the intense psy-trance. J made the comment that the song was like a story as it changed paces and moods. K laughed in the back seat saying Wow, this music is amazing. Its giving me all these visuals. I was surprized by Ks words as he usually listens to Death Rock and hardcore music. Maybe the San Pedro was a substance that makes you like gentle music. So, I closed my eyes to see what happening behind my closed eyes. The music made me drift away from my mind, getting lost in the complexity of such a simple song. Colors were swirling around, like a pool of light. Simple shapes popped in and out of my dark world. After the song ended, I decided to drive back to the tent as the effects were wearing off.

This new experience was different than what I expected. I was a little disappointed that it was not more intense, and that the visions only worked after the weed dose. The effects did last for another 2 hours, but they were not very noticeable. I would try this again, only in a higher amount and find someway of taking away the bitter taste of the San Pedro. I have heard of the Native Americans use of SP and how intense their experiences can be. I hope one day, I will have a vision as powerful as the ones Indians have during their Vision Quests. Until then, I will continue to wonder what it would be like to enter the true world of San Pedro.</bodytext></report>
