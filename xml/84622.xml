I have been on methadone maintenance therapy for 3 1/2 years and have been tapering lately. I have gone from 170mg to 40mg by going 5mg per week without any major issues.

Well I know the last few mg's might be difficult and thought some sort of med will be needed to get me the help I might need to relax, sleep and avoid anxiety. I know that Lyrica and Neurontin would be great but I have no insurance. I want to stay away from benzo's, pot and alcohol. So I found some articles about GHB and how GBL and 1,4-butanediol can break down in the liver to form GHB. Well I recieved my order of 2 4oz bottles. The first night I tried just 1ml. Nothing. The next morning 2ml. A little something but not anything noticable. I tried 3ml that night and got a little dizzy. I really didn't like the feeling. It felt like drinking about 4 shots of Vodka and lasted about 1 hour and left. I had an aching gut for the next 2 days and felt worse than before I used it. That's a total of 6ml over 2 days and I really think it's a waste of money.</bodytext></report>
