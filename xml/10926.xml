After 3 days of taking 2 Piracetam per day, I found the following:
/n
/n
1) I did not feel any mental clarity effects / smart-drug effects.
/n
2) I felt much more emotionally stable, to the point where I didn't even want to do any other mood-altering substances - STRANGE.  My mood swings were 'blanded out'.  Sunsets no longer gave me chills of pleasure, but bad things happening did not get me as down, either.
/n
3) I found my memory slightly increased, or at least motivation to remember.  I no longer was as worried about remembering all the things I had to do and all the people I had to call.  This could be placebo, but the effect was quite dramatic in letting me feel 'really on-top of things' even during a move/house remodel/programming work/taking classes.

In an attempt to test for some sort of placebo effect, I stopped taking Piracetam for a month.  The effects (#2 + #3) stopped within 2-3 days.  I began to worry about forgetting things - phone calls, things to do, work assignments, etc.  I found myself writing a lot more down and feeling more like I was 'forgetting' something.  My mood swings slightly increased back to normal levels.

I personally find that Piracetam is very subtle, but definitely has mood and confidence effects.  I feel more 'on top' of it when taking 2 of those orange pills a day.

I think a lot of Piracetam's effects have to do with personality and brain chemical level differences in various people.  I feel like my base personality has more to gain from Piracetam's effects, whereas some more motivated, 'on-top-of-it' friends of mine probably wouldn't even notice a difference.

Just thought I would share, as Piracetam definitely deserves some sort of notice...</bodytext></report>
