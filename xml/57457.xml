At about 3:00pm my friend, who I will call S, and I take 15mg of 2C-I and take a quick trip to the store before it kicks in. I last ate two hours beforehand and S last ate 6 hours before, which probably explains why he felt the effects so much more than I did. We return from the store about a half hour later and proceed to S's room to watch things on google video, I dont remember why for sure. We found some videos about a weird swedish rapper guy and they were really funny, not sure if that was the drug or if they were just stupid.

At around t+0:45 we decide to take a walk to the wooded area/pond/frisbee golf course a few blocks away from S's house. Maybe a few mild effects on the way there, its more fun than normal to jump onto things. When we get there we start to walk around the pond, S says he wants to rest for a bit and I see a big slab of concrete to lay on under a tree. S stands next to it for a while and then decides to lay on it too. I find that it is fun to stare at the tree open-mouthed, but don't see any motion or visuals in it. S on the other hand was seeing the tree sweep its branches wildly trying to 'molest' us, so we promptly moved on. While walking around the pond S is having intense closed eye visuals, and can see himself walking when he closes his eyes.

After completing a ring around the pond we decide to enter the wooded area. I am starting to feel the effects more strongly, but still no visuals. We walk around staring in awe at the trees for a while and S decides that he has found the perfect spot to lay under some trees. I lay down near him and we bond with the trees for a while. I can notice some slight breathing at this point if I stare at the tree long enough, and S is still tripping hard as ever, seeing the branches move all over and the whole tree breathe with him.

We layed there for about 20 minutes, talking about trees and how they can move slowly because they live so much longer, but we move fast because we die so quickly, and also about how trees are happy all the time because they don't have any worries or cares, they can just dance in the wind for their whole life. We also speculated about why plants make drugs, about how when you consume the substances in them it makes you connect to nature and respect it, acting as a sort of roundabout defense mechanism.

The sky was starting to get darker and that means soon it would get cold, and since we could barely make out the temperature we decided to head back to S's house. After passing several 'impossible' obstructions like hills that look like cliffs and stairs that seem far too tall to climb, we arrive at the house. We sit down in the chairs and decide theres no way we could get up, the G force is too incredible.

So we sit there and watch a few episodes of some stupid show on MTV, making fun of everything they do and occasionally laughing hysterically at things that aren't that funny, such as Army commercials and unrealistic plot lines on the show. After about an hour I start to feel cramped and uncomfortable, so I head to S's room to lay down and look at the ceiling, he wants to look at the ceiling too, so he comes with.

We layed there for a little while and discussed the effects we were feeling. I kept having a feeling every once in a while that I was going to die, and S said he was feeling that too. So we decide to take a walk, since we always feel much better tripping outside.

We walked once around the block, talking about things I can't really remember. Then went back inside to use the bathroom and grab sunglasses, since things look cooler when you can barely see them. We went for a bit longer walk this time, crossing the highway and looking at some buildings, but nothing is really as cool as the wooded area, so we head back inside, feeling refreshed.

At this point we are both still feeling it pretty strong, but are starting to come down. We lay in S's room again and talk about various things, how stupid drug laws are and whether we would encourage this to our kids if we ever had them (we decided we would) and probably a lot of other stuff I dont remember. Lots of tactile enhancement at this point, it feels good to hug blankets/pillows, and to play with the wooden swords we found on the floor. At about t+7:15 we decided we were about baseline and S brought me home about an hour later. I went to bed after that and it took about an hour to get to sleep.</bodytext></report>
