Over the last two weeks or so Ive been taking two caps of 300mg St. Johns Wort Extract (.3% Hypericin), along with two 60mg Ginkgo caps for about a week.  While it hasnt made much of a difference in my daily mood other than a bit of anxiety relief from my hectic day-to-day college business (Im usually not too depressed anyway), it has really affected the way my body deals with nicotine.  Id usually get a pretty good buzz from a cigarette at the end of a long day, but now..nothing.  It kinda sucks, because Ive never really smoked much, maybe 2-3 cigarettes a day at most, and have had no intentions of quitting because I really enjoy the occasional cigarette, but now its as if I have no reason to, nor do I want to anymore other than to fulfill the need to have something in my mouth.</bodytext></report>
