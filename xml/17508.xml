I am getting right to the point. I used Calea Zacatchchichi extract with no effects. None, actually I believe it briefly took me off rhythm with my dreams.

I dream nightly, in multiples, and know my dream cycle well.

Maybe it was the extract? However, I did notice how the extract made me feel. Not high or drunk but somewhat herbal in the feeling, mostly in my head. Nothing worth elaborating on. Although the Calea did seem to give me lighter sleep than usual.

I recommend if you have Calea extract put one drop on your tongue. Watch out! The taste is not extremely pungent in the beginning but the bitter, nasty, taste amplifies the longer it sits on your tongue, and have a strong mint ready! I find mint to be the best flavor for neutralizing the effects of this troll feces. As a matter of fact 'Mentos' I now particularly enjoy. Do you remember the Mentos commercials 'The Fresh Maker' you couldn't stomach the commercials let alone the candy, well I have found a use for these nasty candy-isle protrusions.

1. Chew on a Mentos, half chewed
/n
2. Down the Calea juice, one swift drink
/n
3. Have 2-3 more Mentos ready to chew, TRUST ME have them ready, and don't say I didn't warn you!
/n
4. Dont go without Mentos.
/n
5. Don't worry the Mentos will neutralize the effects of the Calea.
/n
6. If going to bed brush your teeth with some mint toothpaste.

Here is a nice anecdote that came with the extract:

In conclusion, I will say that I may try brewing some Calea tea, or possibly smoking some of the herb. The extract did nothing for me and I varied the doses considerably too: less recommended doses to more-than-recommended. I didn't loose much as my dreams are vivid as usual. Recently I bought some Valerian Root extract and find it relaxing, I like it better than the Calea, however no dream amplification with either product. I don't recommend NOT trying Calea however I would recommend brewing some tea or try smoking to notice any effects.</bodytext></report>
