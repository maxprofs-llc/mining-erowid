I'm on 140 mgs of methadone and one day decided to do 5 bags of heroin. I fell asleep at about 1a.m. and woke up at 3:30 a.m. still feeling a little high, nevertheless, I decided to try the Suboxone n8 pill. The worst experience I have ever felt and I've been on methadone for 20 years. I put the pill under my tongue like the guy said. By the way, I did buy it on the street from a complete stranger who told me that the next time, if I even had the smallest urge to do heroin this n8 pill would've cut the craving completely. I thought I was going to die when I took this pill.</bodytext></report>
