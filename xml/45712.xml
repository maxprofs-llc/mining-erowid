I was at my friends house, bored looking for some weed, we decided to scrape out my pipes. We ended up getting only a little bit of resin and we smoked it, got a tiny buzz from it, then we went inside had a smoke and went on the computer. ive tried coleus before and I had 3 dime bags full in my pocket. I gave one to my other friend (we'll call him jojo). He called us on the phone and asked me what the stuff I gave him was, he said he felt really dazed and confused. So then i remembered about the coleus I had in my pocket (it was dried out) and I asked my friend (we'll call her sally) if she wanted to try smoking it. we smoked 2 of the dime bags. it was about 3 bowls each, and then a shared bowl at the end. Sally said she felt really confused and stupid. I went home and went to bed then.

I talked to sally the next day (this morning) and she said that she was havin crazy dreams all night and they were all very realistic, I still havent talked to jojo.

The other times I tried coleus ive tried it with people and most people that ive tried smoking it with have had realistic dreams, and when we woke up we thought that whatever happened in our dreams really happened.
