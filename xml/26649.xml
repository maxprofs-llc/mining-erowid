Quite recently I decided to try something new. Having not got much off of smoking Salvia divinorum I decided to try putting the extract under my tongue. I held it for 5 minutes and then washed it down with a little water. A couple of minutes pass, then WHAM! I noticed intense visual hallucinations, nothing frightening but weird like flies or lines dancing everywhere and blurry faces. I also noticed that my body was sweating and I was light headed. I was also happy and really felt in touch with people.

I went with my friends down to their house and smoked some bud later that day I noticed that although the salvia experience only lasted about 40 minutes and this being a hour later I still felt lightheaded and my pot buzz only lasted about 15 minutes then nothing. I still wonder to this day if Salvia divinorum could effect a marijuana buzz. I recommend this over smoking salvia at least it works better for me and the euphoria from it still lingers to this day many months later.</bodytext></report>
