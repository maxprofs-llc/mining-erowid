My experience with chocolate has been wonderful. It's a great tool for when I need an extra edge to accomplish things. I battle with depression and chocolate sometimes gives me that kick to really get out the door and live my life more.  It makes me feel more confident, and like I can handle much more than I normally can.

I do have a tremendous tolerance for chocolate now, so it is only used occasionally when I feel it can really help me do something. It is definatley a drug like any other, and such an under-rated, but legall and unknown one...

Chocolate gives me clarity. It gives me energy, insight, and inspiration. Everyone I give it to in real life LOVES it. Chocolate nuts are probably one of my most favorite foods now.</bodytext></report>
