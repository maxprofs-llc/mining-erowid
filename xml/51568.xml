About 3 years before my experience, I was prescribed Lexapro (escitalopram) 10mg daily and then bumped up to 20mg daily and tolerated the drug fine. But, I was prescribed it again, and took it one day while I was in Philadelphia. I drove down to my home in Delaware and after about 4 hours, started smoking marijuana. I probably took about 25 hits (I smoked everyday before this).

One of my friends began talking about someone I went to school with who got alcohol poisoning, and it freaked me out very badly. I began getting waves of feeling like I was going to lose consciousness, but eventually sat down and passed out for about 5 seconds. When I woke up, I had a ringing in my ear and could only see silouettes of things. I also had no feeling from my elbows to my hands, but the symptoms eventually went away.

I started having panic attacks after the incident and my psychiatrist advised me to try the Lexapro again. I did about two weeks later at about midnight and had a panic attack with full fledged bad shaking/tremors, very increased heart rate, and trouble breathing. I ended up going to the hospital and getting propranalol (used for blood pressure/anxiety). I had bad panic attacks after this time for a few weeks, up to 20-30 a day. They are better now though and I was prescribed Buspar (Buspirone) and Xanax (Alprazolam) to control my anxiety.</bodytext></report>
