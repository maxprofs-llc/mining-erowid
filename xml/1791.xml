I've had an *overwhelming* reaction to marijuana. I consider myself a fairly heavy user of the herb. But for some reason instead of being high and in the groove, I was having a very bad trip and nausea, no psychedelics involved.

I was at 2 aquaintances' apt with my best friend and his old high school friend. We had smoked some hash I brought from Am'dam, a couple fatties and christened a new glass bong. More than I usually smoke, but nothing I didn't think I could handle.

But then my high became adverse. My body was disassociating. Music was coming out of the ambient white noise. I asked my friends, 'do you hear that beautiful music?' Negative. I was alone. Then the waves of evil started lapping at my feet. The 2 aquaintances took on a new persona. I took on a strange delirium. I believed that the man was satan, and his female roomate was his succubi. Caught in this thought loop, my body would revolt each time I thought about the satan connection. In a sick way, I was really enjoying these stream of evil thoughts, however my body was revolting.

I snuck away to the bathroom because I felt I had to vomit. Dry heaves. I couldn't commit my body to release the evil. I kept thinking of what someone said to me about vomiting as a means of cleansing. More feeble attempts. My friend came in to check on me, and we decided to leave. I made it home and was finally able to release and give in to the vomiting and all was better. Lesson learned, don't fight the urge to spew. Purged and cleansed, I lied on the floor in the darkness, finally able to enjoy the space in my mind. No more bad thoughts. I continued hearing music from white noise and tried my best to remember the melodies so that I could tune in later.

All in all, a new and exciting experience from pot. Never thought it would be possible. Why do I think it happened? I had a large amount of Indian food for lunch, and I think there was a synergy from the spices. Yea, it could be food poisoning, but my girlfriend wasn't sick at all. This experience reinforced my belief that MJ is definitely a visionary plant. I'll probably try to repeat the indian food + copious mj combo just to satisfy my curiosity. However, the taste of curried bile is a poignant reminder that lingers on my tongue.</bodytext></report>
