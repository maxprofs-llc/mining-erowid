It's 8:15 I have about 8-10 leaves drying right now drying with a piece of tinfoil and a candle. Flame is about 8 inches away from tinfoil I got the plants from where I work we have lots of landscaping and tons of different plants that I have planted personally and picked out myself.

12:25 Just drank/ate the rest of the coleeus I didnt count the leaves but it was about 3 good compressed handfuls. I chopped the stuff up as best as I could then added a pint of warm water to it I let it sit for a half hour then I started to drink it when the tea was gone I ate the rest of the leaves with a fork.(I gagged a couple of times those leaves are hairy)..1:02 my stomach seems 'funny' hard to describe.

I have no concentration and the light hurts my eyes...soon to smoke more leaf and some low-grade pot(male flowers) I have opened the wine and soon to drink it with my pot....2:19... 3 glasses of wine (8oz. each)a bowl with half/half of coleus and low-grade pot...mucho buzzz I feel the pot I feel the wine and I also feel the coleus..ive turnwed the light way down and I now have the music channel on..
