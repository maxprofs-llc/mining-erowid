i just snorted a little under a half of an 80mg oxycontin pill.

It's been about 15 minutes and a brief 10 minute walk from the point of insufflation. So I will update this as I feel the drug has 'updated' me.

So far:
/n
/n
8:15 PM (T + :15) - 15 minutes after taking, and I feel floaty yet kind of tired and drowsy. No dizziness, but I feel kind of happy. Nothing seems boring, yet at the same time everything is boring. Kind of hard to concentrate on one thing, and cigarettes are very satisfying. Hard to find words sometimes. Speech is slowed and a LITTLE bit slurred. Pupil dialation so far is NORMAL.
/n

/n
8:21 (T + :21) - Feeling kind of sweaty and a little bit of nausea. not enough to be uncomfortable.
/n
/n
8:23 (T + :23) - I dont usually sweat and I'm breaking into a heavy sweat now.
/n
/n
8:26 (T + :26) - feels very good just to rest. rest my head on the computer desk. 
/n
/n
8:33 (T + :33) - alternating from hating the experience to loving it. sitting with my legs crossed is actually very comfortable. very sweaty now. pupil dialation is normal still. hate thinking.
/n
/n
8:58 (T + :58) - now the experience is somewhat better. I just laid down from last message to this message all the while cutting off circluation to my hand and not knowing it, but I didn't care. I'm starting to like this drug, but it's not one I will do again... well besides the rest of the pill which will either be later tonight or tommorow or sometime when I find pot.

until next time- peace out.</bodytext></report>
