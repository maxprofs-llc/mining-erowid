I used 3 small dried leaves produced by my cuttings in the past months, I hand powdered them and placed in the bowl of a water bong.

To not waste Salvia material (which for me is a scarce commodity) I previously trained myself use the bong by smoking catnip, coleus, mugwort and salvia officinalis (none of them have psychoactive effects anyway). I learned to inspire clean air thru the nostrils just one istant before throat and lungs start to 'burn'. This is how I avoid coughing and thus wasting the precious smoke.

Well, so I hold the flame on the bowl and inspire the white smoke that comes up thru the pipe. I count 20 seconds, exhale and flame again. At the second inhalation, I start to feel the effects. A sense of vertigo, physically impaired, so I put aside the bong and lay in the couch with eyes closed in total relaxation.

I feel a presence of people arriving. Knowing that the trip is about to begin, I ask them to 'take me to a beautiful place'. Usually they arrive marching right to left in my experiences, but this time they marched in circle around me. My eye-closed reality start to melt into a dream, and I am placed in front of a scene from my childhood. They reply 'no, we won't'. Then I ask, 'ok but let X (a friend of mine) come with us' and they reply 'no, he's not coming with us'. So I decided to stop asking things and accept what would happen. Salvia effects increase, vision becomes more vivid and I feel a strong sense of deja-vu, of understanding and of being at home. The deja-vu also includes a feeling a strong love for my parents and my brother which I feel they are someway beside me. Everything has the taste of a dream but I still feel I am awake. The dreamlike scene visually joins with reality morphing dynamically with it but showing definite borders. If I focus on external things (noises or even my own sweating) I loose the vision so I remain perfectly still and eyes closed barely like in the act of visualizing. This I think is the secret when using a such small dose.

The feeling of understanding breaks my mentally created dualisms and everything seems to be true and false at the same time. Meaningless words start to have meaning, and I create new words by joining together other words. Knowing that they would go after salvia experiece, I try to remember one of those words in the attempt to carry it with me into reality. But I forget them, and now I am only able to remember the words '14' and 'fabbisogno' (which now are of course meaningless).

Salvia 'presence' is still revolving around me but slowly. Other peoples from my childhood (relatives and friends) alternates and march around me but I never manage to see them, I just feel their presence.

When one turn around me is completed, the effect of salvia start to fade and the 'presence' change its motion: it turns into an endless road and then fades out completely.

I stay eyes closed for some time and then resume back normal activity. No hangover or whatever.

A great experience for me. It was like jumping back in the past. Amazingly, all our past it's still there, in our minds.</bodytext></report>
