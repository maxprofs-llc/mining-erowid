I have used Ambien on only 3 different occasions (once with alcohol, which was quite stupid.) From my 3rd experience (10-20mg, different doses at different times) with Ambien on, I have experienced mild visual and auditory hallucinations when sober.  The auditory hallucinations consisted of semi-loud beeps and cracks, and ceased a day or so after the high, however, I haven't done Ambien in more than a month, and I still experience visual hallucinations such as seeing translucent/ghostly insects fly past and around me (once I saw a rather large butterfly fly from my knee), as well as kicking something on the ground and realizing that it wasn't real.

Now this isn't exactly inhibiting my daily life in any way, I'd just like to make it known that Ambien isn't exactly a 'harmless' drug.

PS: This doesn't seem to happen to everyone, the guy I did these Ambien with hasn't experienced hallucinations of any kind whatsoever.</bodytext></report>
