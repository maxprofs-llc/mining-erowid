At 4:30 pm this afternoon I was in the same place, doing the same thing I am now -- wasting time fucking around on the internet.  I stumbled across nutmeg and did some research.  Even though  the description said than most of the people that ate nutmeg didn't like it, I found the trip reports to be to the contrary.  Having nothing better to do in these dog-days of summer, and recovering from the previous night's excessive consumption of whiskey, I raided the spice cabinet, and found a brand new, 60 gram bottle of ground nutmeg.   I ate roughly half the bottle then and there, and hung out for a while.

It is now 2:30 am, I've been feeling the nutmeg for about 2 hours.  I find the nutmeg high to be kind of giddy and euphoric, kind of like eating a gram or so of shrooms.  I decided to finish off the bottle -- more on that in another 6 or 7 hours.  Tomorrow should be interesting.   I just found a fairly good-sized roach of some killer indica bud and smoked it all, which equated to about 7 hits, and now, I'm really blazed.  There seems to be a nice synergistic effect between the weed and the nutmeg, sadly I don't have anymore but I might smoke some resin later.

So, Ill tell you a little about myself.  Im a 20 year old college student/musician,

And Ive done just about everything, save for the designer chemicals and hard shit like meth and crack.  Ive tripped on everything but cactus and PCP.  I survived a horrible encounter with datura about a year ago and have since toned down a bit, and no longer mess around with shit like OTCs and sketchy poisonous plants.  The nutmeg is a unique experience, especially with being really blazed, but I have to complain of a slight headache.  Its really fucking with my short term memory, but I dont mind that.  Im gonna smoke a cig and call it a night for now, as its approaching 3 am. At this point in the experience its quite pleasant.

I woke up today at about 3:30 pm, since I didnt fall asleep until about 6 of 7 in the morning.  All last night my mind was racing.  I couldnt stop thinking, which really annoyed me, and my muscles seemed to twitch a lot.  This was unpleasant.  It is now 4:30pm the day after, and I feel pretty much back to normal, except for the sleep deprivation.

My final analysis is that nutmeg didn't do all that much by itself, the actual buzz was barely noticeable.  Smoking some good weed while on nutmeg made it a little more fun.  After the weed wore off it was pretty much just a pain in the ass.  In the end it reminds me a lot of Benadryl --  a cheap, dirty high that lasts too long and doesnt really do much good.</bodytext></report>
