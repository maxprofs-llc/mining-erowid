The events listed happened on new years eve.

The 2CT7 was bought in a smart shop in Holland (at the time of the events it was still legal to posses T7 in the Netherlands, it became illegal a couple of months later).  The little blue box contained 3 blue mystic pills of 10 mg each.  I had snorted half a crushed tablet before and gone to a party without any adverse effects.  In fact, the first time I had taken the T7 I had a wonderful time.

The MDMA was obtained from my regular partner in fine chemicals.  He never ripped me off, he never sold me rubbish.  No difference this time.  I had taken the pills (two double stacked Mitsubishis to be precise) before at a rave too and enjoyed myself.  Although I had to drink a couple of beers to be able to pee (witch was scary at the time). I didnt pay to much attention to it afterwards.

Because I had read so many positive comments about the combination of a hallucinogenic substance with MDMA, I decided to try It myself.  Bad Idea; T7 is not your everyday hallucinogenic.

23:30 	arrived at the party, went to the bathroom and snorted 2.5 mg of T7.  After the pain had subsided - trust me compared to t7, meth doesnt hurt at all - I went to my friends car to snort the other 2.5 mg.  At that time I took one tab of MDMA.  By the time I got back at the party the pain was replaced by a feeling of euphoric enlightenment.  Felt fine until

0:15 The MDMA kicked in.  the effects developed in the following 15 minutes.  The waves of energy had a nasty edge to them that I had never felt before.  In stead of a sense of inner peace an intense restlessness took hold of me.  I couldnt stand to sit down any longer and started wandering around.  When I tried to pee noting came.  I drank enough so this wasnt normal at all.  This time I completely freaked out.  Panic got a hold of me.  I locked myself in the bathroom and tried to but my kidneys wouldnt do their thing.

After a while I got myself together and went downstairs to get some beers.  I swallowed 2 caffeine pills and had 4 beers.  Locked myself up again and waited.  This time a couple of beers werent going to do the trick, this time I was going to die.  But  the diuretics did their job and after half an hour I could pee again.   Actually the beers had taken the edge of the whole experience.  The fear was gone so I decided to drink some more beers.   After about 10 beers I was feeling just perfect, wasnt drunk at all.  Wasnt tripping either.  Just felt fine.

6:00 	I was getting sober again and the restlessness returned.  My muscles were sore and I was shivering.

8:00	Got home and went to bed but I couldnt sleep and lay awake for a couple of hours.

Every time I went to the bathroom in the two weeks following this experience I felt this slight blunt pain in my lower back. I still wonder if it was just the panic or if there was really something wrong with my kidneys that night.  I havent taken any MDMA or T7 since.  I will rather live with the question than die finding out.
