I am 17 years old and have been using drugs for a couple years now: marijuana, acid, mushrooms, MDMA, LSA, cocaine, codiene, DXM, salvia, various prescription drugs etc.

I smoke pot more than anything else. I was recently diagnosed as 'Depressed' and I have found my over all mood to be better during weeks that I smoke more pot, this is including things like my grades being better during months of heavy use. I have stopped most drug use except for the occasional trip or special party. (I do not consider marijuana to be a drug in the causual sense)

My psychiatrist perscribed me Remeron 3 weeks ago. I take 50 mg every night, which is a mid level dose for treating depression. A strange side effect of Remeron is that it causes increase in apetite, which is helpful for me because i was losing weight due to low grade nausea that was never explained by my doctors. It was dismissed as chemical imbalance, somthing to do with my neuron receptors.

I find that the medication causes very vivid dreams every night resulting (at least for me) in a very relaxed deep sleep. I wake up much more energized, at least after the groggyness fades with a warm shower.

The interaction of Remeron with marijuana is an interesting one. My high tends to be much trippier in the visual sense and tends to last longer than a normal high. When ever i smoke high quality bud or hash, i tend to get beautiful closed eye visuals and some mild open eye hallucinations. The only down side is that I usually fall asleep within 30 min.

My mood is at an all time high. The medication seems to affect ones contentment with everything in general as well. It is easy now for me to turn down a drug or even some delicious dessert, I feel more in tune with my body than ever before.</bodytext></report>
