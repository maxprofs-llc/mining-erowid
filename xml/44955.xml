The Setting: My friends B and R were staying at my house for the night. My parents were asleep and my sister was staying at her boyfriend's house. B had stopped by a neighbor's party on the way to my house and smoked a good amount of high quality AK47 bud and was pretty content with himself for the evening. He sadly was unable to obtain any more bud for R or myself. R and I decided to smoke some old 10x amanita muscaria extract resin that I had since we didn't want to spend the night sober in the midst of B whom was greatly enjoying himself.

The amanita resin gave us a pleasant and relaxing buzz. Although it was enjoyable, it was not what I was looking for. I really wanted to have an exciting night. B suggested that I try taking dramamine, since he had heard that it can be quite intense and psychadelic. At first I turned down the idea, but as the night went on, I began to grow curious of the effects. After reading several reports online, my curiousity took hold and I decided that it was time to try it. R and I drove out to the local grocery store and picked up some chips and salsa (as requested by B) and a bottle of dramamine.

The Experience: Upon arrival back at home, I swallowed all twelve 50 mg pills with water, adding up to a total of 600 mg, which I felt would be a good dose. I then continued to read reports on my computer, and within 15 minutes I began to feel some effects. I began feeling my awareness change, similar to the feeling of coming up on pretty much any chemical drug. I decided to join B and R on the couch and watch tv with them. I ate a few chips and sat back to enjoy the movie. I realized that I was growing very tired so I sat back and closed my eyes. What seemed like an hour later (it was probably only a minute or two) I snapped back to reality and my eyes shot open. It was actually very startling and a bit unpleasant. I closed my eyes again, and moments later it happened again. I have never had problems of fear while on any type of drug, and I wouldn't really consider this part of the trip scary, it was just alarming. I would feel very startled and my heart would skip a beat every time I would wake up.

I would also like to note at this point that I was not moving from my position on the couch one bit. My reasoning: I felt as if my whole body weighed hundreds of pounds. My stomach also felt a bit upset, but I don't think this was very much associated to the drug. I decided that I would try to fall asleep and stay asleep for a bit, hoping that this phase of the trip would have passed by the time I awoke. Several minutes later I was torn out of my sleep by the sound of B and R freaking out about something. As they shouted things like 'Eww that's disgusting' and 'What is that!?' I looked at the tv screen. There appeared to be some sort of dark sludge oozing down from the top of the screen. As I tried to figure out what it was, I realized that B and R were shouting about a large centipede on my ceiling. I looked back at the tv screen and realized what I thought was some sort of slime was actually a scene of a cat coming down from the top of the screen in the movie.

At this point, I realized that I need to go to the bathroom, so I mustered up the strength to stand up. This was quite difficult since I felt like I weighed hundreds of pounds at the time. Walking was no easy task either. I kept losing my balance under the enormous weight of my body. I probably looked drunk. Eventually I made it upstairs to the bathroom and back down to my spot on the couch. I had to return to the bathroom several more times throughout the night due to an overactive bladder, which I believe was caused by the dramamine. I continued to fall in and out of sleep, having many vivid and interesting dreams. This is when things really began to get strange.

I started having difficulty telling the difference between things that were really happening and things that I was hallucinating or dreaming. At some point B and R turned off the lights. On several occasions I would be carrying on a conversation with B and R when I would suddenly realizing that it never really happened and that they were fast asleep. Sometimes I couldn't even figure out if I we were actually talking to each other or not. At one point I saw my sister come in through the door leading to the garage, only to see her dissolve into thin air a few moments later (I later learned that she did not come home that night, which means that I had completely imagined that). I don't remember many details about the rest if the night since I was probably asleep most of the time.

Afterwards: The next morning I still felt rather dazed and I could tell that I was not totally baselined yet. I had a pretty moderate hangover for the rest of the day (fatigue, and light nausea and headaches). This was a very interesting drug. I can't really say if was bad or good. I didn't really have fun, but I don't regret doing it. I might try this again someday, but I don't know.</bodytext></report>
