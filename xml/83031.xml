A while back I ordered some dimethocaine. There was not much info on this substance. So I decided to contribute. Preliminary tests proved that intranasally, this substance did feel a lot like cocaine. Mild euphoria and moderate stimulation. It was better than bad cocaine, but not as good as amazing coke.

I decided to see it would replace the speedball. I put the last 150 mgs in solution and added one bag of 'Overdose' brand heroin.

:30 seconds warm feelings, sense of stimulation

:01 realized that there was not going to be a rush or any audio flanging.

:10 On irc, kind of disappointed

:30 Just feeling the heroin.

In conclusion, I feel that dimethocaine was interesting. But not altogether fulfilling. I'd do it again. But I wouldn't go out of my way to.</bodytext></report>
