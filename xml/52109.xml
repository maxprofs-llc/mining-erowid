I have used Kava for years because of it's calming effects but it has recently been pulled from the shelves at GNC centers.

It was suggested by the sales person that I buy GNC brand Valerian Root gel caps 500 mg per. I also purchased some 'Calmtabs' made by 'Good'n'Natural'. Four tablets per dose consist of: 258 mg Valerian Root, 258 mg Passion Flower, 258 mg Celery Seed, 258 mg Catnip Leaf, 130 mg Hops Flower, 130 mg Dried Orange Peel.

I took 5-500 mg gel caps of the Valerian Root - 2500 mg and 4 tablets (one dose) of the Calmtabs - dosages listed above. Dosage was one hour before bed and I washed it down with a diet mountain dew, so you can add caffeine to that list of materials.

20 minutes after the dose, I felt nothing. A slight sleepiness, but I was tired anyway so I don't know if the dose pushed it or not. I was watching television and already relaxed. I didn't notice any additional relaxation. A disturbing side effect was noticed: When I burped, the taste of valerian root in my breath was really nasty.

1 hour after dosing, I was ready for bed. Sleep came quickly, which isn't unusual for me, but what followed was.

I spent the night in some of the most erotic situations imaginable. The dreams were very realistic and extremely sexual in nature. Multiple partners ranged from women I knew well to women I had never seen. The dreams changed often to new situations but would often return to previous ones. I didn't feel as though I ever entered a deep sleep. I always felt that I was on the verge of awakening, the way you feel when you sleep late and you're half awake but way to comfortable to fully awaken. The intercoarse I had in these dreams seemed more realistic than I have ever noted in any other dreams. The detail of the womens bodies was unbelievable. As if I was extremely familiar with all of them.

Throughout the night I would wake briefly when rolling over. I seemed to toss and turn a lot. Not uncomfortably, but as if I would reposition myself at the onset of each new dream sequence. I noticed that I maintained a full erection for the entire night. Every time I surfaced and repositioned I noticed this. Often, when lying on my side or stomach I would awaken from a particularly erotic dream and find myself slowly simulating intercoarse by gently pushing my erect penis against the mattress with my hips and pelvis. It was as if I were acting out the actions of my dreams. This went on for the entire night. There were no 'nocternal emissions' but I was aware of being fully aroused and only (seemingly) gently asleep for the entire night.

I woke with an erection and the dreams quickly faded. My morning feels perfectly normal. I feel rested and calm, but I can still envision those seemingly endless transformations from one wonderfully erotic situation into another. It was a unique dream experience to say the least.</bodytext></report>
