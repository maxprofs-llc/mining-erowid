I just took Ecstacy for the first time a month ago.  The initial sensation was GREAT, but the after effects were not.  About nine hours after taking it, I experienced SEVERE back pain that later radiated to my shoulders and then my legs.  Also, I experienced a total body numbness and burning sensation when i tried to go to sleep ((layed down)).These effects could have been result of my size ((103 lbs, 5'0')).  In addition, it has been an EXTREMELY addictive habit... I have taken it more than 10 times SINCE the first ((one month ago)).  Every time I start to 'come down' I feel a STRONG desire to take more... and then again to diminish the hangover.  Another peculiar effect was that I, who normally have bad vision and wear contact lenses, found myself able to see/read things that I was normally unable to see without my contacts.</bodytext></report>
