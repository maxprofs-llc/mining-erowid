2 days ago my friend gave me a 12 pills of Concerta.  He did not know the exact milligrams of these pills as the outer shell of the pills were somehow removed before he recieved them.  I had never done any type of pills before.  He told me that they would make me feel good and would allow me to concentrate like I wouldn't believe.  He wasn't lying.

It was Thursday, and I had a big test.  I am horrible at tests.  I always go blank.  I thought of the Concerta.  I decided to take 2 of them.  Before I left school I swallowed the 2 pills.  It was on an empty stomach.  By the time I arrived at school, which is a 20 minute ride, I was feeling a lot better than I usually do in the mornings.  I was ready.  I wanted to talk to someone.  I was excited about school and all of the people that I would be able to see throughout the day.  This is very unlike me.

The bell rang and school was in session.  I had a huge test.  English.  I hate English.  The only thing I hate more in school than English class is interpreting poems in English class.  You can guess where this is going.  I had predetermined that I would be getting somewhere around a 50 on it the day before.  The teacher handed out the test.  Long, complicated poems.  The first direction on the test was to give a summary of a random poem.  I looked at the poem and read it.  For once I understood it.  I could concentrate on it for more than 5 seconds to actually read it and understand it.  I am the first one to turn in the test, and I am confident that I did very well.

The next 30 minutes were very boring.  I felt like talking to everyone in the room all at the same time, but I had to keep quiet as I was the only one finished.  The teacher got angry at me because I was fidgeting so much.  He called me over to his desk.  Since I finished so early he had enough time to grade my test. 92. Holy shit!  That is the highest test grade I have made the entire year, and on poetry of all things.

Luckily for me in my next class, we had a subsitute, a very lenient subsitute.  Everyone was allowed to talk. Myself and four other friends made a circle with our desks to play blackjack.  I had so much to say.  Everything I wanted to say had so much meaning.  I had so many words to say, the words that I did get out were jumbled, and didn't make too much sense.  I didn't care.  I was in one of the best moods of my life.  I seemed to be the center of attention for the rest of the class period, which is unusual becuase I usually just listen to what my friends have to say and don't say anything.

My next class is very boring.  I have calmed down a lot.  I am a lot less jittery.  The class is Driver's Ed.  We sit in the library all day while the teacher take one student out at a time to drive.  While in the library we are not allowed to talk, eat, sleep, drink, leave our designated area, and we can only sit two to a table.  Hail Fuhrer!  I just do homework for my English class and my class coming up that was supposed to be done last night.  I get it done suprisingly quick.  I read a book for the rest of the period.  Me... read a book... I must be high.

Lunch.  I'm not hungry at all, so I go outside to the courtyard to talk to my friends and play hackysack.

My next class is pretty fun.  World History.  We started a new chatper, and the entire class period we have discussions.  Something I would usually hate.  I make great points the entire class.  And I feel so confident that I have the balls to make a few jokes too.  Although there is no euphoria like there was in my first class and most of my second class, I still feel wonderful.

School is over.  My friends and I walk home.  They seem to notice something about me, and they mention it, but I say that they seeing things.  Well, I did tell the friend who gave me the pills.  On the way home he told me about snorting them.  He told me to open them up and crush the white and pink parts, and just throw away the green part.  He says that it gives a huge rush.  He compared it to a dilluted version of coke, which he has done in the past.

When I get home, I still feel some of the effects of the pills.  I guess I have no tolerance what-so-ever for methylphenidate.  I do all of the my homework for my history class, which was to write an essay that summarized the entire chapter we went over in class.  It took me 10 minutes. This was a task that would regulary take me 30 or 40 minutes.

Around 5:30, it hits me.  I have a huge headache.  I eat dinner and go to sleep until 8:45.  When I woke up, I was pretty bored.  I see the pills.  I couldn't wait to open those suckers up.  I had never insufflated anything before.  I was very curious.  It turned out to be much harder than it seemed.  When I finally got the second coating off (remember, the shell wasn't there originally) I cut off the green part.  This stuff is a bitch to crush up.  I didn't even think of getting it into a powder. 
/n
/n
Well, I finally got it somewhat crushed up.  I did it at exactly 10:00 so I could keep track of my experience.  It kept getting stuck in my nosehairs.  But I did manage to crush up and snort 2 pills. I could feel it in about 2 minutes.  It made me dizzy.  I was on my bed, and I stood up to get a glass of water, and I had to sit right back down.  The dizzyness goes away, and I feel really good. It was 10:00 by the time I snorted the pills, and by 10:02 I felt it, and by 10:11 I felt really Euphoric.  I was on the internet and typing a million words a minute to anyone who was online.  At around eleven, I started to notice little things out of the corners of my eyes, nothing major, just dots or the like.  And every once and a while I would see lines that looked like when you stare at something bright and then look away to see the outline, except I didn't have to do this.

By 2:30 it had completely worn off and I had a big headache again, and I fell asleep at 3:00.

In summary, 2 pills ingested took around 30 minutes to take effect, and I felt very good, a little euphoric and good about myself, and could easily concentrate for the next 3 hours, and I could, think very well, and felt good self-esteem for the next 6 hours.  With the 2 pills I snorted, the effects took place in about 2 minutes, and I felt very euphoric for the next 3 hours.

I may do this in the future, but only if I really need to be able to concentrate, and I would only do it orally.  This is because the next day I was left with a headache, a sore nose, and a yearning to do more.  Even after one time I wanted to do more, so I can easily see how people can get hooked on this drug.</bodytext></report>
