everytime i smoke more than a bowl, my heart rate increases rapidly as if i had just ran a few laps around the track. my chest tightens and i can feel the blood surging through my body. my chest hurts and sometimes i can feel it pop. it's very odd and scary but, i love smoking grass and i don't want to quit.</bodytext></report>
