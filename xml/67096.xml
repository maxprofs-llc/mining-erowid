I've taken Wellbutrin for two years now (100mg twice daily) and have experienced nothing but good things.  It has eased my depression and anxiety.  What amazes me about Wellbutrin is that it doesn't have the same numbing effect that other antidepressants do.  It actually is an antidepressant.  I also hate smoking now.  I enjoy life more.  I have been able to go on and finish my masters when before I was a total wreck.  Great stuff....now...if only I could get off it.</bodytext></report>
