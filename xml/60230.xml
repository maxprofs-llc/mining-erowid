So I decided to try Blue Lotus, made with wine, since I have read that gives the best results. I took 23g (nearly an ounce) of dried flowers, and mixed them in a food processor with a little bit of white wine. When it turned into a thick mush, I put it on a bottle, and poured the rest of the wine over. I let it stand for 24 hours, shaking often. After 24 hours, I strained it, and squeezed all the wine out of the flowers. I was left with a very nasty looking brownish wine.  I have read that the taste is rather bitter, but mine tastes quite good. It hardly tastes anything at all, actually. I used a white wine 'for beginners', with a very mild taste, so that might be why.

15min: I feel a bit relaxed, but it could very well be the alcohol.

20min: Starting to eat the flowers now. They taste quite good, a bit sour. I suspect they are easier to eat because I had them in the blender.

30min: starting to think it might not work, dont really feel anything besides an almost indiscernible relaxation.

45min: Now I am just really tired. Thats it, I dont have any faith that this will work for me anymore..

1 hour: just drank some coffee with sheridan (15% alcohol) in it, and am not feeling so tired anymore. I might feel something from the lotus, but because I dont even know if it is the lotus or the alcohol, I`ll say it did not work very well, or at least not as expected.

I will try again, but next time I`ll use 50% Nelumbo Nucifera (pink lotus), which I hear has a better effect.</bodytext></report>
