I purchased two bundles of dries poppy pods from a well Known
/n
nursery and crafts store recently, and despite the poppy tea 
/n
methods I've been reading about, it just doesn't appeal to me.
/n
Where codeine extractions from acetamiophen products leaves little
/n
alternative, poppy pods can be dealt with differently. I don't 
/n
like wasting a useful substance... or puking, for that matter.
/n
/n
At least forty pods were crushed and dumped into an electric
/n
fryer pot with enough water to 'float' the matter freely.
/n
Setting the dial never above the highest simmer level, I allowed
/n
the mixture to heat for an hour or so, mixing periodically.
/n
/n
Next, I poured the contents through a strainer into a bowl and then
/n
poured the cleaned liquid back into the fryer and let most of the
/n
water content to simmer away until thick but still pourable.
/n
I carefully poured the extract into a metal measuring cup and 
/n
left it on one of those electric coffee cup warmers until it's
/n
consistancy was gooey, like peanut butter. There was an adequate
/n
amount of nicely dried 'tar' around the surface edges of the
/n
measuring cup to enjoy in a pipe right away. I placed the cup in
/n
a cool place, away from light to let the heavy resin continue to
/n
air-dry. 
/n
/n
A few good pipe hits at a time seems to pleasently relax me. 
/n
I recommend the use of a small butane torch for maximum effects.</bodytext></report>
