I was expecting to feel euphoria after reading other experiences.  I am tense from a general addiction to any drug but I am in a relaxed environment. I take Mirtazapine and Paxil for depression, and I smoke low-grade marijuana at all times. I didn't eat anything prior to taking them if that may have a negative effect I don't know.

My mind is highly resistant to experiencing euphoria, I've determined that benzos are more for relaxation in people that feel all right to begin with. 60 minutes have passed and I feel relaxed but short of being high.</bodytext></report>
