I have an actual prescription for seroquel and do not use it illegally. I have been prescribed an 850 mg dose a day use. My experiences on this drug have not been hallucinogenic or extra sensory in anyway. I don't know if this would be the case for everyone, because I have schitzophrenia and have hallucinations all day long anyhow. This is a powerful sedative, and if I seek sleep, it will definatly work. I find it hard to speak on Seroquel, or I only whisper and I sound odd, shaky, but good. I also have involentary movements very often, and my arms and whole body always feel jumpy. I'm also more paranoid and sad, depressed, but I'm not sure if that's from this drug or not. It stabalizes mood and makes me drowsy. Alot of times, even though I'm jumpy, I feel more relaxed on Seroquel, and I fight with my parents less. It's like I'm too tired to move or I just don't care enough to or something.</bodytext></report>
