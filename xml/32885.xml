this is just to report a possible drug interaction between salvia and mirtazapine (remeron). I smoked salvia while taking remeron at 45mg dose to help me sleep.

The main effects where:
/n
rapid heart beat
/n
heart arrhythmias
/n
a strong feeling of 'buzzing' (sort of like when a body part has fallen asleep and then the blood flow has been allowed back into it) in my hands. this feeling was localized in my hands and was very discomforting. This lasted for the 'peak' of the experience then went away as the salvia decreased.
/n
A bad headache. The blood vessels in my head literally throbbed and I could have taken my pulse from any point on my head. This was rather scary.

Although remeron is a peculiar antidepressant, its main mode of action is the same as most others. I will not be repeating the salvia experience again unless I come off of the remeron. I recommend caution to people on antidepressants who want to try smoking salvia.</bodytext></report>
