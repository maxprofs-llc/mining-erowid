I am 26 years old and have had experience with bupe (2-14mg) for four years on and off.  After having no success with other detox or programs I started bupe in 2001.  After an adjustment period of a few weeks where my head still wanted heroin I then just stopped wanting to get heroin.  The truth is the bupe simply stops my needing and even wanting to get stoned.

I still believe now what I did then that bupe is a miracle. With a little effort bupe can be a catalyst to a good life.  The withdrawal from bupe is not hard and certainly  not worse that heroin and nothing compared to methadone.  After one year of bupe at 10mg daily I found the detox only took 3 days and then I was fine, quicker and easier than heroin.  My problem has been that I kept stopping the bupe and going back to using because I'm greedy.  But I have just done yet another bupe detox and right now am not using.</bodytext></report>
