Today I acquired a few ultracet pills. I did a little research on the net and decided on an dose of two pills. This yields a total dose of 75 mg tramadol/650 mg acetaminophen. The cannabis I had was a very high grade hydro. I'm unsure of the exact strain, but it is very good. Like you haven't heard that before.

I think I start to feel something other than the weed. A little bit opiate in nature but definitely something else to it. I feel quite alert.

Not quite sure I've hit the plateau because it keeps getting hard to type. Excellent euphoric body sensations. The torso feels so light.

Weed definately amplifies the action of this drug. I did not feel any of the nausea that others have reported with this drug. I also feel 'speedy' as others have reported but I have noticed this with opiates antagonist drugs ( oxycoden, hydracoden, codine, etc. ). B+ combo. A little short lived for my taste, but to be expected considering the ingredients.</bodytext></report>
