After a craniotomy for a brain tumor, my neurosurgeon prescribed dilantin to prevent seizures. I had no serious documented side-effects, but I was on the medication for less than 6 mo.

I asked my doctor to wean me off of dilantin because of the effects on my emotions (or lack of). I essentially felt nothing. I couldn't feel happy, I couldn't feel sad. There was no anxiety, joy, fear, contentment, nothing. Sex didn't even feel.
/n
I didn't feel bad. I just didn't feel.
/n
A week or so after being off the drug I was back to normal.

Feeling bad, sad, anxious, etc. is better than feeling nothing.</bodytext></report>
