I had experiences with cigars and such and had learned to inhale smoke by accidentally doing so with cigars.  One day when I was 16 or so, I decided to try a cigarette finally.  I went outside my house and smoked one full flavor camel unfiltered cigarette.  I coughed a few times while trying to smoke it, but I smoked the entire cigarette.  Then I progressed inside and suddenly felt really light-headed, dizzy and tired.  Then I laid down on the ground and passed out for a few minutes, for I just remember getting up a few minutes later.  This was my first experience with any type of substance, and I was amazed at how strong cigarettes are.  I have been on again/off again smoker for 6 years now.  I'll never forget the first time I had a cigarette though, it was definitely stronger than I thought.</bodytext></report>
