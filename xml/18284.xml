I took about 1mg of scopolamine Hbr. After about 30min my heart began pounding very rapidly. At that point, I was scared. Minutes past by, and hallucinations began to appear especially when I began to nod off in a pleasant state of drowsiness. The drowsiness is different than the way narcotics or opiates produce. It was more of a wake and sleep patterns with auditory and visual hallucinations. The hallucinations were not the kind what LSD, mescaline, or psilocybin does. These were more less intense and not colorful. I began drooling and when my eyes were halfway open I saw this grosteque creature. But when my unconcious state began to arouse it had dissapeared.</bodytext></report>
