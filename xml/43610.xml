Well last night was prom at my school and to stay awake all night without doing uppers I decided to drink the Molson kick beer, which contains about 3g of guarana per bottle. So in all I took in about 18 grams of this shit and man does it get you fucked! I was soo wired all night even though I had to walk for an hour to get to the party, which didn't start till 1:00 or so, I was grinding my teeth and talking codshit to strangers all night. It was almost hallucinogenic, like MDMA, but it kept me up until at least 6:00. I did do a small line of coke which didn't do too much seeing as I was already fucked.. All in all it was totally worth it if you'd rather drink to stay awake than sniff a bunch of lines of drop a couple pills.</bodytext></report>
