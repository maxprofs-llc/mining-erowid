So I have taken Marinol a couple of times recently. I keep hearing people say its not that good compared to weed.

11:00 pm - I took 10mg on an empty stomach.

11:30 pm - I felt a little high so I took another.

11:45 pm - Holy crap I was high. It was amazing. The high was better than any I had from smoking and I didnt smell like pot, which I thought was a great plus.

12:00 am - I  got incredibly hungry and the worst dry mouth ever.

My high lasted until around 2 or 3. Was an amazing experience.</bodytext></report>
