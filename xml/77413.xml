On a road trip to Vegas I took some Provigil to stay frosty. This is a non amphetamine stimulant for shift workers and narcoleptics. After six hours, once I arrived at the hotel, I took 75 mics of acid.  /n  I usually take 100 but didn't want to go too far down the rabbit hole. I guess I still had a little pro-v onboard because I noticed a lot of visuals, much more than I would have expected. I felt really nervous for about 2 hours before I settled into what would have been a normal trip.  Each time I've used these together I would say it increased the intensity of the trip by 50% and the duration by 30%.  I did not find it to be a pleasant experience and would not recommend it. These two drugs should probably not be taken in the same day; it is too hard to tell when the Provigil has worn off.</bodytext></report>
