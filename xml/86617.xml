I just took a trip with 150 or so mg of 4 aco DMT.  I literally think I almost died.  Took it at 5:30pm.  Half an hour or more in I was getting some visuals, though really not that intense or even very good.  I started to get anxiety and feel nauseous/sick.  I was outside walking around.  I managed to make it home luckily.  On the walk back I felt odd sensations in my body that were likely not good.  When I got home I was pretty sure I was gonna die.  I lay in bed for a bit.  The trip/sick like feeling started to subside a bit.  I managed to sit up and go to sit on the toilet.  I then started to feel very high pressure in the blood vessels of the upper left of my body.  I lay back down in bed and stayed awake for the next couple hours feeling high pressure in my heart and vessels through out my body.  It really could have been a heart attack or something similiar?  Even today, the day after I feel having a physical feeling of general weakness in my chest/heart.

This drug really is more of a poison than a psychedelic.  Generally weak visuals, really messed with my blood pressure and heart.  I would recommend people stay away from it. By the way I took the high dose because the previous two days I had taken about 40-50 mg with little effect.  This was a 250 mg bag that is now all gone.</bodytext></report>
