Set &amp; Setting
/n
/n
Solo, at Home - just woken up, ready to seriously do some internal explorations (extrusion in hyperspace, maybe?)
/n
/n
[an account of mixed thoughts written during the trip and other comments further added]
/n
/n
(T-0:0 min): Harmala, a teaspoon of powdered S.Rue
/n
/n
(T-0:25): 1 Hoffman blotter
/n
/n
(T+0:30): somethings happening ? acid, nope... the harmala :)
/n
/n
(T+0:50): thoughts accelerating and smiling :)
/n
/n
(T+1:15): transitional period. flow of information ...'you're coming on strong and i like the way, the visions we've had ... are part of the way
/n
i'm telling you now i'm here to stay the hard way'
/n
/n
(T+1:25) hard way, synaesthesia ... (between) Patterns appear around ... colours are glowing - I can hear a melody of sorts, two notes. I try playing them and figure them out... I decide not to listen to music and definitely engage in a McKenna style, pitch black room, alone trip. 
/n
/n
The small space in the darkness starts to look like a definite place in hyperspace - like a cave of sorts. Slowly, but surely, a 'vacuum cleaner' appears in front of me, an entity of sorts - Cascade style - ball with loong tentacles, somehow wired up into my head. It's a 'huge evergrowing pulsating brain' which tells me that it loves me, that 'all you need is love' and that it's here to bring good. I am totally stunned and BELIEVE this. I wonder if it'll appear outside of this space and venture out - sure enough, on a wall in front of me, I can see it mapped on to the texture - it's tentacles floating in hyperspace and connecting to my mind. I then go under a blanket, again - in darkness, it appears - it is here, I know it and I can sense it will somehow always be with me...
/n
/n
Further, I go sit before my window and look at the snow on the roof - it textures all over, letters, somehow wrapped in a circling pattern appear. The curves in the uneven texture appear like curves of the brain...
/n
The air seems heavy &amp; thick, with a glow on it...
/n
/n
Strings on blankets appear alive and moving, like small tentacles drifting in a sea of air
/n
/n
(T+3:25) weird, exactly 9:20 ... ;-) ... 3 hours since the beginning. i still feel like i have made contact with a strange entity from another dimension ... a dimension of (linguistic) ideas ... the more i let go, the more obvoius it looks like ... everything looks like it's from the dimmension of thoughts.
/n
/n
... i am sure it's hard reading me ;-) but stick around ...
/n

(T+3:55) Weird things are happening here, it's best to come and see them. .. the next time i'll sort the flow of thoughts in a muuuuch better way! ;-)
/n
/n
the circle will be smaller, with more cultural influences  :)
/n
/n
(T+4:05) when i looked it was 10:00, when i started writing it was 10:01, while writing it was 10:02 and when i finished it was 10:03 ... 
/n
you cannot win ;-) the system in the game it plays unless you can
/n
sting it, shake it like nobody expects (thoughts about The System - i can experience it - i am the System, the System is all around us (think, the Mattrix)
/n
/n
(T+4:57) still more madness (System examining) ... i don't wanna write :) it's that good
/n
/n
(T+9h) smoke dope ... full time back in to the System
/n
/n
(T+?h) there are now other entities. plastikman style skeletons with wicked grins, think there are two of them, facing each other - i associate them with weed. i have seen them before, but now i am totally sure they exist. are these some of the entities McKenna talks about ? i think so - maybe a lot of people 'get them', but they don't know ?
/n
/n
(T+15h) still more weird stuff, everythings weird and i can still surf the noise of the system - the noise btw seems to rise and fall in pitch, and go into weird flangers and wobbles. have you heard the end (-0:10s) of A Study of Six Guitars and the beginning of Snake Hips from ISDN - very much the sound of it!!! 
/n
/n
(T+20h) light a small spliff, then another one (nail size) and put on my headphones with ISDN on - and fall asleep.
/n
/n
(T+31h) I awake, totally refreshed, new &amp; nice feeling - ready for life. all my realizations are still with me and i can still relate to them. a mind blowingly wonderful trip... i have tried before Harmala + LSD (and LSA) and I can tell it's a really nice one. Just be sure to have an empty stomach at least 6-7 hours and be sure avoid hard food before.
