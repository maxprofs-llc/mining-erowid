What can I say, one night I got bored and decided to try smoking catnip, because I've heard a little about it. So I sat down in my smoking spot, smoked 5 bowls straight. The taste of the smoke wasnt too bad, and within a few minutes, i felt pleasantly intoxicated, almost like i had smoked a bowl of marijuana.Then, I smoked a cigarrette, which I've heard prolongs the effect. For the next two hours, i felt light, pleasant, and relaxed. It was a very positive experience. What it lacks in potency it makes up for in cost and availability.</bodytext></report>
