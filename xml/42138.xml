Last night my friends and  I took somewhere from 3.5 to 4.5 mgs of DOI. Our plan was to go hang out at our friends farm where we would have a peaceful, happy, non-stressful experience.  Myself and one other friend of mine both swallowed the DOI on the carride over. I first noticed effects in about 45 minutes to an hour, mostly just general feelings one would be having. From then the substance got nothing but stronger for the next I would say 7 or 8 hours and then just gradually shifted off. Very stimulating at times, yet very psychedelic as well. A lot of drum banging went on to release extra energy. I would not say that this substance lasts 30 hours. If anything it may have a RECOVERY period of a good 10 hours, but nothing real intense.  It was 11:00 p.m. when I ate the stuff and I was baseline at about noon, so its not really all that long. Good stuff for long parties and events that last long. One more thing I would like to note is that even though this drug is significantly long, it seems like it would be a very friendly drug to people who are not so familiar with drugs.

I had very little negative effects the whole time i was on this drug, as opposed to the ups and downs of LSD it was very much just up.</bodytext></report>
