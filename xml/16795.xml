I had heard of yohimbe for many years but had never had a chance to try it. A friend had often spoken with me about using a tincture form of yohimbe in coffee and enjoying it's mild psychedelic effects. While shopping for some vitamins I noticed a major supplement manufacturer had begun selling powdered yohimbe bark in capsules.  It was not expensive and after some research on the internet I decided to buy a bottle of the 500 mg capsules.

The recommended dosage on the bottle indicated taking one capsule after a meal up to three times a day.  No claims of any effects or benefits were listed on the bottle.  My research on the internet seemed to indicate that it was currently being touted as a 'fat burner' in addition to it's well known effects as an 'herbal viagra'. I decided to try it gradually starting at the recommended dosage and increasing gradually and trying different methods of ingestion once I was confident I was getting no bad effects.

The first day I took three capsules throughout the day and noticed no effects at all.  I doubled the dosage on the second day and noticed only a mild euphoric mood starting in the late afternoon and had a little trouble getting to sleep.  The third day I took three capsules in the morning and began to notice very mild effects in a little over an hour. I decided to try the rest of the dosage I was planning to take that day in the form of a tea which I made by dumping the six capsules (three grams of powdered bark) in a Pyrex measuring cup with about eight ounces of boiling water, 1000 mg of vitamin C and simmering over low heat for about 20 minutes.  I filtered the tea through a coffee filter and added a couple of ice cubes to cool it down. I drank it gradually over a period of about 45 minutes mixed about half and half with

coca cola on ice (not terrible tasting but not great either).

Within about ten or fifteen minutes of begining to drink the tea I began to experience a more intense effect of stimulation and euphoria.  This increased over a period of about an hour.  I found the effects to be enjoyable but rather mild, slight tingling, especially in the limbs, very subtle tracer smearing visually, rather like pot but with a more alert type of euphoria.  My heartbeat seem to be a little elavated but not at a level of discomfort or concern.

At this time I decided to try smoking a small amount of the powdered bark to see what effect it might have on the experience.  I smoked probably only 50-75 mg sprinkled over some shake from some pot.   The effects were immediately intesified and began to become much speedier and psychedelic. Colors seemed brighter and often left afterimages.

At this point I also began to notice the sexual effects, I began to feel mildly aroused.  Masturbation was quite enjoyable and orgasm was prolonged and intense.  The overall effects seemed to gradually decrease over a period of around five or six hours.  After this amount of time I felt a little tired and decided to take a short nap, I ended up sleeping for nearly six hours.

I have since tried yohimbe both as tea and smoked on at least three different occasions.  I have come to the conclusion that smoking is both easier and much more effective.  An effective dose for smoking is only about 100-150 mg where tea requires at least three grams for even a mild experience.  Mixing the yohimbe with a small amount of pot seems to enhance the psychedelic edge and tone down the speediness of the experience.  One consistant effect I have noticed is the burn out after coming down, I lay down for a short nap and end up sleeping for at least four to six hours.</bodytext></report>
