I have had a lot of experience with alcohol and marijuana. I have used Ketamine, Lsa, cocaine, lsd, mushrooms, and loads of pills.

I recently saw a bottle of sake (rice wine) in my house. I poured around 5-6 oz in a glass cup. Then I put it in the microwave for around 45 seconds. When it came out of the microwave it was pretty hot. I ingested the liquid at 4:30pm
/n
/n
4:30: Just finished the hot sake
/n
/n
4:35: Small buzz but I thought it might have been a placebo
/n
/n
4:40: Feeling really good 
/n
/n
4:45: Have a kickass high. Really strong buzz.
/n
/n
5:00: The buzz/high is starting to wear off.
/n
/n
5:30: Effects fully gone
/n
/n
End result: Hot sake's effects kick in almost instantly but do wear off way faster then hard alcohol.</bodytext></report>
