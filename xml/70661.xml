I was planning to head to a small gathering with some friends I didnt know too well, but with whom I had at least been acquainted since the beginning of the school year. It was after a much larger party at Reed College, and everyone was dressed up and ready to start drinking after a fun and raucous night. I wasnt looking to drink due to antibiotics I was on, so I decided to create my own crazy time that night by insufflating some 2C-B that I had just bought. I had done it before, both orally and by insufflation, at 20 mgs, but my dealer assured me that 40 would be okay orally, and I assumed that meant I could also snort it.

I went to my apartment, with the plan to go back to the dorm after I did the drug to meet my friends. The apartment is a two-minute drive from the dorm, so I snorted it, literally ran to my car, and sped to the dorm. During the drive, my face was burning and I continued to sneeze and cough, but there were no effects of the drug so far. When I arrived at the dorms parking lot, the drug hit me instantly, and I parked as quickly as possible and got out of the car. /n

That was when it started to really affect me. My pupils began to dilate, creating the illusion that everything was moving. I was able to walk to the dorm, meanwhile hearing echoes of voices all around me from the various people that I saw on the walk to the dorm. When I arrived at my destination, the door was locked. I knew I needed to knock, so I did, and I was let in, barely managing to croak out a thank you.

Instantly, my friends asked if I was okay. I managed to stammer out 2C-B, and then the night started. I remember feelings of my face burning and an overwhelming feeling of nausea. As I sat down, I began to puke. And let me tell you, I now know what puke my guts out means, because that is exactly what I did. And puking on hallucinogens is interesting, because, as I so eloquently said I am nothing in my stomach and I am being puked out. In other words, I took a trip to being my stomach and physically hallucinated being vomited.

After the overwhelming nausea, which lasted about 20-30 minutes, I was taken out to a quieter hallway where I sat calmly with my friend. The whole time, I was seeing my world in blurred motion, and I was unable to focus on any one thing for more than a few seconds. The world was reduced to fractal patterns and all sounds echoed, quite literally like in the Yellow Submarine. Perhaps the most amazing thing of the trip was I had absolutely no idea what reality was. I couldnt pin down my life at all, as in I couldnt identify what I would wake up to in the morning, I couldnt understand what a duty or chore was, I couldnt understand where exactly I was, and I couldnt identify what my goals or desires truly were.

A lot of my friends were quite drunk, and I couldnt really remember what was appropriate behavior for a drunk individual and what was appropriate behavior in general. Also, all dimensions were morphed, and let me tell you, the word morphed does not do the drug justice. I couldnt tell the difference between the distance to the nearest tree and the degree of friendship I shared with the person sitting next to me. Another interesting effect was on how I thought I should respond to social situations. I knew what was funny, but I didnt really know what my own sense of humor was and what little humor nuances I wanted to display. 
/n

After about an hour, I started to calm down as I began to grasp reality a little more firmly. Let it be noted, that this whole time I was a little frightened, but nothing to the point that I wanted it to stop. The only reason I wanted it to stop was because I realized I was being an imposition on my friends. But overall, I was having a pretty great time. Rumors were beginning to spread around the dorm about the girl on too much drug and people began walking in and out of my vision to observe the girl who reportedly puked everywhere. I was able to raise my hand and point out that the notorious girl was I, but I still focused on several key people who were standing there talking to me and continued my conversations with them.

It was reported that I was very contained at this point, but I didnt really feel like that at all. The fractal patterns were continuing, as well as the echoing sounds, and I pointed out several times that I get the Beatles. I also said I understand what the drugs did to them, but I didnt get why they would want to do these drugs more than once. My view of that definitely changed as the night wore on.

About two hours into my trip, I was enjoying myself immensely. The nausea had ceased, and I was starting to just relax into the visuals and sounds. Various people left, but it was important that I at least had one person with me at all times that was focused on me and talking to me. I was able to describe my experiences a little more than I was earlier at this point, but I was still lost in my own mind just amazed at how altered reality was. All dimensions were still morphed to me, and I found myself thinking about one thing for an extended period of time, then blurting out a conclusion, only to be distracted and lose my train of thought before I could actually announce what I was trying to iterate.

Three hours into the trip, the drug was definitely still present, but much less intense. I was able to joke around with friends, drink some water, and get a sense of bearing, both physically and temporally. The come down is great, as I didnt really feel a come down at all, rather a gentle and slow down. While I was slightly let down that everything was stopping, I realized that I wanted to be off the drug to reflect on what Id been through, so I welcomed this slowing without any of the comedown effects I tend to get on cocaine and amphetamines.

By four hours, I was almost completely sober and able to walk and talk and head to the opening of 4/20, a large party at Reed College. I didnt partake in any marijuana, but I had no desire, as I simply wanted to reflect on the nights experiences.

Overall, this drug is fantastic. I consider myself a changed woman, as it showed me that reality is not something at all set in stone, and that the world is a complicated place with many dimensions to be analyzed. Compared to my experiences with 20 mg, snorting 40 was life altering, where 20 I could do almost any weekend as a low-key recreational drug.  2C-B at higher doses is a mind bender to say the least, and I wont be doing it again tomorrow, but I would definitely consider it for sometime in the future.</bodytext></report>
