I have been using opioids off and on for 4 years now. I guess you can say I'm an addict. It started with using narcotics(pain killers) for a slipped disk and sciatica(pain down one or both legs), and migraines. With Tramadol, the effects are similar to the Hydrocodone,Oxycodone,Morphine,etc, but I don't really get a high.

Also I don't get itchy; maybe a little nausea, but that can be alleviated by laying down. Right now I get them from the Net by prescription, which for now is perfectly legal, but expensive, a 30 pill 'script would be around $70. They can make me rather tired and loopy, and I really don't feel any kind of a high. Also, they can give me a low grade headache if I take too many at one time. Right now I'm using them to wean myself off of narcotics for good, for I see no future in my continuing using them.</bodytext></report>
