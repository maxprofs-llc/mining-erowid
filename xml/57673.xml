I have recently bought 2-AI from an online vendor. After purchasing I read some fairly negative reports on it so felt a little disappointed in anticipation. Thankfully the reports appear to be unduly unappreciative.

I have found it to be effective, enjoyable and economical. The first gram was shared between four friends over two occasions. Each had three lines at each session (30 lines from a gram!) We were all also drinking beer and playing cards. We insufflated the 2-AI which is fairly painful, but far from unbearable. The initial effects consist of euphoria, loquacity and  a pleasant warm body load, a little like mdma. This lasts for about half an hour or so then tapers off un-noticeably. Doubling the size of a line made the somatic feelings very pleasant but very intense with a corresponding warm sluggishness of mind. Strangely, this two high dose pushed me over into a dreamy almost opiate reverie, I then drifted off to sleep. So, no problems with insomnia! I think it improved my card playing, but it's hard to tell - I am pretty good.

No significant hang-over the following day. Nostril uncomfortable. Amongst the reports I read, certain addled old junkies sagely recommended shooting it up or administering it via enema.  I'm sure they're right, but it might result in a slightly strained atmosphere around the card table.</bodytext></report>
