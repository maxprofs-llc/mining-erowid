I was diagnosed with MS a few years ago and waking up and just living life is an exhaustive task.  I've asked doctors what I can take for more pep and they've all said the same thing: coffee and exercise.

I've done that.  Caffeine makes me nauseated and exercise has helped me lose 40 pounds - but still leaves me tired. I did my own research and found that Modafinil is an off-label medication for MS.  I asked my doctor about it and he refused to prescribe it because many people are abusing it.  Disheartened, I went online and bought it from India.

After a week of taking 200mg every morning I cannot begin to express how much this medication has helped.  I wake up feeling normal for once instead of depressed and drag-ass tired.  I'm not high - I can't go and run a marathon - but I can FUNCTION.

Yet doctors are hesitant to prescribe it because a lot of kids are trying to use it like coke or as a study aide.  So, please...if you want to get high please leave this medication alone.  The abuse is just making it hard for people that legitimately need it.</bodytext></report>
