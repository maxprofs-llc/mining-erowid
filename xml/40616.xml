A friend called daeva showed me how to prepare this delicacy...somewhat resembling a giant onion..with fans above the ground, it was used as an arrow poison in former times. Contains many carcinogenic chemicals that if not prepared correctly can be fatal. Well any way cut up like normal onion discarding outer husks, fans, and roots. Filled pot with water and boiled then refilled and boiled 7 times. Once done cooled in fridge.

Then drank half litre and chewed few spoons worth of the solid stuff. Became very energetic, swimming like a serpent in the pool walking on hot coals then lights surfounded by halos seeming angels merged into the backround. inner vision 'as if eyes fixed on another world' hearing high sounds hauwwwww etc, hard to explain experience yet did not sleep and felt well.

First time I ingested this flew in my dreams to a hotel filled with fluffy shiny rooms ....yet this time much mellower yet intense.</bodytext></report>
