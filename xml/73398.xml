I just wanted to say that I have taken many drug tests in the past while on DXM without a hitch.  When I say 'on DXM', I mean that I had dosed about an hour and a half to two hours before the test.

I have one of the tests and it said that the following were tested for:
/n
Cocaine
/n
Marijuana
/n
Opiates/Morphine
/n
Amphetamines
/n
Methamphetamine
/n
Phencyclidine
/n
Benzodiazepine
/n
Barbituate
/n
Oxycodone
/n
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine

It was a urine test done in a lab.

Tolerance MAY be an issue.  I had been taking DXM fairly regularly for approximately four years.  DXM is great.  It drains my soul, but it's fun at the time!</bodytext></report>
