I recently purchased about 100 generic valiums (10mg) online. After three weeks of somewhat patient, well not really, waiting, they finally arrived. So, with great excitement, I opened the pack and took one right off the bat to properly test it. I noted some slight euphoria after ten minutes, but it seemed to pass just as soon as it came. No big deal, I thought, just too small a dose. After all, it was just a test run to make sure I hadn't been burned. So I took three more. Same exact thing, ten minutes of slight euphoria and an abrupt ending. I did note a feeling of exhaustion afterwards however, so I decided to sleep it off and try again later. However, and this is the weird part.

The next day, without taking any whatsoever, I noticed that while I had no physical buzz of any kind, I was having some difficulty walking, as well as slurred speech. This was pointed out by a co-worker. So no pills the next night at least I decided as a result of my obvious concern with the occurrence. However, the following morning, I had this newly found zombie-like state, like being medicated in a mental ward, complete with the previous walking and talking issues all night and into the next morning. All this from 40 mg three days prior.

I mentioned this to a friend of mine, We'll call him B, and for whatever reason he wanted to try some. So I gave him twenty mg. He said he reacted just as he expected, fucked up and happy. Oh well, I'll sell some to B and did notice that they may be useful as sleep aids in smaller doses.</bodytext></report>
