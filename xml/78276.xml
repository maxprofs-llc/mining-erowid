It makes you feel perfect. They say.
/n
They say, It makes you pick that expressionless
/n
nodding head up off of the cement and view
/n
Nature. See the wonders of the world unfurl
/n
before your very eyes in the pattern we call fate.
/n
They beckon, Come with us. In the world where
/n
wild fields of poppy bloom. Where the mystical 
/n
pot plant grows in the wild, dripping with fresh
/n
honey-like residew.
/n
/n
But have you all missed for sure the intense heart beats?
/n
The ghastly-white clouds blown out of your mouth 
/n
like your spirit screaming for escape?
/n
Have you missed the opressions? Depressions?
/n
Soul sessions?
/n
Have you missed life as we know it? (Melting into 
/n
the past, future, and never the moment?)
/n
Have you missed the restrictions? Addictions?
/n
Crucifixions?
/n
The butt-naked bluesy beats of the blacks?
/n
Wondering why they would write of which?
/n
/n
I know I have.
/n
And like a vodka-drunken schoolgirl, 
/n
I cant help but to say
/n
that Im loving every minute of it.</bodytext></report>
