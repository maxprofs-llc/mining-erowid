So, in my never ending quest to find other things to occupy my mind with, I happened upon many reports of a 'Wild Lettuce Opium'.  Now, I have seen the 'Budz' and other such clones and hybrids of this stuff, even tried a few but to no avail.  It was hard to tell if we were dizzy from smoke inhalation or from an actual effect of the substance.  Then I discovered a place where I can order pretty high potency extracts of the Lettuce.  So, I ordered some.(Hey for $6.50 a gram it seemed like an acceptable loss even if it sucked.)

We the other day my package arrived with a little baggie containing an almost hash-like substance that was hard, a medium shade of brown, and not sticky or greasy like I had imagined.  It was a lot like marijuana resin from the bowl of a well used  pipe.  Anxious to try it out, I pulled off a little piece maybe the size of a pea and put it into a regular glass bowl.

I flamed it directly, it took a few seconds of direct heat to get burning, once it was going I drew in a hit.  It was smooth and easy to manage in my lungs.  I took a few hits from the pipe one after the next, until the little pea was just an ash.  I sat back and waited for five minutes.  Nothing really obvious at this point, so I decided to try another little piece.

Same process, about a pea sized piece, smoked down in a few back to back hits, sat back for a few minutes.  Still, apparently nothing.  I got up and decided to walk home (I have stuff shipped to my work).

As soon as I stood up, it became apparent that there WERE actually effects taking place.  My coordination was a little less than accurate, I felt a little off center and wobbly.  As I walked I became aware that I was actually fairly high from the 8-10 hits I had taken.  It felt fairly similar to a marijuana high, but pretty much a body buzz.  Not a kind bud sort of buzz but much more like I had smoked some brown-bud an hour or so before that.

It was mellow and totally manageable.  No marijuana like paranoia or unsociability like I sometimes get. The total experience peaked in about 15-20 minutes and tappered off over the next two-three hours returning me to absolute baseline after that.  I had experienced something similar with 'Sopium' a few years earlier after a Rat Dog show.

I am glad that I found this cheap and interesting extract.  I am not usually one who bothers with stuff like this but, all in the name of science!  I will repeat this experience again...</bodytext></report>
