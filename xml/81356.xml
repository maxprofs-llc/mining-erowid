A 200mg dose of Modafinil produces the following effects in me:
/n
/n
- A non-euphoric rush of mental energy that lasts 20-30 minutes
/n
- Muscular tension: jaw clenching, tightening of the chest
/n
- Mental silence
/n
- Anxiety (I an anxious person by nature)
/n
- Mild anhedonia that lasts up to a day 
/n
/n
Modafinil begins to kick-in within 30 minutes and peaks at 80 minutes. 
/n
/n
The effects are like Adderall, except without the euphoria.
