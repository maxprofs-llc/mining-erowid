I had the fortune of attaining amitriptyline from a friend of mine. I was eager to try it.

At first I started with 25 mg crushed up and drunken with water (I hate snorting).  I felt nothing the first 30 minutes, which was to be expected.  But, like many people, I felt impatient and decided to crush up another green 25mg pill and swallow this.

An hour passed since taking the first one, and I still felt nothing but pretty groggy, so I took about 50 mg of a NODoz (Caffeine pill).  15 minutes later, I was still feeling nothing so I decided to crush up half of a 25 mg pill.  After this, even with the caffeine in me, I felt amazingly sleepy.

After near 2 hours of waiting for an effect, I decided I wanted to go to sleep as the pills made me so drowsy that not even caffeine boosted me up.</bodytext></report>
