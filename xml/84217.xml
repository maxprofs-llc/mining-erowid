I am 20 years old and I have been taking Valium (Diazapam) for 10 years. My friend is 19 and has been taking them since he was 13 and we among other friends all unanimously agree that Valium is great for anxiety but its affects are weakened by the consumption of THC. Consumption of THC before taking Valium will not decrease the affect of the Valium, However consumption of THC after taking Valium will decrease the effects of the Diazapam.</bodytext></report>
