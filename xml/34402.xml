My experience with Tramadol was basically an accident.  My friend Kelly and I were at my apartment when he told me he had found something interesting in my medicine cabinet.  We looked it up on the internet, and, after but a few moments of consideration, we both took a few of the pills.  It was about 5 o'clock, and onset was slow and steady from about 45 minutes in.

After an hour and a half, everything was wonderful.  Music was more enjoyable, conversation with my friend was a lot more interesting, and just kicking back in general felt really good.  I had no trouble driving home, and once there, I went right to bed.  The Tramadol didn't help put me to sleep like I thought it would, but instead made lying awake and simply pondering things almost euphoric.  I was also pleased that when I woke up, I was still slightly affected.  This lingering high lasted well into the school day, and I had some trouble concentrating on my work.

The only other negative notes I have about Tramadol are that I had slight trouble urinating on some occasions, and, after I used it frequently for about a month, I found I was slightly addicted and went through mild withdrawals. I should also add that Tramadol was my first foray into the world of pain killers.   After I tried several other drugs, including Oxycodone and Hydrocodone, I found that I enjoy Tramadol more.</bodytext></report>
