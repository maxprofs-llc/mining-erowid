Something entirely unusual just happened to me that I thought was worth sharing. I don't know what provoked it, but it may have had to do with a number of factors. For some quick background, I'm a somewhat experienced tripper (I stress this point, only because this is the type of report where people often assume the author is somewhat new to psychadelics) - I've taken plenty of all of the following things, in no particular order: ecstasy, shrooms, LSA, DXM, various pharmaceuticals, nitrous, cocaine, crystal, and of course, my favorite, cannabis.  Which is what this odd little report is about.

Some factors that may have influenced it is that I was just diagnosed with being bi-polar and was a little shaken by the news - not upset, just not sure how to take it. I took my first 25mg tablet of Lamictal (lamotrigine, a mood stablilizer for bi-polar disorder) earlier today, and don't know if that has any bearing on this at all. I also took 1mg of xanax last night right before going to bed and woke up feeling much better than normal.

Anyway, I had just gotten home from running some errands a few minutes ago, and stepped out to the back yard to take a hit or two of my brother's joint that I knew he had left there the day before. I didn't want to get high, just get that slight mood lift and relaxation one gets from a couple hits. I lit the joint up and took two giant hits and held them in for as long as I could each time, trying to get the most out of them. I went back in and got sent some distressing news by a friend on my phone, and laid down on my bed. It gets a little shaky here, but I suddenly remember looking straight ahead and not being able to move my body, feeling completely sucked to the bed, and I got extremely paranoid suddenly, my mind screaming suddenly that I was about to die. Ridiculous thoughts about my medicine perhaps clashing with the weed, the weed being laced, etc, began to run through my head. I tried to move and found it impossible, my eyelids were half-open and I couldn't open them any more. I was seeing a blurry view of everything and tried to sit up but was still immobile.

Suddenly, something snapped, and I jerked my whole body around. After that, it was like nothing had ever happened, and I actually got a big grin on my face and thought, 'Holy shit. That's what all those people who thought they smoked PCP were talking about'. Now, about ten minutes later, I feel great yet vividly remember the temporary terror I was in. I'm by no means an inexperienced smoker, I've been doing it for many years, but nothing like this has ever happened before. Frankly, if I knew how, though, I'd do it again. Albeit terrifying, it was certainly unusual and fun. Just thought I'd share.</bodytext></report>
