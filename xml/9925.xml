It was New Years eve, and I wanted to start out the new year with a crazy exsperience. I decided to buy a half quatre of shrooms from a dealer I know. My friend ( all names have been changed ) Justin was having people over that night so we'd have somewhere to party, so I went there.  When I showed up, Justin's dad gave me a glass of coke mixed with some 40% alcohol ( I think whiskey ). So I drank most of it but didn't finish because more people showed up and I wanted to get high. We went into his basement and got out the big purple bong that we bought on our grade 8 trip to Quebec. While my friend Jim was packing a bowl, Justin pulled out the shrooms that he grabbed for me ( I had to go home and eat and couldn't get them myself ). Inside the zipzock bag were stems and a bit of cap dust. One stem was so big the dealer had to break it in half to fit it in the bag ( and on each end of the stem were huge balls.....hard to describe, but they were fun to chew on ).

After smoking some bong hits I ate the shrooms around 8:30 p.m. It seemed like it took only 5 minutes to kick in, cause I was feeling pretty high after eating the stalks. Well about half an hour later I was so high I couldn't move or think. It was really wierd, like I was being hipnotysed or something. Justin's dad came down stairs and looked at me and said something, but his words didn't make any sense so I turned away. I then grabbed my sleeping bag and put over me, I think I was becoming clostrofobic. I felt so disconnected from the world and very confused. I don't remember much of the basement part of that night, but I remember seeing stairs that lead down to Justin's t.v, which really confused me.

My friends decided to roll a blunt ( this was about 11:50 p.m ). When the countdown was on , my friend told me to get in the circle ( rotation ) as the countdown was on. So here I am, fucked out of my mind and standing in a circle with a blunt being passed around. I remember that everytime it was my turn to take hauls, I'd say ' no thanks ' but as quick as I said that my hand reached over, grabbed the blunt, and I started toking. That happened three times, everytime it was my turn I'd say ' no thanks ' and smoke it anyway. I bet my friends had a good laugh about that. Well after the blunt was finished I sat on the couch again. At about 12:46 ( Justin told me this, I don't rememeber ) I shouted out ' HAPPY NEW YEARS! ' with a big smile on my face.

At around 1 a.m I started getting really confused. I thought everyone was on shrooms and was as fucked as I was ( I was the only one there on the mystical mush ) and ( to me ) everyone kept repeating ' how'd we do that? ' . I thought that me and my friends were so high that we somehow stopped time and made time go backwords. This freaked me out so I got off of the couch and started walking upstairs. Justin asked ' where are you going? ' and I replied ' to bed '. He then told me my bed was in the computer room. When I got up there, I didn't know where the computer room was ( even though I know Justin's house like the back of my hand ) so I collapsed on the floor and thought it was a good enough bed.

My friends heard the thump and rushed upstairs. When my friend Ryan tried helping me up, I was limp...then all of a sudden I stood up really quick and yelled ' cousins! ' ( don't remember saying that ) They then showed me where the room was, and I laided on the bed for hours and hours . I just stared at the wall ( I wasn't really tripping, I was just ' gone ' ) I kept hearing cupboards opening and slamming ( which only I was hearing ). I then started screaming to make sure I was alive, Justin came up, told me to shut up, so I did. Again, I thought I was stuck in time or in my own little personal after death.

My friends decided to go to bed. I got off the bed ( this was around 4 in the morning ) and I went to Justin's room where he was trying to sleep. I just walked in, and sat on the floor. He helped me get up, and then I wondered into the dining room ( he knew I was just fucked and decided to play along ). I sat at the table and started drinking the mix his dad made for me earlier, Justin stopped me instantly, telling me I'll just get worse. I then walked towards the phone and started calling my house. Justin hung it up saying  what the fuck are you going to tell your parents? That ' I'm fucked up and don't know what I'm doing ' ? I then walked around my after life some more. I opened his back door and looked outside, the snow looked so shiney and nice looking. I then went into the basement where the rest of the crew where sleeping. I asked them all if they had a clock, no one knew what I was talking about. Justin told them I couldn't sleep, then told me to go to bed. I kept asking ' but where? ' .

At around 5 a.m I calmed down and slept in his dads bed ( the computer rooms bed had my piss all over it, don't remember peeing my pants but I did ) . I then fell asleep....not quite normal, but coming down.

I think what happened was I was punished by the shrooms. I wasn't ready for a half quatre, and I was abusing the shrooms powers. I think I actually became a mushroom for awhile ( which could explained why I couldn't move ). I now know there are different worlds out there, and some aren't meant to be viewed. Next time I try 5 grams ( I know half quatres are only 3.5 grams, but you should of seen the count this dealer gave me! ) I'm going to do them more prepared. Thanks for taking the time to read my experiece. PeAcE
