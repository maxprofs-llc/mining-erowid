had a hell of a trip last night, was staying over at a friend (Huxley) place for the evening and we planned a mostly quasi-legal drug night. We had a box of whip-its, 20+ grams of salvia, a half a gram of hash, 1 and 1 1/2 bottles of Robotussin Maximum  Strength Cough syrup and a box of Coricidin (I know - bad idea, but I've done them plenty of times and wasn't worried about a single box) and were armed with my favorite smoking device, Bucks Bongy.

We left the local supermarket and I dosed 12 of the Coricidin (360 mgs of DXM and 52 mgs CPM) we arrived at his place some time later, I ate a small amount of chinese food and we smoked a bit of hash, did a few whippits and each had a salvia experience. Mine could be summed up as meeting his neighborhood of animals and whatnot and the crickets eventually saying all the noise animals made was more with telling us not to do away with them than interspecies communication.

Not long afterwards we decided to head into his pool and so we suited up and headed over with a small amount of whippits and balloons and the dispenser. Had a couple of  interesting experiences; listening to noises under the water and a near birth experience that I aborted (no pun intended) by coming up for air a bit early - also one experiece of swimming through infinity and understanding the concept of such.

I then decided I wanted to put multiple nitrous containers into a single balloon - the nitrous tried to discourage this venture by the balloon coming off and my only being able to catch a third or so of the second cartrige in the balloon. I then proceeded to put three catriges in the balloon atop the third and ducked underwater with dispenser to my lips. I inhaled deeply held it for a moment and then released through my nose and took another inhalation off the balloon - with every passing second I moved the world I could feel farther away from me with my mind and at some point had the experience of standing up and moving around in someplace other dark - if there were other entities there maybe I could feel them but they made no attempts at contacting me. I stayed in this very dark place for some time and have difficulty remembering other details. I will now insert my friends accounting.

He put 3 cartregis in a balloon and went floating off to the dark side of the pool.  I was just floatin around chillin when I thought 'Eh, it is possable that somethin bad could happen, so I better keep an eye on him'. I really did not think anythin was goin to happen, but I desided that I would count to 30 before checking on him.  So I counted to thirty and he had still not come up from the water.  I swam over and looked at him and he was litteraly layin on the bottom of the pool floor.  I kept counting and nugged and kicked him with my foot too see if I could rouse him, but he did not rise.

At this I got conserned and lifted him out of the water so he could breath.  I probebly counted to 40 or 50 before I got him out.  I did not imeditly pull him to the edge, I just tryed to keep him floating so I could see if he was breathing.  He was not (surprise surprise), so I started to pull him to the edge of the pool.  I was pretty sure he was not totally dead yet cause his body was still light and did not feel like dead weight.  I layed him on the concrete on the side of the pool, but had difficultly keeping him from falling back in.  I checked his heart and it was still beating, that was a good thing, but I honestly belived his breathing was not there.  I got all the water out of his mouth then performed mouth to mouth resesitation.

I only did it two or three times and then he started sputtering and, it seemed, minimel breathing.  Then he started grunting and making the sounds of life.  I was pretty happy at that.  He layed there motionless for another couple of minutes, just breathing and making grunting sounds.  Then after he layed down for a few, he got up and went inside with out a word.  I was just glad with the way things turned out, as opossed to how they could have turned out.

I remember vaguely coming to at the side of the pool and the shorts I was wearing felt foreign and wrong. I got up and walked (half stumbled) over to what looked like a towel (I later saw it was quite dirty) dropped my shorts wrapped up and went inside to put my own clothing back on. Layed down for a bit, dropped another half bottle and ate some food - proceeded through the rest of the night relatively without incident.

I can say that this experience rattled my cage, though it probably didn't scare me as much as it could have/ should have. Today, the day after, I feel a bit weak (moreso than normal hangover from such drug experiences) and my chest hurts deep in my lungs. I wouldn't say I was putting this out as a deterent, merely to bring to people's attention that such things do happen and its always best to have a friend around for questionably dangerous journeys.</bodytext></report>
