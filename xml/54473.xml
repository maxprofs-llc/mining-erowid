T+0:01  My teeth, throat, mouth, all go numb, I am noticing feelings of euphoria, an increase in heart rate, and shaky hands. Continue to smoke while talking with my girlfriend.

T+0:02  The effects are much stronger now, there is almost a tunnel vision where everything focuses in around the pipe, or whatever I am looking at, heart rate is really fast now and blood pressure is defiantly up, feelings of extreme euphoria and sexuality.

T+0:05  The drug is gone now and I put the glass tube away, this is the peak of the effects, everything feels perfect, extreme euphoria, numbness, definite increase in sex drive and socialization I am happy just talking to my girlfriend about whatever comes into my mind, I find my thoughts drifting towards sex.

T+0:10  The effects are coming down, there is an powerful desire to do more and I go back to the glass tube a few times with the idea that maybe I missed some I was surprised at how immediately addictive this was. I am still physically stimulated and shaky but there is no longer any euphoria.

/n
T+0:30  Still stimulated, the desire to do more is subsiding, I feel worse than baseline but it is by no means unbearable.

T+1:00  Baseline.

Aftereffects  I feel fine today, I think the best way to describe my experience was pure euphoria, thats all it was, just concentrated reward, there was really nothing profound to take away from this experience but it was enjoyable, although I am not sure if I will ever do it again because its potential for addiction scares me.</bodytext></report>
