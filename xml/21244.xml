I am writing this as a precautionary word of advice for those who never have tried this drug.

People around my part use meth recreationally, it's pretty common among a certain, pretty large group of people, and shunned (or kept secret) by those more 'astute' drug users.

It's use recreationally however, is often in excess, and thanks to harm reduction efforts, this kind of use can be deterred.

Well anyway, I had done meth a few times prior to this experience, introduced to the drug by a friend. I had always used it in appropriate doses and had not had a problem with it. However, one day, I obtained an HG of what they call around here 'fire' or very pure dope in powdered form. I put it in a 'snuff bullet' and a started ripping, hanging out a friends house at first for several hours and became really disinterested in this, and moved on to go out to visit another friend. All of this was over a period of say 6 hours, and the whole time I just kept getting speedier and speedier doing more and more shots from the bullet. Now to anyone who's ever done coke before, they are used to the high lasting for a bout an hour usually, so they do several lines and it's not a big deal. But with meth, pure meth, that is, I do several lines and I'm jacked for at least 12 hrs. Well, before I knew it I had done close to a half-gram within 10 hrs. This might not sound like a ton, but it was really kicking my ass. I was flying and felt really good, super-human at first, as could be expected, but soon realized that I had overdone it. I stayed up for 3 days and wanted to eat very badly, just praying for this dope to wear off, finally when it did, I felt absolutely shitty.

I felt very weak and anemic and could barely eat because of lack of energy. This is when I realized how shitty powders, especially meth really can be.

From then on I don't need to fuck with this stuff. It can be tempting if I feel a little slothy, but Wheaties, and some multi-vitamins, work better for energy without the side effects.

Anyone considering trying this, nah, don't. Herbs and hallucinogens are so much more enjoyable and beneficial, that it seems nearly a sacrilege to compare marijuana and shrooms to meth.  Whereas, meth and coke make people have a sense of artificial super-humaness, and make already selfish people more selfish and anal, entheogens if used by the right people in the right context, can bring a beautiful realization and apprection of the more lovely things in the world. Meth is for people who have to stay up for weeks on end, not recreation.</bodytext></report>
