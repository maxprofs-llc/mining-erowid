Picture this.....I'm sitting in front of my computer smoking a cigarette and coming down from a night of doing blow.  It's 7:30 am now.  I started at 10:00 pm the night before. I've been sitting in front of my computer for about 8 hours now.  In and out of chat rooms because I wanted to chat with people who had no clue who I am.  My shoulders are tense and my nose is runny.

I've been doing blow on and off for about a year now.  More often in the last couple of months.  The feeling I used to get from it isn't there any more.  I've read all the stories on this site.  Some of them I can relate to and some of them I can't believe.  Everyone has a different experience from it.  I'm here to share mine because of the ones I can relate to have opened my eyes.

I've noticed a few changes in myself physically and pyschologically in the past few months.  Physically I am tired all the time.  My nose is congested or runny which is a pain....I always blame it on alergies when people ask me.  Strength wise I am weaker.  Pyschologically I am irratable, more alert, less caring, driven and I have little or no patience.

Once I do a few bumps I'm back to normal.  I am my old self again.  That is the scary part.  I don't rely on it but it brings me back.  I say I'm not addicted to it but for some reason my mind craves it.  I can't wait for the next line.  The problem I have now is that the next line doesn't do anything for me.  1 leads to 2 to 3 and so on.....

So for all you people who are in the same boat.  Let me say this.  This is the beginning of an addiction.  You are at a fork in the road.  You can choose to continue on the same path or move onto a cleaner path.   I'm here now.....I don't know what to do!
