Back in May of 01, some buddies and I got tickets to go to the Tom Petty concert. Being teenagers, we decide that no concert is complete without a fat sack of weed. Later on that day (the day before the concert) we get an ounce and a half, and go over to someone's apartment. Through the night, things got progressively stranger and stranger. After about six or eight bowls, I was feeling extremely disoriented and it just wasn't the usual high. Something was different about how I moved, how things sounded, how things looked. I came to the conclusion that I was just experiencing some hallucinations. 'Maybe it's just trippy weed' I thought. The night progressed, and we proceeded to smoke every way you can think of, and by about one am, I was sitting on the floor indian style, unable to move my arms, legs or head. I then realized that I was watching all this from the corner.

While I'm watching myself sit helpless, I look towards a wall at this blacklight poster that has stopped glowing. Two human-like figures that were entirely grey (think person made out of paint) came out of the wall and walked over to where I was sitting, one of them grabbed my skull while the other one proceeded to cut it open. Once they opened my skull I watched them take out my brain and insert wires into the base of my skull and move me around on the floor like a snake. After several seconds of this, I woke up, lying on the floor, twitching. I don't really know what happened, but my friends say I was having a seizure. Thing is, I'm not epileptic. I was, however, taking a medication that is used in the treatment of various things, including epilepsy. I have since then stopped taking that med, and it has never happened again.</bodytext></report>
