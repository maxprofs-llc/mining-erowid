I noticed a request for information reguarding ssri's and mushrooms.  I've been taking lexapro (SSRI)10 mgs and wellbutrin (dopamine / norepenephrine reuptake inhibitors) 150 mgs for about 2 months now, and I took shrooms 2 nights ago.  I was very pleased with my effects, the last time I took shrooms was about a year ago, so I feel that I didn't have any tolerance to them the night I took them.  The effects were alittle diminished, no visuals, aside from walking and seeing the ground sway up and down.  Very relaxed happy feeling though, I have social anxiety disorder, and while on shrooms I went to a party and I was relaxed, had deep conversations with complete strangers, somthing I know I wouldnt be able to do had it not been for the shrooms.  Had a great time, the next day I didn't feel any hang over effects, still felt the happy feeling and I was still able to meet new people very easily.  my friend also took the same dose as I did and he was tripping balls, saw many images and was laughing hysterically for 4 hours straight so I know the shrooms were potent.  Though I didn't trip as hard as he did I'm very glad I did them, SSRI's and Shrooms +++++</bodytext></report>
