I am an 18 year old male and have had a long journey in the past couple of years with many different mind altering substances. Starting with marijuana in the beginning of my junior year of high school, I have since tried Cocaine, Ecstasy, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, DXM, Nitrous Oxide, LSD, Shrooms, Salvia, Alprazolam, Diazepam, Phenezepam, Adderal, Ritalin, and upon running out of most of the well known drugs I began looking towards research drugs and since then have tried 2c-I, 2c-e, JWH-018, MDPV, Methylone and my favorite of the research drugs: Mephedrone.

I have tried a lot of drugs and have learned that I love stimulants, I dont have a lot of self confidence so when I take any one of my top favorite stims (X, Drone, Coke) I love the way it makes me feel while I still am in control. I hate the feeling of losing control like with hallucinogens, though I didnt mind LSD. Unforntunately these are some of the costliest drugs especially because the quality of the rolls in my area are sow low I have to take around 4 to get a good effect. So naturally when I discovered Mephedrone back in the fall of 2009 I was thrilled because price was low and quality was high, and thus begins my experience.

I love drugs, perhaps a little too much, and I love researching them just as much, understanding them and their effects they grant their users, I have read so many experience reports I figured the least I can do is give back. Doing all this research yielded a lot of drugs that I wanted to try and due to a lack of connections and living at home I was constricted in the amount I could actually do. That all changed when I went to college, not only did I now have my own mailbox but due to meeting a lot of new people the availability of the drugs skyrocketed.

I stuck mainly with coke, x and oxy but me getting high on all of this was starting to cause my bank account to get low so I resorted to research chemicals and began ordering all the drugs that I had been reading about. I started with 2c-I and 2c-e and after a not so great experience with both I was a little disappointed with the research drug market. However, I continued to experiment ordering JWH-018 and phenezepam next.

The JWH was great vaporizing only a few milligrams and getting extremely high with a feeling that felt exactly like weed. I quit that though due to the health factor and an uneasiness with chemicals being in my lungs. Phenezepam was a horrible idea, I was expecting something similar to xanax, so after feeling nothing after dropping what I thought was around 10 mg I decided I might feel something if I snorted the remaining 40 and blacked out for the next three days.

Having only three research chemicals left that I wanted to try, I tried to hold some optimism with methylone and mephedrone. I was saving these for last because the effects were supposed to be like two of my favorites, coke and x. I got the methylone first and swallowed 300 mg and got a nice buzz that coincided with the reports that I read where the effects were felt most when conversing with other people that are close to you.

And then I tried mephedrone. As soon as it came in the mail I ripped open the package inside was 2 grams of a fluffy white powder, which most closely resembled powdered snow or powdered sugar. The smell was not as bad as I thought it would be (from reading reports) and now I actually like it. Then I did what any drug enthusiast would: I lined some up. I measured out a low dose of 50 mg and lined it up. I found it very hard to make lines with as the substance tends to stick together, but eventually I got a decent line and after rolling up a 20, up the nose it went. It burns a lot.

Especially that first time, it felt like it went right under my eye and immediately caused tears to stream out.

Within minutes I was feeling better, light seemed brighter, energy levels doubled and the urge to move around and talk was present. Satisfied with the feeling and having the peak effects wear down a little after about 20 minutes I weighed out 150 mg and separated it into two 75 mg lines and snorted each up the left and right nostril. This shit hits hard. I was flying high feeling better then a large line of good coke or 3 or 4 pills of x, I was moving around the room blasting electronic music and talking a mile a minute. The feeling is similar to that of mdma where your body feels fluid and you feel like you are floating when walking, I was feeling great and I was in love.

After that experience I have done a lot of drone since and have a vast understanding of the drug. Before I get into that I must address my least favorite part about it, which is the comedown. The initial effects hit you the hardest but with that rush is a retraction of the peak effect at a fairly quick rate as well. The best feelings leave so quickly that, even though I still have the residual stimulation, I get a sense of emptiness and am not content with doing pretty much anything, depressing thoughts also normally accompany the comedown and I pretty much convince myself that I will never do any drug again nearly every singe time. Loving the high so much but hating the comedown I began to think about ways to combat it.

First I tried xanax and found a line of 1 mg of xanax to do the trick but that normally makes me just sit there having a numb brain. This is not good because the majority of the time I want to use it at parties. So it was really only a matter of time until I combined it with alcohol, and when that finally did happen I pretty much did not do it without. Heavy drinking and a line of drone is not the way to go as it will almost always lead to a short-term blackout where I act like I just dropped 6 rolls, and that is not the best situation when I dont want to earn a reputation as a complete jackass.

What I found works best is drinking until I have a small buzz (for me like 4 quick shots or 6 beers, I have a high tolerance), and then doing a nice sized line like 125-150mg, this yields me one of the best highs I can get from mephedrone with no comedown at all. I float around parties talking to anyone about anything, that is one of my favorite effects of this drug, I have an urge to talk and the conversation flows so easy allowing me to talk effortlessly to anyone, although I have said some dumb things on high doses, most of the time it works beautifully. The best thing about combining it with alcohol is that even when the peak effects of mephedrone fade away, that urge to talk and keep conversation seems to stick around for hours, so a line right in the beginning of the night is perfect for any party.

By far my favorite combination with mephedrone, is one that I have only done once which is mephedrone, alcohol, methylone and weed. I did this once at a party and was on cloud nine for hours, it is by far the best chemical high that I have ever gotten. The methylone mixes so well and creates something that is identical to x but better. That night I also did some nitrous oxide when I was coming down and that was one of my best nitrous oxide highs I have ever had besides acid and nitrous oxide. I have also done just mephedrone and nitrous oxide and found that enjoyable but I dont like it because I feel like the vasoconstriction and the lack of oxygen is a bad combination for the brain.

Besides doing it at parties my other favorite place is to do it at clubs or concerts. Dancing is amazing on this drug and combined with the enhanced sound perception and the intense visual effects due to the eye wiggles I get from the mephedrone (eye wiggles normally start appearing at 125mg and are amazing when I approach 175mg) being in a dark environment with pounding music and flashing lights is one of the best times I will have on any drug and at times it exceeds x. When I am at clubs I will normally bring like 500 mg and visit the bathroom once every hour doing about 125 mg each time. However, when I am at a show, I often can not go to the bathroom because I might lose my spot or it is in the middle of a set, so I have to resort to swallowing the drug. When I do this I normally dont eat for three hours before I plan on swallowing it and normally wrap up 400 mg in a paper towel and swallow that around 20 minutes before I want the effects to kick in. This creates a great gentle high that lacks the rush but lengthens the effects and mellows them out a little. When doing this I also like to keep 100-125mg in a dime bag and snort in right out of the bag about an hour after I parachute the initial dose. This throws me into one of the best highs I can get from mephedrone alone and is perfect if I can time it up so it hits right when a favorite song is going to come on, and eye wiggles are insane at this point.

So after 6 months of heavy mephedrone use, I am done. Although I love it more then any other drug, it is too good and I am worried about the negative effects that it could have in the future, as I already noticed some negative effects in the peak of my use relating mostly to short term memory loss at a noticeable level, and scrambling of words when speaking and word recall seems to be hit especially. After one month of no use though, I am already starting notice an increase (or recovery rather) in my short-term memory and I dont scramble my words as much, and word recall is slightly increasing though not that much. I am glad I am done but will miss it, I have had some of the greatest times on this drug and for the price and quality (as long as its legal, it has just been banned in the uk) it really cannot be beat.</bodytext></report>
