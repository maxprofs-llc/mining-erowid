Me and my friends have done many psychadelics. In the years I've gone way beyond what I thought tripping was. I first thought tripping was all about colors and trails. Then it became about passing this one point, where all of reality goes out the fucking window and anything is possible to see or do. But now it's all about the spirituality in nature. I hadn't really started doing the wild strong doses until after the near death experience. After the near death experience we started calling ourselves fearless psychonauts. Fuck the milligram scale cause its more fun to be in the dark about it.

It was just like any other day. Me and my friends were smoking pot just like usual. My friend Ken had purchased a gram of 5-MeO-DMT. We had been experimenting with it for about 3 days. We would sprinkle just a smidge on a bowl of pot. It felt like eating a couple hits of decent acid. The trails were massive the colors were prevelant and even though there was an uncomfortable body rush at first it was the bomb.

So me and Ken were sitting in his room he had already come down from the smoking some 5-MeO. He smoked it about 20 minutes before I took the hit. Ken is my most experienced friend with tripping. He has eatin 12 hits of acid all at once with no tolerance. He was the one that showed me colors and trails are only the first step into a completely different universe. Ken covered the entire bowl of pot with 5-Meo. He said, 'I dare you to take the biggest hit yet.' I obviously trying to look like a badass in front of my friend was like your damn right I will. So I did...

I put the lighter to it and took the hit. It tasted just like any other hit of 5-Meo, burning plastic. (Mmm mmm bitch!) This hit was different though. I exhaled it. Ken looked at me and asked me if I felt anything. I looked at him and said no. Because I honestly didn't. Oh shit was I wrong.

I slowly started feeling my breath weakening. I was breathing less and less with every breath. I was trying to breathe harder and harder but it was just making it worse. I leaned back on the bed because I had no physical energy left from the lack of air. Then as I felt the lost of my breath leave my lungs I closed my eyes.

As my eyes closed I saw no colors. My soul rose above my body. I looked back and saw my body laying lifeless on my friends bed. Then I looked forward towards the dark tunnel. My body starting moving toward the the tunnel started moving towards meet. It was as if we trying to meet one another. Once we started moving towards one another a white light appeared at the end of the tunnel. When I was about 6 feet away from the white light someone started to come out of the light. The light was pure and blinding. I looked around because it was so bright. The tunnel was now completely infinite. Surrounding me were thousands of orbs that appeared like eyes. For a visual hint look at Alex Grey's-Dying. The orbs appeared to be like eyes because they were shaped just like an eye, and I could see through them. The eyes were looking at different places in the universe at all the points in time. I could see all and everything that has and will ever happen.

I then looked forward and the most beautiful, most peaceful and most gentle woman walked out of the light. Her hair was brown, her cheeks were rose colored and her skin looked softer than the petal of a rose. She was wearing a white robe that had a hood that was up and the robe covered her whole body. And then with the softest most serene voice she spoke...
/n

The first thing she said was, 'Don't be scared my child for it is not your time to go.' Then all the fear that I had instilled my body went away. I didn't know why, but I knew I could trust her. Then every question I ever had about life, religion, or God was answered. It's hard to say everything that was told me because it's difficult and it chokes me up every time I think about it but I'll try to state everything the woman had said to me.
/n

The woman told me that no religion is wrong because it is just the word of God being seen and spoken through another persons eyes. You can only sway a persons thoughts because a person will always think what they want because they think its there life and there rules. The woman said we are born. Then we are meant to enjoy all of life. The good, the bad, and everything inbetween because that is the meaning of life, to simply enjoy it. Because that was God's gift to us as her children, the most precious thing God could provide us with, life. She said when we die our soul returns back with God, and our body is meant to stay in the earth to fertilize other life such as plants. Everything happens in cycles. Just like our lives it is the same with all everyday occurences. Then after we return with God in heaven we get to receive all the riches of the afterlife.

Then as quickly I got there and received the knowledge people search there whole lives for, my eyes were opening and I was sitting up. Then a physical wind started moving out of my chest. It was the greatest feeling of ecstacy one can ever feel. I looked at ken and both of our eyes were filled with tears. Then right as about we were about to cry about or friend who had left the room to use the bathroom had entered. And we acted as if nothing had happened. Our friend could tell something happened but had no clue what.

We spoke about it the next day. Apparently when I sat back and stopped breathing Ken said a woman's voice that he had never heard came out of me, speaking through me words of great wisdom. I couldn't believe the woman spoke through me, and asked him what she said and he said everything word for word what happened. It changed me and him forever. Not only did I become religious but ken did too. And that is a change for him because he was one of the people that I knew that was extremely evil. He's done some wild unmentionable shit. And by unmentionable I mean unimaginable.

All I can say is the God is real. I spoke to the Mother Mary and it doesn't matter if you can believe me or not because God and I know the truth. I am an agnostic turned completely around into a religious person.</bodytext></report>
