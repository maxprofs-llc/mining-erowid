as i write this i am just thinking that maybe i should't share this much emotion with everyone but here it is:
/n
everything is so stimulating
/n
breathtaking and intresting
/n
this must be the feeling of birth
/n
take me
/n
amazingly colourful
/n
take me
/n
i'm nothing but myself
/n
or are these thoughts just thoughts of an acid trip
/n
is this really happening
/n
or am i going to end
/n
to end
/n
end
/n
everything's dancing
/n
lust is something i dont and havent experienced in 100%
/n
take me
/n
im'myself 
/n
why am i writing this
/n
what is the meaning
/n
its just because its fucking niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
/n
colours are just an imagination
/n
everything is just in the mind
/n
amazing
/n
just amazing
/n
is what i set my eyes upon 
/n
so whideopening
/n
and liberating
/n
can it really exist?
/n
or is this just a hallusination?
/n
the feeling of becoming one with myself
/n
if that can even be described
/n
is what i am experiensing
/n
complete awereness
/n
im in me
/n
in my mind
/n
this makes sence now
/n
i can even touch the fucking question of existanse
/n
who am i do i exist
/n
does this reality i am tough to live with really exist?
/n
or is it all in the mind?
/n
what you believe in
/n
not what you are tought to but REALLY believe
/n
let it go free
/n
does this make sence to an already tought mind
/n
?
/n
possibly not
/n
i have lost self awereness
/n
everything is new
/n
the touch 
/n
everything just comes
/n
everything is like i am doing it for the first time
/n
its raw material to my touch</bodytext></report>
