Went to sleep quicker than usual, had a Lucid Dream and awoke feeling extremely relaxed to the point I could not be bothered getting out of bed.

Felt melancholic, reflecting on my life, had feeling I did not belong in my own house; a state of dissociation.  This lifted after approx 3 hours.  Drug had been in my system for about 14 hours before symptoms lifted.</bodytext></report>
