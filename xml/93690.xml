Dosed sublingually, 2x 350 microgram tabs each, myself and two friends. Cozy, familiar environment, a place of many former explorations. Held in lip for 20 minutes.

Felt very benign and smooth, very relaxed and peaceful. Little desire or need for conversation as felt so content. State of mind was dreamy, drifting with a distinct phenethylamine signature.

No stimulation, rather great to relax with good friends, good music and good spliffs. Glittering closed eye visuals, entrancing but not overwhelming at this level.

Would like to see what this molecule would be capable of at higher doses. Entirely pleasant and very easy going, no trace of anxiety although set and setting were optimal. Very clean feeling on the body and mind, no hangover. So entirely enjoyable for my friends and I, but in my personal opinion no replacement for LSD for example. Worth a try though, very agreeable. Good stuff!</bodytext></report>
