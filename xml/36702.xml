This is a report not about my own experiences, but rather the story of a friend of a friend, who recently had a frightening ordeal with the seed pods of a datura plant.

Early this summer, this friend who we'll call 'Pat' went on an extended, multiple-week vacation with his family to Florida. Pat is an upper-classman in high school, and has a reputation of doing very stupid things with hallucinogens. Knowing he would be unable to drink or smoke pot during his vacation, Pat brought with him a bag full of datura pods. One night, despite warnings his friends and even I had given him, he ate all the seeds from three seed pods. An hour went by and Pat didn't feel anything, so he ate another pod. From what Pat told me, the first hour or so of actual tripping was enjoyable and controllable. He spoke to friends who were actually still back in his home town, and then they would leave the room and never come back. It's amazing how similar all the accounts of datura trips are in this respect...

By this time, it was fairly late at night and Pat's entire family was asleep. They were soon awakened, however, as Pat began screaming at the top of his lungs for his two younger brothers to shut up. Both of them were asleep in their beds, and there stood Pat, screaming at them to 'JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP AND BE QUIET.' When his dad walked in, Pat freaked and darted into the bathroom. He began scrubbing the bathtub furiously, apparently trying to look sober. Pat's dad, aware that his son was obviously hallucinating but unable to get him to admit what he took, drove Pat to the hospital.

The doctors at the hospital didn't know what was up, and drug tests were all negative. One of them came to the conclusion that a perscription medication Pat was taking had triggered the early onset of schizophrenia. The entire time Pat was examined, he was speaking to people who weren't there, and sometimes to himself out loud. Apparently this medication had been known to do that in patients with the right conditions for future mental illness. Pat spent the next three days in a psychiatric unit, although from his account he only realized where he was on the third day. For the duration of his time there, Pat had to be accompanied by a suicide guard as a precaution. On the third day, as he was coming down, he got pissed off at another patient who was talking in ebonics, so he screamed at him 'YOU ARENT BLACK!' As a result, Pat had to sit in the timeout room (a tiny room with padded walls, floors and ceiling) for 20 minutes.

Pat was stupid with the datura that he took, and it ended up ruining his vacation, costing his family thousands in medical bills, and landing him in rehab at the demand of his family. When he regained reality and told doctors the name of the plant that he took, surprise surprise... they had never heard of it before. While it is a funny story in retrospect, I feel indirectly at fault. I was the one who told this kid where he could find the plants and what they did, on the week before his vacation.</bodytext></report>
