I have tried this compound twice, the last time being several months ago, though I took some notes at the time, as I always do.

4-FMP is definitely an amphetamine-like stimulant, though with a mellow, less edgy character. For me, the amphetamine side-effects are moderated and its euphoria is longer lasting. I got no special insights under this compound although it was an excellent social enhancer, like a very mellow methamphetamine. Most importantly for me, the come-down was very moderate; I tend to suffer very badly from the after-effects of dopamine related stimulants. I still got my usual 'sweaty armpits' and 'shrunken organ' side effects though.

Some people speak of a serotonin-like effect of 4-FMP. This may be true, though it is of far less magnitude than MDMA.

Pure 4-FMP has a pleasant, vaguely citrous smell and taste.

There was no chance of sleeping after taking 100 mg at 9:00 PM and I quite happily kept going until the next evening, when I slept soundly and awoke feeling fully refreshed. I never felt over-stimulated during the evening, and the next day, I didn't feel like the tweaker who wants to sleep but cannot.

For me, a far more pleasurable experience than meth and similar. 100mg of 4-FMP, a few glasses of red wine and some excellent company cannot be beaten. Set is everything.
