I had haerd about the pschoactive effects of nutmeg and decided to try it out. I'd previously tried smoking and drinking a tea from it with no effect so decided to try eating it. This is what happened.

/n
7am - 20g of whole nutmeg ground into powder and drunk with OJ
/n
/n
8am - feeling nausious, and decided to go back to sleep.
/n
/n
4pm - woke up feeling sick and a little dizzy
/n
/n
4:30 - a lot more dizzy, alot more sick and threw up
/n
/n
5pm - a little less sick and extremely dizzy, slight visual   distortions, same for next hour
/n
/n
6pm - pass out on bed
/n
/n
11:30 next morning - woke up, still feeling quite dizzy but not sick
/n
/n
1pm - effects wearing off
/n
/n
3pm - back to baseline

Overall I must say I did not enjoy the experience, will not try it again, and do not reccommend any one else trys it.</bodytext></report>
