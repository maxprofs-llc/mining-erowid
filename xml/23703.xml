My Head Shrinker touted this pill as a help for Bi-Polar disorder, to keep me from smoking weed daily to get down from the 'upswings' I have. Hey it helped that (along with Paxil and Seroquel). I must admit 2400mg is a little excessive, but this is something that I CAN grow a tolerance for. With my size 2400mg (or more at times) leaves me with a slightly narcotic tingly feeling with a nice 'head' high.

NOTE: After giving my roomie 3x800mg tabs of Neurontin his normally crabby ass was feeling quite loving and chatted at length about his life and feelings. Hmmm Must REALLY be a mood stabilizer. The only drawback I have found with the medication is the slow reaction time. 2+ hrs for me to kick in UNLESS I drink a soda. Look for an 1hr reaction time when drinking a can of coke. Well, in conclusion, I love the stuff!</bodytext></report>
