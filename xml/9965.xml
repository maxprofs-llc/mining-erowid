The drug test I took was a pre-employment screen.  From what the nurse told me, it was a standard 5 drug screen.

I tried getting as much info from the Human Resources woman at the company about the drug screen without jeopardizing my employment, but she didn't really have any idea about anything.  So, based on that, I passed my drug test.  No failing on a false positive for opium. It just didn't set off any bells or whistles.  Perhaps the drug testing company uses some type of test that differentiates DXM from other drugs, or perhaps DXM just doesn't really cause false positives for opium or PCP.</bodytext></report>
