My experence with mind altering substances is above the average psychonaught having used all the street options(some more than others some waaaay to much) and since I am training to become a Herbalist I have tried many plants and extracts, I have little experence with pharms. Having stopped smoking my favorite green herb for school for about three months now I was feeling the need to experement.  I had purchased an oz of pennyroyal dried herb some time ago and had not needed nor desired to use it.  Most herbal books will tell you that this herb is used as an digestive aid for those who have sluggish digestion. Others will know it from the song Pennyroyal Tea by Nirvana, Kurt Cobain used it for is stomach dissorder.  It also has a few interesting actions such as the abortifacient (to abort pregnancy) minor anti-septic actions and an insect repellant. This plant should only be used in small amounts and if you come by its oil it should not be taken internally.
