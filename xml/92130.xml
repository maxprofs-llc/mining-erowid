I am a 19 years of age living in London at the time of my experience. Mephedrone has jumped up and grabbed my generation with its gurny claws and doesn't seem to be letting go. Having watched too many of my friends completely fuck up over this, lets face it, unknown and dangerously moreish substance, I felt the need to find something new and less addictive for my closer buddys to get into. Sounds dubious I know but it made sense to me.

So after some reasonably extensive research I purchase one gram of this 4-meo pcp off a reliable online vendor,with intent to give it a dummy run the next week. Most certainly would have stuck to this plan if it wasn't for my oldest and most unreliable friend Jack Daniels. Friday comes, I have a barbeque at mine for an old friend. One litre later and I'm upstairs weighing up my dose of the 4-meo. After my research I had decided that 150mg would be perfect for a first try, with an initial tester of 5mg to ensure it doesn't react funny with me in some way. What I was thinking when I dropped two 150mg bomgs I don't know. Fuck it, lets see what this legal shit is made off...

F all! Its fake I've been mugged off. Balls. If anyone is planning on trying this substance please listen to me when I tell you it takes a while to kick in. It took around two hours for me to feel anything. In those two hours I figured I'd purchase a a gram of mephedrone along with a few friends and take the night up a notch. Before I knew it the meo had crept up and took a stop watch to my head. Everything was stopping... I had the urge to do nothing but nothing. Now my eyes are closing.

The next two or three or four or five hours (time was very hard to keep track of) were spent in this comatosed state. I suppose it could be comparable to ketamine, except when on ketamine it'll wear off half an hour later and I can get in bed and get to sleep (or re-dose). This substance had a much more sharper edge to it - THIS is how I felt and was gonna feel like for a LONG time. A minute felt like an hour, hour felt like a day, you get the picture. CEV's were moderate but that could be put down to the mephedrone, to some extent. The feeling just seemed to consume everything... has to be some strong stuff if it overcomes the buzz of mephedrone to such a degree. Once I came off this peak I was left in am almost agitated state where I just wanted to return to normal and get to sleep but it just wasn't happening, even after a few spliffs.

I would not in any way call the primary effects of this substance enjoyable. That being said, I will try this again at some point in the not so near future; sober and at a lower dose. I'm not gonna bore you with all the chemicals I've previously done but its pretty extensive, and I can say with conviction that this chemical is a force not to be reckoned with.</bodytext></report>
