About 3 weeks ago, my friend Josh and I bought some mushrooms. It was supposed to be 1/4 of an ounce, but we only got a little over 1/8 of an ounce. We were angry, because we had wanted to split a quarter and have a very strong trip, but since we didn't fully pay our dealer due to the shortage, it was okay.

It was a school night, and we had a half-day the next day which started at about 11:00 in the morning, so we figured we could trip that night. It was about 8:00, and after some deliberation regarding if Josh's mom would notice the extreme pupil dilation caused by the mushrooms, we decided to eat them. Josh split up the bag as evenly as possible, and we ate them, chewing for about 10 minutes, as that will supposedly make the trip more intense. I enjoyed the taste of dried fungus as I thought of what was to come. I went into Josh's bathroom and smoked a cigarette underneath the vent fan, hoping this would bring on the high a bit faster.

By the time I got back to Josh's room, I could already feel something which wasn't quite right in me. Josh was feeling the same way. He put on headphones and listened to my Nine Inch Nails CD, but he took the headphones off about a minute later, complaining that the music made him feel nauseous. I began to notice the nausea too, but it wasn't very bad, so I just ignored it. As we decided to turn on the TV, the trip began.

As soon as the first glimpses of light flickered from the screen, what I saw was complete and utter chaos. There was people crashing about and breaking things, and the camera would occasionally focus on one man, who held what appeared to be an axe. It was intense, but as I continued to watch, I realized that what I was watching was Chapelle's Show! The 'axe-wielding madman' was John Mayer, playing his guitar, and the people were just dancing to the music. I laughed as I realized this, and Josh, who had perceived something similar to me, did as well. As the show went on, I couldn't stop laughing. Every single joke was a riot, and I couldn't calm down. I turned off the TV when I thought the sketch was over, and put on some video games. It was Super Mario World, for Super Nintendo. I laughed as a mushroom emerged from one of the boxes and Mario received it, realizing how the makers of the game were implanting ideas of drug use into the minds of the children who played these games. I soon switched games to The Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past. All of the colors were constantly changing, and all of the movement caused me to have a feeling similar to a roller coaster ride, even though I was completely motionless.

Josh and I then proceeded to look at a book of Mandelas, which are pictures meant to aid in meditation. One particular picture caught my eye. The picture consisted of a waterfall, with a man swimming in the water below. Along the forested sides, there is a crocodile on each side of the pool, looking at the man. Well, as I looked at the picture, I could see the man's arms moving as he 'swam', the crocodiles beginning to plunge into the water, and the waterfall moving. And as I looked closer at the picture, the borders between the different colors began to shift, moving back and forth, as though they were 'pushing' one another. I pointed all of this out to Josh, and he laughed, telling me he could see the picture coming to life as well.

Music was quite amazing to us. Normally, Josh and I don't agree so much with music. He's more into classic rock, and I'm into metal. But with the mushrooms, music was perfect, no matter what genre. I put on 'Death Blooms' by Mudvayne, and what a great song it was! I listen to Mudvayne regularly, but the song seemed brand new to me. Josh said, 'What is this music? This is really cool!' It was during this time that I got the best visual hallucination of the entire trip. I looked at the closet doors, and they were moving in a manner similar to that of waves. It was like staring at the surface of a lake on a windy day, but it was happening with his closet doors. This was amazing to me, so I told Josh, and he looked at the doors and saw the same thing.

Josh and I were kind of hungry, but were worried that eating something heavy would ruin the trip, so we decided to make some microwave popcorn. Opening the door and leaving the room was like entering another world. Although Josh's house is very familiar to me, it seemed like it was a whole new place. We walked into the kitchen, avoiding eye contact with his mom, who was in the living room. As the popcorn popped, his mom entered the kitchen. I opened the refrigerator, acting as though I was looking for a drink. She talked to us for a minute, and we managed to avoid looking at her. As the microwave stopped, the screen said 'Enjoy'. I mouthed a 'Thank you' at the microwave, believing the 'Enjoy' was a sincere send-off, and not just something the microwave was programmed to do. People say eating while tripping isn't anything special, but I disagree. Josh and I took our first mouthful, and the taste and texture were so good that we starting laughing because of it, half-chewed popcorn spilling out of our mouths at the same time. We finished and began drinking some root beer when the peak of the experience began.

We turned on the TV, and we had no idea what was happening, once again. It was now impossible to focus on the plot. Whenever anyone moved, they left extremely clear trails, and the images on the screen were extremely distorted. Things seemed to inflate and deflate, and colors were extremely vivid. It wasn't entertaining in the matter that it was supposed to be, but since everything was so altered, it made for a good time. Rather than sitting down, we were just standing in front of the TV; why, I do not know. I looked at Josh, and his face appeared to be half red and half blue. As we watched the TV, we had a deep conversation about life, specifically, what it means to be alive, and we realized the sad truth, which is that life is only defined by a series of chemical reactions within a bundle of atoms. Which is true, by the way; without certain chemical reactions, we would be no different than rocks or the very computer you're staring at right now. It made us feel emotionally cold towards everyone else, but when we discussed it a bit more, we felt such a strong bond with one another. It didn't even feel as though we were two seperate people anymore; rather, it was like we were just one entity, having a beautiful journey as one mind.

After a fruitless effort to get a cigarette, we decided to go to sleep. We were almost completely down by that time. I was confused the next day, being normal. While we were tripping, time had lost it's meaning. I stared at a clock while tripping, and it just looked like numbers in a box, and it was strange to think that time is just a creation of man, that this thing which governs our existance is just numbers in a box, and nothing else. Although my thinking is back to normal, I have to wonder if I do mushrooms enough, will time be nothing?</bodytext></report>
