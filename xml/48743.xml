A friend experienced with GHB offered me some one night at his house. I'd never heard of it, but he told me it had an effect similar to alcohol. He mixed some water with baking soda and added 48 drops of GHB, which was a normal dose for him. This was a big mistake, as I am probably half his size. I drank it anyway because he assured me it wasn't too much, and I started feeling the effects almost immediately. I first got dizzy and was unable to stand up. I lay down and the dizziness increased and I became nauseated. I wasn't able to actually throw up though, so I just lay on the bed feeling awful. Different parts of my body kept getting hot and cold.

My friend covered me with a blanket and I hid my head under it because the brightness of the room had gotten painful. About 20 minutes later I passed out. I awoke about an hour later feeling groggy and still a little dizzy, but within a half hour I was completely fine.

I tried GHB again a week later and only took 14 drops, and felt no effect. At some point I'll give it another go and hopefully I'll get the dosage right.</bodytext></report>
