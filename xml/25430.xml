I ordered a half-ounce of Opium Lettuce. It's hard smoking this with without gagging from the rotten stench of its wet-sock smelling smoke. The unburnt herb itself smells repulsive. I smoked two good joints of this shit, and felt only dizzy and annoyed that I wasn't fucked up.

Opium Lettuce smoke stinks so bad that I had a hard time smelling my pipe afterwards, and was consequently forced to chuck it in the creek, along with the bag of crap I bought.</bodytext></report>
