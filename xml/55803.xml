I used to smoke cannabis on a nightly basis, however in the last year I made a decision to cut down and only do it occasionally (i.e. once or twice every two to three weeks). I cannot express how much melatonin has helped me with this transition.  When I stopped using pot on a daily basis, I was sleepless for about four to five days.  I would lie there but the sleep would not come: only until I passed out from sheer exhaustion.

I am not an insomniac and only have had mild sleeplessness in my life.  The pot is what lulled me to sleep all this time, but now that it was not there I could not sleep. I started taking 3 mg of melatonin about an hour before bed. What A difference!  I fell asleep within 30-45 minutes after lying down and the sleep was uninterrupted until 8 a.m. the next morning.  Occasionally I have grogginess upon waking up in the morning but that depends on when I take the melatonin at night.  Normally I take it around 9 p.m. I don't take it all the time, only when I can't sleep and it always works.</bodytext></report>
