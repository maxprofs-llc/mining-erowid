Not liking the intense nasal burn of 2-cb or the slower onset of oral dosage a friend and i tried smoking it. We spread our usuall nasal dose on a folded piece of tin foil and inhaled the vapor with a straw. care should be used to avoid heating up the foil to much, causing holes. after the first couple hits my heart was racing. After three, echos abound and after four, wow. Effects wore off after about 6 hours and were typical of nasal dosage</bodytext></report>
