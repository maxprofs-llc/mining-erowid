Well, a couple of days ago I posted a message to alt.drugs.ghb asking about Tranquilli-G.  It arrived today; I took about 2.5mL after working from 5:30a.m til' 2:00p.m. Before I took it I was feeling agitated achy, and tired.  It took about 20 min. and I felt something, not excatly sure, but it felt good, I drifted off to sleep and slept for about an hour or so and woke up feeling fairly good. (usually after an afternoon nap I wake up feeling terrible.) So it had some effect on me other than sleepiness. It took some of my aches and pains away before falling asleep also.

I continued to use the Tranquilli-G and found it to be fairly weak.  Although it did definately do something, made ne feel mildly relaxed and helped me sleep.</bodytext></report>
