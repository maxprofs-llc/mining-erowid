The week of labor day 2001 I had made preparations for me and one of my spiritual cohorts to engage the plant teachers associated with the South American brew we know as Ayahuasca.I had done what I determined to be the necessary degree of research along the subject by reading, intuiting, and having conversation with those who had ventured into those realms and lived to tell about it.From the start of the project I was acting on some inner guidance about how to prepare the brew that I can only describe as a knowing of how to go about things without knowing how I knew. Call it what you like.

My belief system accounts for knowledge outside the bounds of linear or logical linguistic based constructs. The brew consisted of: 25G Mimosa hostilis / 250G Banisteriopsis cappi / 50G Psychotria viridis / and 50G Chaliponga (Diplopterys cabrerana).

This brew was cooked over the course of 5 days and some extra whole cappi root was cooked separate and added to the reduction. The quantity of that I can only estimate as about 1 pound by weight.

The water was adjusted with the juice of about 16 limes. Something told me to do this. When the aroma of what I was cooking became apparent, I knew the smell....though I had not experienced it in this lifetime. This stock was cooked down to about 24 ounces.

For reasons I can only describe as insane I had no idea of the power of what I was dealing with and I set out from the beginning to make a brew that would not be ' weak.' As soon as I choked it down, I knew I had gone too far. I left went outdoors instantly knowing that nausea was soon to follow. At 15 minutes I began feeling onset but still managable. I will make point now that it is a mistake in brewing practice to leave heavy sediment in your brew.

At 20 minutes I forced myself to heave. I got back over to the steps by my friends home and found a water hose and rinsed my mouth.

At this point I starckly realized that the brew was too strong.
/n
The landscapes that started to unfold were so vast they were incomprehensible. What was coming in was primal and living. There was something that rang strongly of the plant kingdom but I cannot describe it. Something like was saying ....' The Source.' I was seeing manifold dimensions that are the source of this realm and we are tied to them. Everything was vibrantly alive and there was a vastness that was terrifying.
/n

Before the journey, I had invoked and asked for protection of some extradimensional beings I had thought were allies and friends. When I was by the steps taking water, a voice came in my head or rather a knowing that told me very clearly that the teachings I had been embracing were the most dangerous thing I had encountered and I should promptly burn them! It was at this point that I came into a state of fear that I have never known and hope not to revisit. I got back into the house and realized I had gone way too far and grossly underestimated the power and scope of what can be accessed with ' Yage.' Once inside I realized quickly my support system was shabby and the setting was bad.
/n
/n
I did have friends around, but none that could help me thru what I was getting into. A hard Reptilian Alien prescence that I had encountered before moved in fast. I got into a place where I could not control the nausea. For the duration I probably heaved 34 times.
/n
/n
After I engaged the reptilian agencies at one point I realized I had poisoned myself and I was dying. This was a physical knowing and not a delusion seemingly. My body was overcome with the drink.
/n
/n
I was using water to dilute the poison at every purge. I became dysphoric and was convinced that if I fell asleep I'd never see 3d earth again. The person who was supposed to be helping me thru this was faltering about this time. Part of me was saying you cannot surrender to your death. For roughly 4 hours I fought thought incursion from these Aliens, purged, submerged into some kind of battle realm and was able to surface and tell myself attitude is everything. At some point I began calling on Angels and I renounced my need to know the secrets of what I had opened up. Again direct information was given me by what I can only ascribe as the spirit of the Plant Teacher, and I said thusly...

The Teachings of _ _ are serving to further anchor the intruder races into the material plane....give them up!

Matters of Spirit are simple......

They will go to a place of thier own making....

All the problems we have on the earth plane can be solved...
/n

Your kind is not ready to know some of whats out there...

The horror I faced was like none I've ever seen. I would not wish it on anyone. This was an Astral Battle in the strictest sense. The fact that I'm still alive makes me the victor and I can assure you those buggers were pissed. They want total control over the human race, and they control thru the realms of thought. Somehow I kept pushing them further out to the edges of the plane of contact. I saw future versions of Terra that were completely free from the corruption that is commonplace today. People loved each other and the Earth and all was in harmony. I do not expect that others will have to deal with this sort of thing necessarily. It is my belief that some of us basically signed up for extreme duty because we had some latent talent to face it down. Woe be to any who think we are alone in this big game, or that these are the ravings of one deranged.
/n
The bottom line is we can win this time if we can remember ourselves. Some of us came back from the future to change the course of this timeline. That I know. Matters of Spirit are simple. I hope this helps someone.</bodytext></report>
