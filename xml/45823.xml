I examined the packets of various bags of herbs and decided to buy a packet of 'Bliss Out' (aka dried and chopped Damiana) and some rolling papers. I rolled a joint Damiana and a little  while waiting for the train.

It tasted slightly unpleasant, its something that grows on me. Over the course of getting back to where I was staying by train I smoked two more joints. I decided that I had wasted 15 bucks and that it did squat. I made two cups of tea (seeped two teaspoons in boiling water for a few minutes water, strain, add honey) and smoked two more joints, watched a movie and went to bed.

I had the best night. I didn't get up till two the next day, it was like having erotic dreams on tap. I didn't notice any high and if there is one its very mild.</bodytext></report>
