Id been excited about taking my first E all day after hearing so much about it, to the point that Id been looking at my watch every 10 minutes or so all afternoon. When the time finally came, I walked to the bus stop and took a bus to meet 4 friends at the ferry port. The atmosphere on the bus only made me more excited, because it was full of people going to the same place, all equally excited and talking about how much they had been looking forward to this party. I was offered pills by 3 different people, but I declined as I had already paid for mine from one of the people I was going to meet.

When the bus arrived, I looked around for my friends at the ferry port and found them quickly, I was the 3rd of 5 people in our group to arrive. We were all happy to see each other and looking forward to the night ahead. After about 20 minutes the other two arrived and we walked straight onto the ferry, and in 30 minutes arrived on the island. We hopped onto a bus and were at the party area in another half an hour. So, we all showed our tickets, and walked into the arena which was filling up quickly, and already quite full. We found our own spot right next to one of the huge speakers with a good view of the DJ stage. We stood around talking, discussing the night ahead and who was taking what and how much, but were interrupted by the DJ who appeared on his set, and within five minutes was churning out the tunes.

The volume was louder than anything I had ever heard. I kept looking around and saw just about everyone in the crowd making the same movementreaching into pockets, taking something out, and swallowing it. I decided to wait for about 20 minutes to get accustomed to the crowd and environment while my 4 friends all took their pills together (who I will call K, G, M and J). K, big guy who had a bad experience on the stuff few months ago, took just 1, G, tall Trance-fanatic and regular raver took 2 with another 3 for later on, J who had organized the trip and got us the drugs also took 2 with 3 for later on, and M - the girl in our group - took 1 with 2 to go for later.

I couldnt stop looking around at the crowd, there were thousands of people. I went to the toilets (yuck) so nature wouldnt have to interrupt the fun later. I came back to find everyone in the group dancing and smiling and grinning at me, gesturing for me to join themso, I popped the pill at about 10pm. The laser show was incredible, casting beams of coloured light all over the crowd, the big circular display of lights pulsating and throbbing to the beat like some kind of spaceship. The setting of the place itself was perfect, lots of trees, light blue and orange and pink ambient lights and modern architecture, with different levels connected by walkways, and elevated areas for people to stand and dance on. The music was unbelievable, the mixing perfect, the mood just right, and I felt so glad Id decided to come. I was quite sure the pill hadnt had any effect on me yet, but Id been forcing myself to dance just a bit so as not to look stupid.

About 15 minutes passed, I was still amazed at the size of the crowd and all different types of people who had comeclose to us there were what looked like married couples in their 30s, and even a 70 or so year old woman holding onto a rail and moving like there was no tomorrow. We even saw a couple of the massive security guys looking left and right, popping pills, and moving their heads to the beat while looking out over the crowd! What happened next made my heart skip a beat in joyI looked down, and my feet and legs were moving without me even thinking about it! I noticed that I was moving my arms around as well. I felt a slight tingling, warm, buzzing sensation throughout my body that was pleasurable. I looked up at my friends who were all grinning at me, and I grinned back. This was it! I found myself thinking that this was all great, I was so happy I had good friends to share the experience with, so overjoyed that so many people - complete strangers from all walks of life - can come together in one place for the same purpose.

I closed my eyes and told myself that I had to make the most out of this night, told myself that I wanted the euphoria I was feeling to multiply by 100. The second I thought that, I actually felt the sound waves of the music drifting over me. It felt as if my heart began to beat to the music, I really cant describe it. I looked around and everybody was doing their own thing, not a care in the world, so I let all my inhibitions go and started moving properly. All 5 of us werent talking at this point (couldnt have over the music anyway), but were looking into each others eyes every now and then, and I felt that we all understood each other perfectly. I felt as if I could read their thoughts and we were communicating with each other that way, hard to describe, but that was really cool.

Random people walking past were touching us on the back, stomach, arms...people who were there alone asked to join our group and we danced all together. People hugged us and the urge to hug them in return was very strong, I felt nothing wrong even with hugging other guys, which seemed perfectly normal then but a bit dodgy when looking back at it now. I found it so easy to talk to and get on with random people, which I would have trouble doing sober. We chatted and smiled and danced freely, as if we had been friends for ages. It was absolutely incredible. Nothing could have ruined my mood. To top it all off, M - the gorgeous girl who Id liked for a long time - kept holding onto my hands while she danced and by the end of it we were all over each other, dancing together for ages. The way she moved, twirling around right in front of me and moving all over the place, looking at me over her shoulder thru the corner of her eye with this cheeky grin, it was driving me wild. That's another thing I found actually...my sex drive went through the roof! I don't want to sound crude but I would happily have got funky with her right there.

Every time a good song was played and the bass came on, all the people started jumping up and down like mad together, we were punching our fists and in the air like our lives depended on itand when it drifted into a more relaxed trance we all closed our eyes started waving our arms and moving gentlyand then when the bass came back, jumping around again. Just amazing. It was like we were all one breathing, living, entity living off each others joy and energy. I could feel the love and rhythm of the crowd so well.

At about midnight the others took the rest of their pills and I borrowed one from J, because we didnt have any left and I didnt expect to take more than one that night. It went on, each minute just as good, and we continued dancing and smiling, loving the environment and each other until 5am. The moment the DJ stopped playing live mixes felt as disappointing as failing a final exam. We literally had drag ourselves back to the bus at 5am, the urge to continue dancing to even the crappy pre-set tracks was strong. The journey back was horrible, not only because we were exhausted, but because it seriously felt like we were going to prison after our new-found freedom.

To sum it up, Ive never felt so happy in 4 years. I really think that whatever was left of my depression has gone. Being a shy person Ive realized that if I can lose my inhibitions and get on comfortably with complete strangers with a simple pill, then I can do it without drugs as well. Having been thru this unique experience we are all closer as friends in a new way.</bodytext></report>
