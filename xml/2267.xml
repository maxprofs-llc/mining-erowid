It was a cozy and rainy night, and we had planned to go off to a mountaintop to view the Leonid meteor storm, but my levitation skills are a bit rusty.....so we get out the little packet from over the ocean which a friend had so kindly given us, dig out the Pihkal and read the scanty accounts provided. (Seems that Pihkal sees 2ct2 as an inferior (though ok) version of 2ct7 - prayers are sent to the chemistry gods for that one....)

Slow coming on, took an hour to feel anything at all, and 2 hours to get really into it. Then a visit to all of my current issues, becoming aware of the feelings for each issue yet oddly more like thinking about the feelings rather than experiencing them. Uncomfortable, cuz the issues are uncomfortable. My partner did likewise, but not much discussion.

Then 3 - 4 hours of intense discussion of all aspects of our lives and relationship. Ayn Rand would have been proud of us! A very clear laser like objectivity, deeply truthful, cleansed of all emotions and yet in no way obscured. We talked about EVERYTHING....

I had done an acid journey a couple of weeks earlier, with a number of incomplete processes as a result. 2ct2 cleared these up most emphatically.
