I'm a 17 year old in high school, and i love drugs. Im sure about 3/4s of american teens can say that, but alot of them do drugs just to 'get fucked up'. Hell, i do too sometimes, but sometimes I use them, usually whe I'm alone, to help meditation or just to chill out and explore different realms of awareness. I used to be into psychadelics, then stimulants, and now i Guess i'n going through my sedative stage. Anyway, my drug of choice these days is usually pills (other than herbs, which i dont call a drug). Ive popped oxycontins, percocets, percodans, lortabs, xanax, valium, got damn buspar, and mostly everything else out there other than morphine. I dont think I'm a fiend, I'm just really fond of opiates and sedatives.  So one night my old bud Wes is talkin to me online and asks me what Percocet is (I'm known at school for bein a pharmacutical mastermind). He pops two, has a great night, and gives me two the next day. It was a thursday, my mom was gonna be gone durin the evening, so i bought an eigth of mids and got ready to chilllll out. I didnt eat for 3 hours, drank only water, and made sure i didnt take any other medications that day. I get home at about 7 30 pm, break two 
/n
7.5/325 percocets in half and take all 4 halves.
/n
/n
7:45- Sitting in fron of the computer, got that chill feeling I get when im bracin myself for some good chemical fun, but no real drug-induced feelins yet
/n
8 05- Yeaaaah. Im startin to feel alittle somthin somthin. Just that initial feeling in my head.
/n
8 13- My thoughts are alittle cloudy, but as always, I'm gettin more talkative. I start a few deep conversations with some friends.
/n
8 25- My tolerance must have gone down alittle, I'm feelin real nice. I've only been takin Tylenol 3's lately, so i suppose oxycodones doin it better. My head feels real clear, yet cloudy at the same time. I guess its just the lack of stress and negative vibes.
/n
8 33- The body feeling hit me. I'm warm and fuzzy in my legs, and its spreadin upwards. My respirations slowed down alittle.
/n
8 40- Took a nice long piss, noticed my pupils constricted. Go back to the computer and continue deep talks. One thing about pills for me is I always feel so in tune and harmonious with everyone and everything. Kinda like I reach a deeper level of awareness, but no revelations, just good feelings.
/n
/n
9 10- Ok, maybe my tolerance didnt go away, the chill feelings are diminishin already. So i pop a Tylenol 3 (30mgs codeine phosphate).
/n
9 40- 30 minutes later, the tylenols buzz is kinda overpowerin the percocet. But i still feel real nice.
/n
9 50- Maybe I'm aiming alittle high, but fuck it, im in the mood to get straight gone. I pack up 2 bowls of some nice mids i got from the mexican connection. I'm white and i dont speak spanish, but i work at a mexican restraunt somehow. I think it's becuase i teach them english. And they give me super cheap prices on decent buds.
/n
10 05 -Packed one more bowl, and the paranoia struck deep. Suddenly my legs are shaking, my respiration is seriously depressed, and my pupils are tiny. I cant tell if I'm paranoid cuz I'm worried about mixin two different opiates, or if its just the herbs.
/n
10 20- Tried to watch some TV, couldnt concentrate, so i turned it off and turned on my blacklight and layed back to chill out. Vivid images came when i closed my eyes, and i could change them at will, but they flowed freely if i didnt try to control them. Random parts of my body were having little seizures, i figure its the pills. Moderate paranoia, and bad dry mouth. So i get up and get some water 
/n
/n
10 24- I walk back into my room and into the blacklight and WHAM. Its like the THC, the oxycodone, and the codeine all peaked at once. I stumbled into my bed and layed back. I drifted in and out of reality and a very comfortable dreamland. Im still kind of worried about overdosin or somthin, but its probably remanants of the paranoia, and it floats away with all my other worries
/n
10 30- The world is mine
/n
???- As the night progressed, i was barely breathing at all. I didnt mind though, i was floating around, burrowing deep into my mind, or suddenly drifting into space when i closed my eyes. I contemplate turning on some music, but the silence sounds... different. Like silence actually has a sound, or maybe it was the hum of the blacklight.
/n
2 am - Good lord, suddenly its 2am. I cant tell if i fell asleep or just drifted away for awhile, but im back. then im gone.
/n
/n
Summary- Overall, it was a really good experience. But i wouldnt recommend mixing opiates. When i woke/got up (i dont even know if i fell asleep at all) i had a slight headache and light still hurt my eyes alittle. I always smoke weed at night to go to sleep, or take some pills, but i think i was chasin a high and went about it the wrong way. 
/n
/n
From now on I'm just gonna stick with just oxycodone or just codeiene, no mixin. I'm glad i didnt drink a beer or anything, or my respiration might have stopped. All in all, it was a good time, nothin too dangerous, just a learnin experience.</bodytext></report>
