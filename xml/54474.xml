0:00h  I ingested 90mL of 40% alcohol for the first time on an empty stomach with some friends.

~0:05h  There is a warm feeling in my throat, face, and stomach due to the dilation of capillaries and the irritating effects of the alcohol. There is also a mild sense of well being, nothing major at this point.

/n
~0:10h  The effects are apparent now, I am dizzy, red in the face, euphoric, and am noticing a loss of inhibition.

~0:30h  We decide to go for a walk, walking is not difficult but my balance is off, my vision has become blurry and it is hard to focus. I notice I am a lot more social than I would be otherwise I am also in a lot less control of my person, I like my inhibitions.
/n
/n
~1:00h  The effects are mostly the same at this point, it is pleasurable, there is a pleasant feeling throughout my body but I am not able to let go of the feeling that I am not in control, I suppose if you where to drink enough this feeling would go away and you wouldnt care, but I dont find that to be a desirable effect.
/n
/n
~2:00h  I am slowly regaining control, the experience has not been overly intense, but I was able to get a feel for the drug, and can extrapolate what a higher dosage would be like, I dont think I will be trying more anytime soon.

/n
~4:00h  Baseline.

Aftereffects  I feel fine today, there was no hangover but I didnt expect one from the amount I ingested. Alcohol is a very interesting substance, it is a depressant and yet most people dont even consider it to be a drug. Although I found my experience enjoyable I did not like the loss of inhibitions associated with it, anything that can make you lose control like that scares me.</bodytext></report>
