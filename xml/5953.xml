6pm I took only about 1 1/2 tbsp at first, thats all I could get down cause its some nasty stuff. I waited about two hours, not feeling a thing, then decided to smoke some since I had a lot left.

9pm emptied out 4 cigarettes and filled them with nutmeg, then went and smoked them. before I finished the first one I started to feel nice and relaxed and heavy. It felt like a nice, mild weed high but without the jitteryness I get from weed. Just relaxed, not caring about much of anything. I also felt like I was in a dream, like I was watching a movie from inside my head. I knew what was going on and I appeared to have control over my actions, but anything I made myself do took lots of effort.

2am By the time I went to bed I was starting to perceive everything I saw a bit differently, but no distinct visuals.

1pm (next day) Woke up 13hrs later, still felt calm, but not as intense as when I went to bed. I think I missed the most intense part while I was sleeping. The rest of the day everything was pretty close to normal, but occasionally something in my peripheral vision would look out of place until I focused on it.

I had none of the vomiting/dizziness others have reported from taking nutmeg, so it was a really pleasant experience. I'm just glad I planned ahead so I had a couple days to return to normal.</bodytext></report>
