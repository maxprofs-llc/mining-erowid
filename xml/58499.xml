2006 was a interesting year, and in the summer of that year I got to experience a Grand Mal seizure. To keep things short, Dilantin is my prescription for seizure medication, and everyday I take 300 miligrams of phenytoin. I know there are alot of anti-seizure medication out there but Dilantin hasnt treated me bad in the 6 months of using. When I first started taking the 300 mg's it whould put me down (sleep) for a few hours with the combination of smoking marijuwana on a regular basis.

Within a  month my body became adjusted to the dilantins tweeking and I started to notice a few effects from it. Other then getting tired I found tasks such as reading and writing alot more enjoyable and easier. The best way I can describe it is being more mentally alert, and since its use and effects have been noticed I've been more focused on knowledge. Not a bad drug for a pot head but, its long term effects are serious enough to consider a switch to another medication though.</bodytext></report>
