To begin, I want to say that I am not on any medications, and that I had not taken any medications at least three days before this experience. I am also a usually happy person, and I was definitely happy about going into this experience. I didnt have a negative mindset the least bit. I surrounded myself with people I love and trust, and I was overall content with my life. To give you an idea of where I was during this experience, I live in a dorm, and my dorm is softly lit from one corner. I also have a comfy carpet, and an overall nice, soft, living space.

These times are just estimates because I wasnt watching the clock all night.

I crushed up 15 Ololiuqui seeds (LSA), and  of a gram of Syrian Rue seeds (MAOI), and put them into a tiny jar with about an ounce of water in it. I shook the jar every once and a while to mix it up.

I took two Dramamines so I wouldnt throw anything up.

I drank the contents of the tiny jar, including all of the crushed seeds. It didnt taste bad, it just tasted like dirty water with crushed up seeds in it (thats what it looked like too).

I smoked a bowl of MJ with a friend from across the hall, and we were both feeling really stoned. I had a strong body high, and I was really tingly all over.

The feeling of the LSA first started to overpower the MJ, and time started to slow down. I was eating a pretzel, feeling myself breathe, and I noticed it was taking longer and longer to chew the pretzel and to take one breath. The people in my room started to talk slower also. I decided to open up the clock on my computer to watch the second hand move by, and it was moving about twice as slow as it should have been moving, which was really weird.
/n
/n
I was a little scared at first. I thought maybe I shouldnt have done this combination of drugs, but I went over it in my head, and I knew I had done my research, and that I was going to be just fine. I was a little worried about the MAOI, but I knew I put only half a gram in for a reason. I was also a little worried about the Dramamine, but I knew it was perfectly fine for me. After I rationed my way through that, I felt fine.

Spatial hallucinations started now, too. I turned around from my computer and looked at the people in my room. They looked huge, and I felt huge with them, like we were giants, and then I noticed my room looked different too. I looked at the back corner of my room, and it looked like it was miles away. I decided to get up and go to the room across from mine. The people playing video games on the floor looked huge, but the back of the room was miles away. I noticed as I was walking around that my body started to feel a bit heavier, and the LSA was taking more control over my body. I think the drowsiness of the Dramamine was also kicking.

Only ten minutes had gone by, but it felt like I was across the hall forever. I put on Colin Hay, and I decided to just lie on my bed for a while, I closed my eyes. When I laid down on my bed, I started to reach the peak of the experience. I started to twitch all over my body. I wasnt convulsing, but just twitching everywhere. My body would twitch in patterns and waves. My hips would twitch up, and that would send a wave down my legs and up by torso, it was weird.
/n
/n
My thoughts were also going wild. I would think about everything, like my mind was running around uncontrollably. I would think about how I ate the pretzel earlier just as long and importantly as how much I loved my friend. Time was also slowed down a lot. I had my hands on my chest, so I could feel myself breathe and my heart beat. It felt like an entire minute was in-between every breath, and my heart would beat every 5 seconds. I knew that my lungs and my heart were probably acting normally, just time was slowed down a lot.
/n
/n
Another neat thing happened with the music that was playing. It sounded like I could hear everything in the music equally, like every note in a chord, and every instrument, loud and soft. Because time was slowed down so much, it felt like I had enough time to analyze every little part of the music individually. I only put on one song, so it ended after what felt like a long while, even though it was only about three minutes long. When I went to bed, everyone moved into the room across from mine, so all I could hear were the muffled voices from across the hall.

T 1:45

This was the peak of the experience. My body was still twitching in waves, and my thoughts were still running everywhere. Time was still going very very slow. I started to have audio hallucinations now. I could hear the people across the hall, but it sounded like they were talking through a megaphone or a walky-talky. Then their voices would begin to chop up or turn into droning, and all of a sudden their voices would stop and all I would hear was electrical noises.
/n
/n
There were a lot of different electrical noises, like electrical noises from a movie or something, it wasnt just a consistent buzzing or droning, it changed a lot between droning, buzzing, zapping, or any combination of those. The sound of the people across the hall and the electrical noises alternated back and forth about ten times, and then the electrical noises never came back. I was still twitching all over, and my mind was still running.

The peak was now fading away, and I looked at my clock and noticed that only 17 minutes had gone by since I got into my bed! It felt like at least three hours had gone by. The twitching stopped soon, and I was able to sit up in my bed. I could tell I was tired from the Dramamine, and my body still felt a little on edge from the LSA. I still felt all tingly from the weed, too. My friend called when I sat up in bed, and I was able to hold a conversation with her, but I still felt really weird and my mind was still trying to run everywhere. There were still remnants of the spatial distortions too, my bed seemed huge, but my door, which is on the other side of the room, seemed like it was miles away. After I got off the phone with my friend, I just chilled out for a while.

Time isnt going as slow as it was during the peak, but its still going as slow as when the LSA first started to kick in, it went this slow for the rest of the night, but I got used to it. The special distortions were gone by now, and so was the twitching, but my body was still a little achy from it. I decided to take a shower, and it felt great because I was still stoned. After my shower, I talked to a couple people around in the hall and a couple friends in the room across from mine, and then went back into my room, because I found that I didnt like being around people and in the bright light.

Me and my friend smoked another bowl of MJ to chill out for the rest of the night, we felt awesome.

My friend called back after she had gotten ready for bed, and I talked to her until she got tired and wanted to go to bed. My thoughts werent running now, so I could hold a conversation with her just fine. Then I just chilled out with a couple people in my room until I went to bed. It wasnt hard to sleep because I was really stoned, and still tired from the Dramamine.

Conclusion:
/n
In conclusion, I liked doing Ololiuqui. I wouldnt say it was a really fun or desirable experience, and I definitely wouldnt say it was a bad experience, but I would say it was really cool, and neat. I dont think I would spend money for shipping only for Ololiuqui seeds, Id have to be buying something else that I need first. On the other hand, if I need some more Syrian Rue or Fly Agaric, I would definitely throw in some Ololiuqui seeds.

A couple things I would do differently: I think if I ever do this again, I would not do it high. I think the tinglyness of my body was too much during the peak of the LSA. I would also only take one Dramamine, because two of them made me tired, and I think one would work as far as me throwing up. The weed and the Dramamine together also made my mouth really dry, which isnt fun when youre eating pretzels.</bodytext></report>
