There is almost no way of describing a DPT trip, but I will atempt it. There were five of us, including myself, and we had been planning to take about 60 milligrams via insufflation. We cut up the drug without the use of scales, but it seems that we all took around 60 mgs. We then proceeded into a single room to wait for the trip to come and put on some dancy techno to set the mood. I remember the CD starting and I also remember feeling extreme dizziness and lightheadedness almost immeadiatly after intake.

After about 5 or 10 minutes the trip came. Immeadiatly, I began experiancing extreme visuals and traces. As I would look around the room, I would see the other 4 people mostly sitting with their eyes closed, all with puzzled looks on their faces. After about 5 minutes of this daze I was completely plunged into another world. The techno music proved to be way too much on the senses, so someone decided to put on Delerium - Karma instead, which was perfect. I remember insane visuals, dazzling colors, and shifting patterns. I was moving around on the floor, attempting to fit my body into these patterns. At some times I felt extrodinary amounts of pain and fear and almost right after that I would feel extreme amounts of bliss and happiness. These feelings would shift back and forth almost constantly for what seemed about an hour. During this time I became aware of the intense burning sensation in my nose. The hardest thing to explain is the way that all senses became visuals. If I would feel something on my skin, it would spin into a visual, also, everytime the chords would change on the music, the visuals would shift completely.

I remember at one point, someone turned off the lights in the room and I felt extreme panic until they were turned on again. After about an hour and a half of writhing around on the floor and shaking uncontrollably, I came out of this visual world and back into the room that I was in. There was vomit all around me (I had planned not to eat 4 hours beforehand but I had vomited anyway). For the next 2 hours I was coming down off of the drug and it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Every room in the house was filled with swirling colors and designs. I remember feeling very happy during these 2 hours and forgot all of the problems in my life. This part was not as intense as the peak, and I was able to function in semi-normal ways. All signs of the drug were gone 4 hours after consumption and I felt at peace with myself and with everyone else there. Overall, it was a very mind-opening experience and I would do it again, but I would definitely do it on an empty stomach to prevent vomiting.

This is definitely not for everybody. The intensity of the peak may be too much for some people and they might think something is wrong with them when they begin to shake uncontrollably and find themselves unable to return to the real world.</bodytext></report>
