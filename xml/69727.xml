Took 1 10mg pill, 20min later starting to feel relaxed. Listening to music sounds better than usual. I am becoming super relaxed to the point that I don't want to move. Feels like the come down after smoking marijuana. Can't feel my body much, so relaxing very comfy. Kinda sleepy but not so sleepy that I need to go to bed. I feel this relaxed state for about 2hr then I start to come out of it. I like it and will do it again next time. 20mg though.</bodytext></report>
