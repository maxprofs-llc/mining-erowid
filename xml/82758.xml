I was prescribed Wellbutrin for major depression about two weeks ago. Despite the many negative reports I've read about snorting it, I thought I'd give it a try. I removed the coating off one of my SR 150mg tabs and crushed it into a fine powder. It burns, but nothing too bad, and its quickly numbed (local anesthetic effect). It leaves me with a high not that dissimilar to cocaine, but with slightly less euphoria. I personally enjoy it, but don't do it too often due to the fact I don't want to build up a huger tolerance. Just wanted to pitch in my two cents.</bodytext></report>
