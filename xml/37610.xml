To start off with I have a very high tolerance to drugs of all kind so please don't try this at home without heavy drug use experience and tolerance. I have been on legal narcotics, tranquilizers, uppers and more. I have a full cornucopia of drugs that I take everyday for the past 17 years. The opiates for the past 3 years. I have a spinal disease that requires frequent doctor visits so bring out that bottle of saline and rinse my nasal passages out with it so the doc can't tell, he just thinks I use to much Dristan decongestant. Out of all drugs, Oxycontin is my favourite though.

This experience was intense. It started at 11 am after I picked up my meds at the pharmacy. I was craving Oxycontin so I took 3 whole then waited 1 hour for those to kick in then I crushed 2 Oxycontins (20mg's) with a dime on a piece of paper making sure it was a fine powder easily absorbably by my nasal passages. After I snorted it evrything became harmonious, I sing professionally so that is a good word, after 3 minutes. It felt like my whole body was in tune with my surroundings not to mention I was severely fucked up. I lost coordination and had to lay down on the sofa listening to music in which to this day I couldn't tell you what was playing!

The effects of the Oxies mellowed out to a smooth enoyable unique euphoria which was about to get even more unique. I took 150mg of Demerol. I take Demerol for as needed pain medicine 75 mg to 150 mg every 6 hours. I also took 5 Lectopams = bromazepam(not available in USA)and 4 Xanax .5 mg's on 2 Pina Coladas. In 30 minutes I was higher than a what I get off of heroin (I tried it twice before). My body was limp and in tune with everything. I didn't care about anything. I just cared about the warm feeling the drugs were giving me.

Things seemed distant, the music and spacial distortions grasped a hold of me. I knew I was on the verge of ODing but I could care less. I was in complete oblivion and it felt great. I started to dissociate and had an outer body experience, I just watched myself lying helplessly on the sofa. The mix of drugs were perfect as well as the alcohol for an added effect. All the depressant drugs taking hold of every neuron in my body. I was in perfect harmony and the buzz was never to be forgotten.

The Demerol really added to to the effect of lucid dreaming that I sometimes don't get on Oxies alone. I had my eyes closed and different visuals had taken effect. It was like I was an eagle flying over the Canadian Rockies. I saw it was cold but felt warm sorta a mixing of dream and reality. I was in a delerium where anything was possible with my eyes closed. The lucid state continued for at least 3 hours. I was getting very tired so I decided to take some Dexedrine, 3 10mg spansules to keep the euphoria but diminish the sedative effect.

When the amphetamines started working 30 minutes later I was still high as a kite but they produced a sense of 'I can do anything in the world feeling'. The euroriant effects of the narcotics were still there as well as the traquilizers but I had an overwhelming sense of joy better than the best of orgasms! I didn't care about anything and I was in complete anagesia from my spinal disease. I told you I have a legit reason for having such incriminating drugs on hand in large quantities. My marijauna is also legal too. The Canadian Goverment gave me permission to use it under my doctor's care.

When I was coming down after about 4 1/2 to 5 hours from the snorted Oxies and Demerol I fired up a pipe and toked out of my bong. This made the whole experience come down with a gentle ease. I recommend grass to anyone coming down off a narcotic (opiate) also Rohypnol or Lectopam from past experiences. The pot made my mind glitter in the mix of depressants and produced a final lucid like state that kept me  dreaming whilst awake (the Dexedrine).

After looking back at this whole orgasmic experince I don't regret it. I'm just thankful I didn't die. I slept good that night with wierd dreams happening to me. It was so real. I woke up the next day ready for my next adventure without a hangover (I got worried with the alcohol). I went to work the next day well rested and when I got home I sniffed some more Oxies. It never ends that is what addiction does to you, I'm just fortunate that I'm on disability and recieve my meds for free with a seemingless endless supply without having to resort to the street where danger lies and expensive prices dwell. I do Oxies everyday whole usually but 1/3 of the time I sniff them they give me pain relief as well as the best euphoria out there. It will knock you on your ass especially combined with other substances!</bodytext></report>
