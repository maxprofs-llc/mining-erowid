If you are familiar with scuba diving, then you probably know about nitrogen narcosis.  It basically occurs while your scuba diving, usually at deep depths.  It is just a random feeling of intoxication that occurs.

I was on a trip to Belize and we were at a scuba diving area with many sharks.  The maximum depth was 130.  As we were descending, at about 90 feet, I began to feel a bit confused and dizzy.  I didn't really think much of it until I realized it was nitrogen narcosis.  I've been intoxicated many times, so I felt as if I could control myself.  They tell you that if you get 'narc-ed' you should ascend until you feel normal, but I was feeling so happy that I just kept descending with the rest of the group.  It was a great feeling.  Every time I breathed out, my bubbles sounded musical.  I actully laughed underwater at how funny this was.  It felt like pure bliss in the deep, blue water with black-tip sharks swimming around me everywhere.  The sharks were pretty much harmless I guess.  The whole experience felt like a big dream and I was still a little confused when we reached the surface.  I just sat on the boat thinking about what happened.

Overall, it was definitely a fun experience.</bodytext></report>
