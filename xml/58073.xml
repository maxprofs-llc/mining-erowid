During my freshman year of college, I started experimenting more and more with drugs, for various reasons. I had little experience with the subject matter, that summer I had smoked pot for my first time, which I proceeded to do whenever I got the chance, and previously used to do whippets when at work (we used them to make whipped cream). Anyway, shortly before the end of my first semester, I talked to a my psychologist about going on medication for my ADD again, hoping it would help me study more. He prescribed me a new medication, similar to ritalin, but from my understanding more potent. I went back to school, bottle of pills in hand, and thats where the trouble started.

After attempting to research the drug online and finding reports of similar drugs being snorted for a high, yet nothing about this one (it was very new, and just beginning to hit the market), I decided to try it out. After opening the capsule, I discovered the medication was not a powder as I had expected, rather, it was hundreds of tiny balls, each roughly a millimeter round. Being away at school in a dorm, I made my own mortar and pestle out of a shooter glass and a ceramic cereal bowl. After about 15 mins of steady grinding, I poured the powder out and used a notecard to form 2 small lines of the powder, snorted both, and wound up pacing the room back and forth for about 10 minutes talking non-stop about how I wasnt sure if the drug had worked or not. Clearly it had.

I did it a few more times at school, and then at home for xmas break. One night comes to mind in which I snorted a copious amount and actually got a nice 15 minute body buzz and felt mentally very warm and content, something I hadn't felt before. I also spent a solid 3 hours typing a memoir of my life, as well as emailing it to my favorite author at the time and asking for an opinion. It was a very interesting experience, to say the least. A few days later I tried it again when my best friend stayed the night to drink. He wound up falling asleep shortly after I snorted about 3 or 4 pills all in about 5 minutes, and a few shots of vodka. I spent literally 9 hours sitting in my boxers, on the floor of my basement with my laptop typing 13 more pages to that same memoir, all based off of my life experiences. I went upstairs at about 10.15 the next morning to shower, and I believe I had a mild case of hypothermia from sitting in my cold basement with no shirt or pants for so long in the same position.

One experience comes to mind though, that didnt turn out so well. Back at school one night, with nothing to do, I decided to take a couple bumps of focalin, hoping for that nice warm buzz I had gotten at home. I dont remember how much I took, and I know it wasnt the most Ive taken before, but things took a turn for the worst. After about 10 minutes or so of feeling very wired and energetic, I began to feel a sort of pressure building in my chest. Eventually, I noticed it felt like my chest was being gradually compressed, and breathing was becoming difficult. Somewhat frightened, I started to lay down on my futon, thinking a nap would be nice but knowing due to the nature of the drug sleep would be impossible for several hours. Not only that, but a sudden understanding that if I went to sleep, I would surely die gripped me.

Quite shaken up and worried about what was happening, I decided to call my girlfriend, who lived back at home and I was going through some very turbulent times with. I noticed she was online though, and decided to use AIM to talk instead. This whole time I had noticed a severe tension in my body, which made itself terrifyingly apparent when I couldnt get my hands to unclench from the fist they had been forming for the last 10 minutes or so. Typing was impossible. I used so much effort keeping my fingers from retracting that I couldnt hit any of the keys. I tried calling her instead, she knew something was wrong, and called the room phone immediately. I could barely hold the phone in my tight fist, and actually squeezed it out of my hand several times. I clung with my other arm to the top of my loft for support, speaking in quick, breathless outbursts as I struggled to breathe normally. My girlfriend became very afraid of what was happening, and told me to call 911 if it was so bad. I rode it out on the phone with her though, and after about 10 more minutes of talking things got better. My hands loosened up, my chest felt less compressed, and I began to breathe normally again.

I used focalin a handful of times after this experience, in much smaller doses. I have since stopped taking it to prevent this from happening again.</bodytext></report>
