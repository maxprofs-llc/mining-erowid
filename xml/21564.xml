30 minutes after taking the drug began feeling body aches. Lay down but felt antsy and had to move. Got multiple head rushes, couldnt communicate my pain and experienced mild, but alarming hallucinations, both open eyed and closed. Eventually fell asleep but effects lingered untill several days after. Seroquel, a treatment for schitzophrenia, is effectively anti-ectasy in that it deprives the brain of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, the drugs effects correspond with this theory. It's a hard lesson I had to learn the hard way, I'm posting this with hopes that no one else should have to.</bodytext></report>
