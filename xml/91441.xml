In south Georgia the local head shops sell these capsules (pill) that are labeled as a sex stimulant (not really though) it is called day lights, but it did have an older very similar pill called night light but got banned. Anyway a personal dose is half the powder in the pill so, I put my half of the powder in half the capsule and swallow it. It took bout 15 to 30mins before it kicked in. It feels very much like MDMA. It gave me the feel good feeling, also I felt stimulated, but my heart did not have that uncomfortable fast heart beat like MDMA (and I am not much of a stim user). It also dilates my eyes, and somtimes when walking my legs feel numb. But over all it is just like MDMA. I am on it right now... it lasts quite a few hours (sorry dont know the right amount of duration). Music is a must with this, and alot of gum is a must cause my jaw feels like I must chew somthing! weed or spice blend is great 2 go with as well. Oh yeah I will also never fell like I can stop talking and makes my emotions go wild!!!!!!</bodytext></report>
