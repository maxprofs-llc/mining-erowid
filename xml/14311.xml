Like other discoveries related to lysergides it seems, happened without planning. Originally an idea occurred to soak the seeds in water first to take off the husks easily, which worked fine. Then after cutting them into fourths with a 'utility' (a.k.a. fuckin' sharp) knife and letting them soak in the water some, the new discovery happened. The soaking allowed the actual shells of the seeds to sort of strip away, one could remove them easily by just squeezing them off, leaving the actual soft kernel. Rad! Then after throwing out the shells and allowing the soft kernel to soak produced a tea with distinctly less of that abdomen-churning pastey-floral smell. High hopes.

Unfortunately some miscommunication with another friend occurred so we didn't end up tripping at the same time and plans changed anyways, so the tea finally became ingested at 10:00 AM. The tea had thirteen seeds. Less LSA must have gone into the water also, maybe crushing the kernels would help. It came on very strangely. The first few hours had the good news of virtually no nausea at all and only a slight body load, maybe a tiny bit of stomach discomfort, but the effects didn't seem like much. Getting up things seemed a little weird.

Finally at 12:36 PM a decision had to get made, G often goes weirdly and unpredictably with LSA since LSA contains a relaxant, so one must take extreme care but hey not that much had happened yet, admittedly though it did have some typical heart-felt personal advice about a few matters, so already even if nothing much more would have happened it didn't seem like a loss, besides a big big trip didn't seem that desirable, so it as usual seemed just perfect, exactly needed at the time. Anyways at 12:36 just enough G became ingested to feel it and BOOOOOOOooOOoOoOoOoOm!

Don't ask why but that picked it up a notch. Sometimes G seems to dull the effects of LSA, to the point where they return when the G wears off, but sometimes the exact opposite happens and this time it happened. Not the soaring swooping mental vortices of a full thirteen-seed trip but certainly a big improvement. Just lying around, enjoying the ambient music, listening to some Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the radio drama, and turning on Star Trek TNG at 2:00. The G also added a little hilarity which felt quite welcome. The Creator always provides what you need in any given situation and this varies from time to time to place to a space re-placed. After a while around 4:00 or so it sort of had the feel wishing to return to a bit more 'normal' of a state and fortunately an hour's sleep helped, then some food and vitamins and things rounded things off.

When standing up to do things, things did feel a little more fevered as far as vision and not wanting to remain standing for long, but the absence of nausea made it tolerable, just get up to do what needs doing then lie back down in comfort. The stomach feels a little off though that could happen from only getting one meal today thus far. Not sure what Else to say, no big cosmic revelations [yet] though things do seem more open, processing some spiritual projects and projecting some spiritual processes sort of left on the back burner for a while.

LSA doesn't seem like a thing to do a lot but one might argue the plant has that in its design. Every flower has its hour. Oh one interesting thing though, during and even now to a degree a knowing exists maybe half a second ahead of 'now', at first it seemed like telepathy or knowing what someone would say but it happened when watching Star Trek, and when talking to a friend later, like doing pattern matching on the words and filling in what they would say or something, cool. The sub-conscious has re-opened to a pattern UV in-fourmation. Omeron - Effortless Union with the Divine. Think globally, act nonlocally.</bodytext></report>
