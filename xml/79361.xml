My comment relates solely to marijuana drug testing. I am an occasional marijuana user, but when I use it is usually at the level of 3 to 4 joints a night. I have noticed that if I continue this for at least a half ounce of weed that I will test positive for at least 60 days. I have tried multiple over the counter tests which can be purchased at any pharmacy. The only thing somewhat unusual about my body is that I am quite muscular and engage in intense physical activity at least 3 and as much as seven times a week.</bodytext></report>
