On this particular day I had no intent to take any substances other than maybe alcohol.  I would consider myself to have been an alcoholic at this point in my life, episodes occurring mainly every 1-2 weeks.  I had spent the day clearing branches in the yard and building a fire in a fire ring.  I ate supper with my family, and then went outside to light the fire.  It was a pretty chilly night, and the fire and the alcohol synergized just perfectly.  I started drinking around 8pm and by ?12 or 1am had consumed 5 twelve oz. bottles of ale and the very most of a 375ml bottle of gin.

At this point I realized that I was heavily intoxicated.  Way too drunk to go inside and go to sleep.  I did have the remains of what was presumed to be 100mg of 2c-I.  I had had 1 previous attempt with this material.  I had eyeballed, and shot for around 20mg.  I wouldn't say that I liked it the first time, but I thought I might not have taken enough, better to err on the low side.  The feeling was very tactile, and it affected my sense of taste in a neutral/negative way.  I had no visuals and my vision seemed brightened in a neutral/negative way.  Definitely some audio hallucinations.

I went to my room and grabbed out the plastic bag 2c-I.  This material really sticks to plastic.  It looked nearly impossible for me, in my condition, to eyeball a dose the way it was sticking to its self and the bag.  In one terrible lapse of judgment, I stuck the bag in my mouth and started chewing.  This had a very distinct, very chemical taste, and it took about 15 min. of chewing and swallowing a very potent medicine.  I was filled with anticipation as I walked back out to the fire.

All I had to do now was wait.  It's rumored that substance takes up to two hours to reach full effect and I knew that this would hit a lot faster based on the amount.  The first time seemed to take maybe 30-45 minutes.  This I could feel the first effects in 15 minutes.

What happened was, it was cold outside, the fire was going out, and I was quickly losing control over my motor functions.  I was still interested in seeing what would happen.  It had to find some way of keeping warm so I sat inside my vehicle and messed around with a cell phone.  It seems like I sat there for awhile and passed out/dissolved for about 45 minutes to 2 hours.  I was awakened.  It was simply too cold out, and I had to go inside.

I really just wanted it to be a normal night for everyone else.  I lay in bed like I would normally do except I am tripping balls and still very drunk.  It is definitely a lesson to be learned that alcohol and psychedelics, of any nature, do not mix.  My dog knows something is up.  She hates it when I am drunk, not because I am mean, but because I make a fool out of myself and someone or something might get hurt or broken.  I am no longer having fun.  I would rather just pass out but that was an impossibility.

The most intense effects seemed to build for 3-5 hrs., but it was probably more like 3-4 the way it just kept building and building.  I knew that I had made a mistake, and this would be an ordeal.  In this extremely agitated state, I go to the bathroom to make myself puke as much as I can, realizing this too late anyway.  All I can say is there is no way to get comfortable.  If I am laying down, I feel like I should be sitting up.  If the lights are off, I feel like they should be on.  Over and over.

I don't like pulling all-nighters. Everything looks so amazingly crystal clear, but there is a huge weight and empty headedness.  The weight feels like a massive heavenly body named Iodine.  The feeling is that I am trapped in the inescapable grasp of a female intelligence.  It is indescribable but I am in her firm grasp and my entire body is rearranging itself according to her whim.  I can see and feel this, and it feels exactly how I would imagine mercury poisoning feels like.  She is very vain and she makes me smile a lot for no reason except to make me feel vain and to go through my thoughts.

Tactile hallucinations are intense and feels very sticky like plastic.  The very idea of plastic is bad in this state.  I am scared to touch anything plastic because it is static and nasty.  Visuals are slightly boiling textures on a small scale.  It's like pixels about the size of a raindrop that just keep moving around.  Time is slowed way down and I am fully aware of every second.  I am not proud of myself for getting myself into this.  I ate some benedryl.

By morning I was a walking disaster.  I had spent all night in dread and when the sun came up I was imagining things like crazy.  I couldn't tell what my body was doing except full sensory overload.  You can not hide this state from anybody.  All I could do about it is keep walking and walking and walking.  Alright, here the visuals flare out.

There was a new found looseness to the rest of the trip.  Everything was fine and beautiful, but I had literally no connection to my body.  I couldn't tell if I was OK and I was scared shitless.  Maybe a fatal error had occurred.  I really couldn't tell.  I kept trying to just walk it off, but then I may have made a very big mistake. I was asking to go to the hospital.

We went to the hospital because I was having a severe anxiety attack.  I was very concerned that something was not right, however the emergency room equipment was showing that I was pretty normal.  I asked for some benzos and was refused until a urine sample could be taken.  If I had had any benzo beforehand I would have taken it and probably been fine.  Anyway, I was so overloaded that giving a urine sample was a complete impossibility and I could hear everything going on outside the bathroom.

They were giving me IV fluids to make me pee and I still couldn't so guess what.  I got to be held down and get my first catheter.  It was pure dread and felt all most, well, horrible.  After that happened I just laid there writhing in agony.  I think it was very dehumanizing and I withdrew into my own little world.  If I had had any brains left, since I was obviously not in any real critical danger according to the machines, I should have left the emergency room.  I did not protest being held overnight.  It felt like operating my body was confusing.  I finally got a benzodiazepine, Ativan, and I was fine to lay in the hospital bed.  I wasn't released until the next afternoon after waiting to be checked out by a psychiatrist, family doctor, and a counselor.

In hindsight it was an incredibly regrettable intense experience.  The Med bills are expensive and I didn't even see it coming.  To top it all off, because I was lucky, I was in no real medical danger.  There is no need to push this material this high.  And remember that you can't untake a drug.  This experience really took it out of me and I was not back to baseline for 5-6 days.  It wasn't just regular depression either.  I would wake up in the middle of the night and just feel terrible every night for 3-4 nights.</bodytext></report>
