It all started when I had to go to summer school for being lazy in comm arts. Actually I was lazy in all of my subjects for as long as I could remember. I am an avid weed smoker and have experimented with ecstacy 5 or 6 times... I am in high school and summer school didn't seem like it was going to be cool.

I started off on a bad start with the teacher, half assing everything and squeaking by on my assignments. About a week into it I got the perscription for Adderall because i have ADD. After that and from here on out i have got straight A's. That's a big jump from straight F's. Everybody has noticed a big change in my personality and initiative to help others and engage in conversation. Although getting to sleep was hard for about the first 3 months. And in those three months I went from 175 lb. to 135.  I have never been able to do this. I lost most of my appetite for this time and am still combating it and getting it back for the most part. It just took some getting used to i guess. I am now cleaning up and pursuing the airforce where I am going to be Military Patrol, and after that going into law enforcement.</bodytext></report>
