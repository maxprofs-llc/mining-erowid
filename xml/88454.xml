This was my first experience with 2CE.  I couldnt find a report of a single dose this low for 2CE.  I am a firm believer in getting familiar with the shallow end before entering the deep end with any substance.  And of course sharing these experiences is equally important.  So here it is.

12pm  Took a crumb from the bag of 2CE to make sure there werent any lab mix-ups.
/n
/n
2pm  Still at baseline so I take 5.2mg.
/n
/n
3:30pm-8:30pm  This is the duration for what was a very light peak.

The overall effects at this dose for me were: 
/n
- Surfaces have a soft glow.
/n
- There were light waving hallucinations are only noticed when I stare at the floor for longer than 20 seconds.
/n
- My energy was increased and transformed into a giddy, nervous tone that was fully manageable.
/n
- My thoughts are a bit jumbled but I was still able to take business calls as well as talk to my mother on the phone.

Conclusion: Although not a dose I would repeat again, it worked as a friendly introduction to what I expect to be a challenging ally.  It was a light enough effect that I would consider doubling the dose for the next trail.</bodytext></report>
