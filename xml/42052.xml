This is a basic summary of my limited experiences with meth.

For a long time my experience with drugs was limited to weed and alcohol, several occasions with salvia, and very rare DXM trips. i have a friend who does meth relatively often and had been interested in giving it a try. the first time i tried it the group consisted of me, my friend (who I'll call B) and another good friend, (D). D had also never tried it before.

We smoked two blunts in a large, abandoned field, and then afterwards B made a little tinfoil bowl and put the meth in it. He heated it up and we all took hits from a straw.

I remember feeling very revved up and talkative. We all started spilling out conversation at once, commenting on the things around us and talking about a lot of different topics. I felt very energetic and 'enabled', like I was ready for anything. The feeling went away after awhile and grew less strong. I had no trouble sleeping that night or anything like that.

Over the next few months I did meth several more times. I still wasn't sure if I really liked it or not. A very positive experience I had was with a large group of people about a month or so after my first time. D, B, and I rode down to this guy J's house, where a lot of people were chilling out in his back room. I knew almost all of them and was friends with a few. Like before, we smoked some weed, this time three blunts. While the blunts were being smoked there was also a shit pipe being passed around. The taste was really unpleasant and 'chemical' feeling and irritated my mouth. Besides this, I was having fun with the meth and all the people around me. The bud seemed to counteract with the speed in some strange way, and I really enjoyed the combination. After chilling and talking for an hour so we left. B went home and D and I to this large garden on a college campus in our town.

At the garden we talked for several hours about a hundred different things. It was a really enjoyable and interesting conversation. When it felt like time to leave we rode up to a place near my house and smoked another blunt. We parted ways and I went home. That night I coudln't sleep and I could feel the blood pounding in my brain. I felt restless and strung out, and parts of my body ached. This was a really unpleasant comedown and put me off meth for awhile.

Another month passed, and a guy at school who I'm kind of friends with invited me to get spun with him. I did two large lines in the bathroom and felt that same burst of energy I had the first time, only now even stronger and more intense. I became very social and was talking to everyone around me, even people I barely knew. I felt really active and had a great time working out on the fitness equipment in the gym.

I'd made plans to meet D at the end of the day (we don't go to the same schools) and sure enough, she said weed on her. We went to my house and smoked a joint. The meth feeling had started to die down a little, but the weed instantly started it up again. Like before, the feeling was great. D had to leave abruptly and I was left by myself at my house for several hours.

Parts of that trip were a lot of fun. I had a huge feeling of self confidence and I guess you could say self absorbtion. I kept thinking all these great things about myself. Later on that night, I had one of the greatest and most intense orgasms of my life. Buzzing tremors ran through my body for over a minute afterwards.

Other aspects of that trip sucked, really badly. I was invited to basketball game but felt disoriented and stupid when I started coming down. I got this really crappy feeling all over and when I left the game and went back home all I wanted was to go to sleep.

But i was out of luck. I got this throbbing pain in my eye that wouldn't go away. I tried to close my eyes but it was impossible. It started to freak me out really badly and I began thinking 'oh shit, what the fuck is going on with my body? what the fuck is gonna happen to me?'. after awhile the eye throbbing faded away but i still felt depressed and shitty.
/n

For a long time after this I didn't do any speed. I'd decided it wasn't my thing and that the initial great feelings weren't worth the extremely unpleasant after effects.

Then, yesterday, B asked if I wanted to smoke some of a new sack he'd gotten. I was apprehensive but agreed. We chilled out in his garage for several hours and I got a good amount of hits. There was the same nasty chemical taste again, and I never really got used to it. Later on I started to get a great sensation in my hands and arms and legs, like half my body had gone to sleep and was tingling. When we finished our session B and I had a really good, deep conversation. I learned a lot of things about him I'd never known before. We walked around his neighborhood for awhile and then came back. I tried to make myself eat some dinner but I found the meth had totally gotten rid of all my appetite. I had to force myself to eat the pizza and drink the soda.

I went home and went online for a long while, and got a lot of schoolwork down late at night. I'm still up right now, making this report at around 2:20 in the morning. I haven't felt any of the bad phsyical effects I got the last couple times.

Despite these several experiences, I still have mixed feelings about this substance. Some of its effects are really fun. I'm a pretty social guy, but meth makes 10 times more. I've had great conversations on it, and I especially like doing meth with weed. There's something about that combination that is very unique and extremely fun.
/n

On the other side, I've had some pretty fucking crappy times being spun, so bad that for awhile I told myself I would never want to try it again. Another very big negative for speed is its addictive quality. I know a lot of people where their whole life has been eaten up by it. Some of the things i've read about its effects on the brain have also discouraged me. 
/n

Another aspect of meth that bothers me a lot sometimes is its artificial feeling, both the substance itself and in some ways, the high. I enjoy more .. 'natural' highs, like weed, salvia, and mushrooms.
/n

so, all in all, I guess my basic feeling is this: meth can be pretty fun sometimes, but I want to continue doing it very infrequently like I have been. I've only done it six times in my life, over a period of about 5 months. I'm gonna stick with my favorites, weed and mushrooms, and give meth a try on very rare occasions.</bodytext></report>
