A close friend of mine is getting ready to leave for a 6 month trip to Bolivia. This being his last weekend here, we decided to throw a party for 
/n
him. He and another friend had both expressed some interest in trying 
/n
methylone after I had discussed it with them, and this seemed like the 
/n
perfect opportunity. Although I'd done it the past weekend, I decided to 
/n
join them, so I measured out three doses of 150mg each and brought them to 
/n
the party. I had considered bringing higher doses, but I figured it would 
/n
be better to start them low and see how they respond. The setting of the 
/n
party was at a friends house, with at most 20 people present, a DJ playing 
/n
music, party decorations, snacks, etc. A typical social gathering. 
/n
/n
At around 9 PM, I told my two friends that I'd brought the 
/n
methylone and asked if they were still interested. They mentioned some 
/n
mixed feelings, worried that this would be another 'shitty internet drug' 
/n
that would leave them feeling poisoned (as some tryptamines and 2C-T-7 
/n
had), but they decided to give it a shot after I reassured them this 
/n
wasn't another pukefest trip. We all dosed together at around 9:15. The 
/n
first friend is a male, age 22. I don't know his weight, but he's kind of 
/n
large. The second friend is female, also 22, weighing probably around 110 
/n
pounds. Both are very experienced psychedelics users, having used LSD, 
/n
psilocybin, MDMA, mescaline, DPT, 5-MeO-DMT, DMT (ayahuasca), 5-MeO-DIPT, 
/n
2C-T-7, and perhaps a few others. While both like psychedelics in general, 
/n
the nausea of ayahuasca and 2C-T-7 and the hideous experience of snorting 
/n
DPT has left them somewhat skeptical about many of the currently available 
/n
analogues. I can certainly understand this position. 
/n
/n
At around 9:45, we all began to feel initial effects. The girl said 'I 
/n
feel good 'several times, sounding almost surprised. The guy said it felt 
/n
like the initial phase of a psychedelic. By 10 PM, we were all more or 
/n
less at peak effects. They both described the effects as being similar to 
/n
the initial phase of MDMA, but toned down and subtly different. We went 
/n
for a short walk outside under the full Purim moon, which was brightly 
/n
illuminating the large yard. It was pretty cold, but this didn't seem to 
/n
bother anyone.  
/n
/n
Socializing was definately enhanced, but there was none of the 
/n
emotional outpouring of MDMA. It was a nice friendly evening. All of us 
/n
felt that it was a very relaxed and happy state of mind. By around 11:30, 
/n
we were all coming down. Smoking some cannabis seemed to diminish most of 
/n
the remaining effects, though it seemed to enhance some aspects. By 12:30 
/n
AM, the guy was feeling a little tired and decided to go home. I stayed 
/n
until around 2 AM before I felt comfortable driving home. 
/n
/n
Both my friends expressed a willingness to do it again, but at a 
/n
higher dose. 
/n
/n
Personally, I found no noticable difference between this 150mg 
/n
experience and the 120mg experience of the past weekend (less than a week 
/n
elapsed - Sunday afternoon to Friday night). I wonder if tolerance played 
/n
a role? Probably. Were it not for the fact that my friend was going to 
/n
Bolivia, I would not have taken it again so soon. I think taking this drug 
/n
more than once a month would be a waste... not to mention an unnecessary 
/n
risk, considering the highly experimental nature of this chemical. Taking 
/n
this drug in a social setting was much more rewarding than taking it by 
/n
myself - the exact opposite of MDMA. I would like to try it in a situation 
/n
such as a nature hike with 2 or 3 friends... I suspect that would be the 
/n
optimal use for this material.</bodytext></report>
