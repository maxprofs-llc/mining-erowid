I have always enjoyed kava as a dream enhancer and as a relaxing substance. The effects that I get from kava are always very mild though, so I decided to do an experiment. About 4 hours before this experiment I had smoked some pot, but I was no longer high when I swallowed the capsules. At about 9:00 at night I downed 60 kava pills, a total of 4,500 mg of kavalactones. I started watching some TV and after about half an hour I got very tired. I shut off the TV and drift off to sleep.

At 2:00 in the morning, I am woken up. I am sweating and my vision is completely blurred. I realize that I am going to have to throw up, so I jump out of bed, but am not able to support my own weight. I collapse on the floor, the whole room spinning around me. I fratically crawl to the bathroom and throw up for 2 hours straight. During each break from puking, I curl up in fetal position next to the toilet and watch the whole room spin faster and faster until I have to throw up again. At about 5:30 I feel like I have nothing left in me, so I crawl back to bed (I still am not able to walk).

I sleep for several hours, and then am woken up again by a terrible stomache ache and head ache. I stumble out of bed. I notice that my vision is still blurred, like underwater vision. I am unable to communicate with my mom, my words are slurred and I constantly forget where I am. It is not until 30 hours after eating the pills that I gain back sobriety. The hangover was worse than alcohol and I remember rolling around on the floor tearing and swearing from the pain.

As someone with a high drug tolerance, and with minimal effects from kava pills in the past, I was still knocked right in to place by this substance.</bodytext></report>
