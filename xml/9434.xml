Dont waste your time.  I had been prescribed Meclizine for a vestibular disorder, but the vestibular symptoms went away long before my medicine ran out.  When I read that it was called 'Dramamine II' and was supposed to have the same effect, I thought perhaps I could use it instead of Dramamine to trip.  After 16 pills - 25 mg each - nothing happened.  I just felt a little light-headed, nothing even close to a 'trip'.  If you have some laying around the house, just save it for any time when you're feeling vertigo or general dizziness - it's great for that.  But for tripping?  Forget it.</bodytext></report>
