I started off with 16 mg. My boyfriend (R) had taken 16mg with a very intense trip, and considering I usually have harder trips than others I decided to split the dose with him, each of us taking 8 mgs. We took it at night, which may have been the first mistake, as I soon learned what a wonderful thing the sun is. The come up started when we were in the basement. Everything started moving, everything.

We then proceeded over to his dorm. The lights shot off beautiful fragments, and I could hear every step in the grass clearly. When we got there we decided making out was the appropriate move. However 2c-p links the body and mind on very psychological levels. I believed that he was grape juice and I a cup and that he was pouring into me. I then thought my skin was the night sky and that I was covered in stars. Then that I was Cleopatra and could travel to Africa (located on my hip) by simply turning around. I felt very connected to women in history. All the while rings of electricity were singing up my body, and I had to pause to breathe.

I think the trip would have gone better, except that his roommate and roommates girlfriend were both asleep in the room, their presence making me uncomfortable. Knowing that R had had a difficult trip before with this drug, I started to worry about him. It seemed like he kept leaving the room, but I'm still foggy on that. I do remember suddenly being stricken with fear because I didn't believe it was R that was kissing me. I worried because it seemed that like I could be anyone so could he and that the person I had known had left leaving an animalistic man in his wake. When I looked into his eyes, it was as if he was a different person or not a person at all.

A tad later I ended up alone on the bed, and because it is lofted thought the ceiling was coming done on me. I got down close to the mattress, terrified of the ceiling. R came back, but because I was still unsure it was him I didn't really trust him that the ceiling wasn't getting closer. According to him I sat there in silence for some time. Apparently I slept.

The next day (a few hours later) I was very cautious. I looked out the window for some time captivated by the math and beauty involved with the natural world. I talked very little to the guys, because while they played video games it was as if they spoke in square language while I spoke in circle language. I toyed with the idea of becoming nihilistic, and stood outside in the rain and wind with a black umbrella, and that seemed to bring back my senses, though some things still trigger those intense feelings, such as the shirt R was wearing, other 2cs, and the basement walls.</bodytext></report>
