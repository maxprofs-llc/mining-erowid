Hmm..Weeell, I've been on clozapine [Leponex(r)] for 10 months in and out. Sometimes skipping the drug for days (which induces a period of no sleep). At first, the very first day I took it, it was like the storm in my mind had calmed. But that was it. From then on it produced nothing but a vertigo when gettin' up.

I was about to leave the whole medicine but then I became more aware of other pill poppers and realized that I'm in a blessed position of having able to be drugged all day. I also think that I now get a little euphoria every now and then.</bodytext></report>
