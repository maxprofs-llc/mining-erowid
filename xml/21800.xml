I just want to warn people about a possible interaction between prescription migraine drugs and mushrooms (acid, mescaline, etc).

I was on Verapamil (calcium channel blocker) for migraines, which causes weird things to happen to my blood pressure and the electrical pontentials in the brain. I also ate about a half an ounce of dried P. cubensis mushrooms. The Verapamil blocked the perceptual effects of the 'shrooms so that I did not hardly get any visuals or any 'trippy' effects. What I did get was 3 hours of the worst psychosis I've ever heard of. Granted, eating that many mushrooms might not have been the best idea, but I REALLY wish I had considered the Verapamil.</bodytext></report>
