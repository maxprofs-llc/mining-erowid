I had tried coke a few times but one night a few friends of mine and I decided to all buy a gram or two for ourselves and enjoy ourselves. I had the best time ever with my friends we talked about everything possible...

Later when I went home I felt so shitty... Depressed tired sleepless... I decided to smoke some gravity bongs and after about 3 hits I started sweating and shaking like crazy. I laid in my bed thinking I was going to have a heart attack... I couldnt control my legs they wouldnt stop shaking, I was sweating then freezing and freaking out... Even my dog was sitting by my side crying and licking my face... I stayed up pretty much the whole night lying in bed praying for my life. After that experience I seriously thought I was going to die. I swore to myself I would never do it again. About a week ago I did it again and didnt do as much and didnt smoke. This helped me alot I was fine that time but the time before that scared the shit out of me. Be careful</bodytext></report>
