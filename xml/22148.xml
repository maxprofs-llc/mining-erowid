My teen years were a turbulent time. Race riots on campus and the Vietnam war on TV. The future seemed uncertain. I was intelligent and athletic, but I wasn't a tough kid.  I had known physical and emotional abuse.

My only substance abuse experience had been alcohol, prior to a December night in 1971.  Hanging out with an older brother and several of his friends, I took a half dozen hits on a couple of joints that were going around.  I was 16 years of age.

10 minutes in, I felt a pang of anxiety. My heart began to race. I felt hot and flushed.  My mouth was dry.  When I spoke, my voice seemed distant and detached.  The left side of my head grew cold and numb.  My limbs were not reporting in regularly.

I had to move them to reassure myself that they were still connected.  I decided to take a walk to calm down.  
/n

Then the visual 'convulsions' began.  I would feel an increasing tension in my head, then receive a seizure like shock. When this happened, my visual perspective changed radically. Things would 'zoom' away, as if I were looking through the wrong end of a pair of binoculars.  The frequency of 'siezures' increased to every 4 seconds or so, at the height of my intoxication.
/n
/n
I was overwhelmed with anxiety, fear and dread.  I could not be calmed or reasoned with.  I arrived at the local hospital ER within the hour.  My visual symptoms were beginning to subside.  I was diagnosed as hyperventilating.
/n
/n
At home my mind could not disengage from the experience. I had residual symptoms of numbness on the left back of my head, visual disturbances, anxiety, and head tremor.  I could not sleep, and my thoughts began to race.  Finally, my mind sort of 'melted down'.
/n
I could not eat, or sleep, had no libido, and had feelings of guilt, shame, and overwhelming hopelessness.
/n
/n
Over time, my symptoms lessened and changed to include recurrent migraine with aura, panic attacks, and major depression.
/n
/n
I received no treatment or diagnosis for 20 years, despite several attempts. However, if psychotic illness is part genetic, part environmental, then cannabis has satisfied the environmental requirements for me.
/n
/n
None of the others who smoked the same dope had any negative consequences.  Thinking that I might be able to over-write my bad experience and relieve my anxieties, I attempted cannabis several more times over the next 5 years.  At least once, the visual convulsions returned, and always the psychotic fear.  These events were not followed by a major depressive episode. (guilt/shame/racing thoughts/hopelessness).
/n
Psychoactive substance abuse has to be the rudest way of finding out that I am destined to be mentally ill.</bodytext></report>
