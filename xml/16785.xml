I recently attended a Rave in Oregon where I experimented with 5-MeO-DiPT for the first time.
/n

I had decided to 'try out' the drug at about 1:00p on Saturday before the second night of the Rave got into full swing. I made some inquiries and acquire four doses of Foxy in gelcaps that held about 7-8 milligrams a piece from someone who had a history of supplying unadulterated substances in the past.
/n
/n
I took my first dose at about 1:30p and waited about thirty to forty minutes before I began to feel any effects. They came on quite quickly after my first sensation and grew in intensity rapidly. The overwhelming feeling was that of a strong body high, similar to that induced by psychedelic mushrooms but 'dirtier' by comparison. Some mild nausea also bothered me for another thirty minutes after onset.  
/n
/n
T+1:10 
/n
I decided to take my second dose. 
/n
/n
T+1:20 to T+1:40
/n
While waiting for my second capsule to kick in I quickly realized that I may have made my decision to imbibe a second a bit hastily as the body high grew in intensity. It further increased when my second dose kicked in around T+1:45 or so. 
/n

Throughout this experience the body high was accompanied by an overwhelming feeling of uneasiness and the 'dirty' quality of the sensation also magnified. Unlike MDMA, the sensation felt very unnatural, very chemical in origin, as if I was wearing a skin of 'intoxication.' An overwhelming desire to peel off my skin accompanied this high and began to feel agitated as a result. 
/n
/n
T+2:15 
/n
I started to notice some mild visual effects (tracers, blurring and shaking). I also noticed that I was feeling somewhat aroused and my sense of touch was greatly enhanced. Small amounts of pain became extremely satisfying and relaxing to me.
/n
/n
T+2:30 to T+4:00 
/n
I found myself on a plateau, with a sense of 'coming down' occurring at about T+4:15 to T+5:00. Once disturbing quality of this drug seemed to be the way I came down since I would intermittently feel completely sober and then completely drugged, with no periods of mixed sensation. 
/n
/n
T+6:30
/n
The periods of sensation continued to decrease until about this period, when I decided to ingest a small quantity (about half of 1/8) of psychedelic mushrooms. I began to feel the onset of the mushrooms very quickly. 
/n
/n
T+6:55 
/n
I began to feel the effects of the mushrooms and noticed increased visuals. 
/n
/n
T+7:10 
/n
I took my third hit of 5-MeO-DiPT and waited for it to quick in as the mushrooms maintained a comfortably soft body high. One interesting thing I noticed was that the mushrooms (combined with a hit or two of cannabis) seemed to snap me back into the sensations I felt on just Foxy earlier in the day. 
/n
/n
I estimate it was about T+7:35 
/n
My third dose of the Foxy kicked in (I had not eaten for almost eight hours at this point) and I found the sensations even more intense. While I still felt somewhat agitated and my sense of touch was still greatly enhanced I found that the nausea was almost completely gone. The 'dirty' body high was also noticeably absent and I theorize that the mushrooms helped alleviate some of my previous discomfort.
/n
/n
The rest of the evening continued uneventfully with my plateau beginning at around T+8:15 and continuing for sometime until I imbibed my fourth (and final) dose of the Foxy at around T+10:00. Nothing changed until around T+10:30 when my fourth hit kicked in and I began to notice the 'dirty' body high again, though it was much gentler this time. 
/n
/n
I estimate that the mushrooms began to exit my system at around T+11:10 as it was about this time the 'dirty' body high resumed it's earlier full-blown intensity. I was able to deal with better this time as I was more accustomed to it and as it came on much slower I was able to adjust to it far better.
/n
/n
I was settling in for reasonably good evening when at T+11:35 or so I began to experience very strong visuals and hallucinations. For the next several hours I found it difficult to speak coherently or walk in a specific direction. I often found myself engaging in activities for several minutes before suddenly finding myself back where I had begun and in the exact same moment.
/n
/n
It was enjoyable for a few hours but at about 4:00am (T+15:00) I began to feel very unsettled as the experience was in no way diminishing. I also began to experience uncontrollable muscle contractions in my face, abdomen and thighs. This contractions 'flickered' all over my body and made it incredibly difficult to do anything comfortably, or to relax for any period of time. Coupled with even stronger 'out of body' tripping I was beginning to panic as I could not shut the experience out and I found myself desperate for some sort of nervous system depressant to let me sleep. 
/n
/n
Finally at T+17:00 (6:00am) the hallucinations stopped and the entire high left me abruptly. So abruptly in fact that I found myself shaking from the sudden shift, although I was ecstatic at my experience finally having ended. I was still unable to sleep for another two hours or so but once I finally managed to shut my eyes and lose consciousness I found myself mostly recovered upon waking a few hours later though I did experience a few momentary hallucinations and body twitches throughout the remainder of the day.</bodytext></report>
