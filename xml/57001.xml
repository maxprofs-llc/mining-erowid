This is my first experience of Belladonna. I am still relatively sane so am typing this as I am tripping. Started tripping last night. Me and a friend of mine found a Belladonna plant and took some home with us for me to try. My friend has done a lot of Datura/Brugmansia while I had never tried anything more than mushrooms and cactus.

I'm not entirely sure how much we took so I am estimating in saying we both took about 1 teaspoon worth of flowers, then I left to go to a metal gig in town.

While at the gig I had 2 bottles of Jim Beam and coke and we then went outside to have a pipe of weed.

Well not long after having the weed too the trip started to come on.  I was at the back of the audience with another 1 of my friends when I started hearing people talking behind me and I would see heaps of people all standing there talking. The only person behind me was my friend and she was too busy headbanging to be talking.  I started to feel very claustraphobic so I went outside to sit in the carpark.  By this time my heart was beating furiously and I wasn't sure if I was going to pass out or throw up.  The trees across the road were swaying then jumped up and down and went all over the place.

Eventually we decided to head home, the trip seemed to abate a bit while I was walking apart from the odd minor hallucination, but when we got home I opened the front door and a grey and white cat ran out of the house and onto the footpath then vanished.  When I got inside I went to pick up a plate of catfood off the floor(I don't even have a cat).  I went to sleep pretty much as soon as I sat down.

Still feeling the effects slightly from last night, I decided to have another trip tonight so my friend boiled the leaves and made a tea for me to take.  I took that but didn't feel any effect so we boiled the stalks and I took that too.  That was about 2 hours ago.  We then had some weed.  I'm feeling pretty good now, the effects are nothing too spectacular.  I have had no memory loss or such like.  I am still able to type this, though at times that does prove difficult as I keep seeing things that distract my attention and I find it difficult to tell the keys on the keyboard apart.

I do not feel dillusional.  I am still able to realise what I am imagining and what is real.  But the hallucinations are really quite fun.  The ornaments and posters move.  I have a wizard on the shelf that waves to me every now and then and a grim reaper moddle on top of the computer that whenever I look away (at the keyboard) he flies around the room.  But when I look at it, it lands back on the computer again.  lol.  I keep hearing noises and seeing things move out of the corner of my eyes.

All in all it has been a pretty good trip and I have many hours left of it although I am feeling rather sleepy.</bodytext></report>
