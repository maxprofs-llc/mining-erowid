I was going to visit my girlfriend in the city that day, after having slept a mere three hours the previous night. I'm the type who can't funciton without a decent night's sleep. I had a bottle of yohimbe capsules that I'd yet to sample, so I figured it was worth a try. I'd read its effects described as amphetamine-like, though I figured this was an exaggeration. So I swallowed one with a rockstar energy drink, on an empty stomach.

I was waiting for the effects to kick in when the post carrier came, bearing my half-pound of vanuatu-strain kava, reputed to be very potent. I was starting to feel pretty energised, so I decided I was okay to try some. I was taking the train rather than driving, so if I did get drowsy it wouldn't be a big problem. I added enough water to the 2 tbsp kava to make a paste of sorts, then divided it into little balls. Over the course of about twenty minutes I swallowed them with gatorade. I simply can't stomach kava drinks.

By the time I got to the T station the effects had kicked in pretty well. I felt perfectly awake, as if I had slept a good nine hours, and even had the 'enthusiasm' reminiscent of perhaps 10mg Adderall and a NoDoz. However, I felt none of the jitteriness or anxiety often reported with yohimbe, and I actually felt extremely relaxed, yet still alert. I happily read on the hour-long train ride, and was in a very good mood all day with my girlfriend. I didn't notice any of the aphrodisiac effects associated with yohimbe, but it didn't induce any of the erectile dysfunction caused by most stimulants. We went to be at about one and I had no trouble falling asleep. It also didn't do anything to my appetite.

This was a very enjoyable combination that was quite effective at keeping me awake and in a good mood all day. I want to try combining kava with Ritalin (I have an Rx, but was out at the time of this experience), just because yohimbe's risks kind of scare me, but I'd be willing to try it again in a pinch. Good times.</bodytext></report>
