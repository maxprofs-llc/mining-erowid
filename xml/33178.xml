I first of all tried Kava in a coconut cup in Vanuatu when visiting there when I was about 10.  I only had a few sips and only noticed it made my lips go kind of numb.  Anyway I live in Adelaide, South Australia now where Kava is legal.  There is in fact a place called the Kava Hut 5 minutes drive, right in the city!! It's a bar where there is sand, bob marley music, 70s couches, bongo drums and Kava being served.

My friends had been here many times and I had tried a cup or so of kava bought from this place and it was awful and I didn't feel any effects.  The kava there came in several strengths Regular ($2 for members), Super $5 for members, Mega $8, and Ultra which is about $10.  I decided to begin and literally skulled the putrid stuff in about 6 - 10 minutes.  It is the worst tasting or smelling liquid you can ever imagine.  Worse than drinking stagnant muddy water with gravel in it.  I had an ultra, two supers and two regulars.

I waited another 5 minutes, then another 5 minutes and nothing happened.  I decided to go meet my friends at the pub across the road when it all kicked in.  WOOOOOWWW!!!  An extremely pleasant feeling, exactly like being stoned from Marijuana but without ANY paranoia or depressing effects at all.  I was stunned at how good it was.  The only bad thing was my stomach felt like I was paroletic.  It was like I needed to spew up 100 times and when I went to the toilet and tried to do it I couldn't.

When I got home I tipped over and went straight to bed, possibly with my clothes still on without even brushing my teeth.  I felt like a zombie and my stomach was still churning like the worst stomach ache you could EVER have, and could not throw up.  Next morning the kava had worn off but I still had the stomach churning then at about noon I finally ralphed the kava up and all the stomach churning pain had gone.

Conclusion: since that experience I haven't really been able to drink more than 2 cups of kava without quickly spewing it up again.  I think it may do something to your stomach after your first proper kava experience.  I'm still keen to try it again but this time eat more food so maybe my stomach will handle it better.  I have to get kaved again, the effects were so nice!!!!!  I'm going to try smoking it too as I hear that gives you trashed without having to endure the horrible horrible taste of it. I'd also like to see if Kava capsules are legal or available in Australia too.</bodytext></report>
