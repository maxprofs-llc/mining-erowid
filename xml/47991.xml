I first began to experiment with the non-opiate analgesic Tramadol when I happened upon a very large bottle of it during the summer of 2004.  When I first tried it I tried dosages of 100-150 mg and was quite satisfied with the result, relaxation, euphoria, itchiness, feelings typically associated with any opiate.  I began taking a dosage this size about once a week.  I really enjoyed the effects of the drug until the next morning.  When I would wake up on tramadol I would feel absolutely horrible; I would be somewhat dazed for several hours and nausea was always present as well, in fact I occasionally vomitted.  I got sick of this after a month or so and decided to stop using this stuff.  A

A few months later I decided to try it again and began using it at the same rate I had before.  A few months after this I found that if I were to take it on successive days the hangover effects would lessen each day.  Because I loathed these effects so I began to take the pills for up to 5 days in a row with the first dose usually beginning at 100 mg and ending on the fifth dose at 200-250 mg each evening.  I would then typically take 2 or 3 days off to lessen tolerance.  I did this for a few months until the breaks began to come less frequently, every 2 to 3 weeks I would take a few days off and then begin again for a few more weeks.

By the time I had been doing this for a few months I finally just stop taking any breaks and took the pills every night at dosages ranging from 150-350 mg.  It certainly began to have an effect on my life.  While the hangover effects I speak of typically weren't very noticeable after a few days of dosing, I would still feel very groggy the next morning and would simply not get out of bed for several hours after I was supposed to.  I would frequently miss morning classes just because I couldn't convince myself to get up.

The only reason it did not cause me more problems is that as I built a tolerance I became completely able to function normally while intoxicated.  I finally got tired of it and this morning I took the remaining pills in the bottle and flushed them down the toilet.  While I was never physically addicted to this substance I can certainly say that I was mentally addicted.  Though the effects of this drug were very enjoyable, they didn't outweigh the problems it could cause.  I don't see myself using this substance ever again mainly because I have no access to it, I hope that I never have access to anything like this again.</bodytext></report>
