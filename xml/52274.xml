I have always been into drugs of all sorts.  For the last year and a half or so I have been using oxycontin quite heavily on a daily basis.  I started off with about 20mg doses and currently have been doing 80-240mg, depending on my funds and availability.  I have tried quitting a few times with little success (11 days clean is my record).  I get pretty ill after about 18 hours without a dose.

About two months ago I sprained my ankle pretty bad at work and having an oxycontin abuse treatment referral on my medical history I was not able to get a script for anything but Motrin or naproxen.  After two days in pretty severe pain my doctor gave in and gave me a script for sixty 50mg tramadol tablets.  This was just in time because a I could not find any oxy's for the last day and a half.  I got my script and immediately popped 4 pills (200mg).

After about 10 minutes I popped another 3 (150mg), just from being dope sick and impatient.  Within about 25 minutes the damndest thing happened, I felt great.  There was no high or euphoria but my aches and pains were gone, the sweats had subsided and my energy was coming back.  I couldn't believe how great these were for opiate withdrawal.  I never got any sort of high from these things.

For two weeks now I have been oxy clean and have tramadol to thank.  I'm not too worried about kicking tramadol because it is so much weaker and easier to ween off of.

Warning-I do take an SSRI and at higher doses (600mg+), I have gotten light headed and sort of flush, almost like taking poppers.</bodytext></report>
