So i am relatively new in the world of rec drugs. I have been a pretty regular weed smoker but just recently i started ecstasy (which i loved and will do again soon) and then i tried 2C-E.

I had been looking forward to the night all week, we were gonna score some E and i couldnt wait. we sat around at the local burger joint for hours. we were all a bit pissed off.  we contemplated just smoking the weed that we had with us, but we just really wanted to hold out for the e. Finally we couldnt take it anymore and neither could the guy that was hookin us up.  Fortunately he told us that his friend had something else we might like. It wasnt gonna be ecstasy but we would be satisfied.

We followed him to his house where he sold us the 2C-E. I had never really heard of it but the experiences they told me of definitely made me curious. We bought the stuff and me and one of my friends went back to his house. There we immediately threw back the pill and waited. nothing happened for a long time.

After about 2 hours i only felt a slight body high, i was quite disappointed. By this time a third friend of mine had come over and joined us (he had weed) we decided that we should smoke since this stuff was somewhat lacking.  we walked down the street at midnight and i started to feel a bit creeped out. I could have sworn that there was a person standing in the road but it turned out to be a deer. Well we finally made our way to a house that was under construction and it had a porta-pottie out front.  We decided to smoke in there.

We roasted a few bowls and i could start to feel the comfortableness of being high. after three bowls we decided to leave and find our friends. after i got out i didnt quite feel it yet but it was coming. My friend wanted to keep smoking so he and another guy went into the out-house. meanwhile i stood outside with my other buddy. Before I knew it I was rolling hard. I began to look around and I forgot where I was. Life only happened in two second bursts then I forgot again and became slightly frightned. I turned to my friend and tried to tell him of what was happening to me.  He just told me to calm down, but how could I calm down, hell I wasnt even me at this point I was a whole nother being.

I kept trying to focus on reality but it was difficult my vision was not too great, plus it was very dark.  I felt like I was controlling a video game or a dream and at any time I could pause or turn it off and my body would give up and go limp and fall to the ground.

Finally they were done smoking and we could go back to the house.  On the walk I again tried to explain to the others how I felt but it was undescribable by words.  I just tried desperately to get ready to be dead quiet when going into the house.  We made it to the house and I made it to my friends room alright.  There I continued to wonder what the hell had happened to me. I could only remember for about a half second so when I wanted to say something I would try but by the third word I forgot what I was even talking about.

I desperately wanted people to understand how i felt so I grabbed a notebook and wrote down every thought that came to my head.  I could barely remember what I was trying to write, but I just kept writing. Later I learned, after talking to my friends, that I looked like a psychopath writng endlessly into this book.  After experimenting with other visuals including a strobe light I started to not care about finding cool things to do. I guess I wanted out.

I kept going with it and after six hours of just sitting in my deliriousness I finally went to sleep.  I woke up three hourse later still feeling the effects of the drug.  But I had made it.

I dont regret my decision to try this drug, though I doubt I will ever do it again.  I had loved the amazing euphoria that came with ecstasy, but this was so much different. With this drug I had no control anymore because i wasnt myself. I had a strange outlook while on it and there was nothing I could do to help it.  All I really have to say about how this drug takes affect is that , as a friend told me, it creeps up on you, and after it does: see YOU in a few hours'.

This drug was a necessary experiment in my experiences that will definitely continue. This weekend I plan on doing ecstasy again which I cant wait for.  I also plan on doing acid sometime in the future hope its all that its made out to be and more!</bodytext></report>
