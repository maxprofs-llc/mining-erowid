I walked into my doctors office, with my hopes high. I was on a mission to get these rare blue and white pills. I told my doctor about my anxiety disorder, OCD and various other things. I told him about how I smoke pot and all my symptoms just disappear. He gave me a little slip of paper saying 'Cesamet 1mg'.

I take two of these every day. I do not get really high off of 2 mg but I can say that my anxiety melts away. They produce a body feel and a little bit of visual stimulation. However, Thinking is clearer than ever.

2-4mg with some marijuana smoked is a GREAT combination. It produces an almost mushroom like high. It is simply the greatest pot high.</bodytext></report>
