I have a medical treatment: 0.4 mg X 4= 0.16 mg (near to the classical dose of  2 mg) of Subutex (buprenorphine) per day.

I noticed that Salvia divinorum doesn't work as usual, even with good extracts (X5 from a good store). Just this feeling of salvia gravity, bouncy effects, sweating and nothing else, except being tired.  I noticed the same thing  with codeine...but a little bit less. I wonder if it's because of the gaba &amp; kappa receptors.

So, the first time I took Salvia, I was not on Subutex at all; I smoked just some dried leaves in a water pipe, and I felt  a change in my mind and body. Bouncy effects, laughing a lot, irrationnal thoughts...and sweat!

The second time,it was an extract 5X and I've been a bit scared! I just took a hit in my korean pipe and I lost my body! I was in a very old country house in britanny, and I was near the cheminey. And,I became the cheminey!!! out of body experience. My girl friend, who is a doctor, laughed at me! I could'nt move at all and I was really impressed; But, I was nervous: I told her:'You can't imagine what's happened.....Ha,I lost my body!!!'.

Again,with extract, I tripped really hard: I became an animal! and i realized my dreams were coming true. After, I used normal dried leaves, and it was really intense, but a bit less hard; Sounds and musics were really intense, the furnitures of my appartement were shining....etc...

I have a good experience of  a salvia trip (I made myself an elixir, but it was too strong: nothing happened and suddenly....wow!I was on my bed, thinking I was in a little village in Spain at the dawn! (I was in Paris,hum...).
/n

Since I'm on subutex, it's quite different. The trip doesn't really start....and the few effects are vey short. I want to stop this horrible subutex, if my doctor is okay, and back to my very philosophical diviner's sage!

I stopped Subutex and I noticed S.D was much more active. The only problem with this horrible Subutex, it's quite hard to stop using it. So,I had to get back on it, 'cause I was not very well. Anxiety, panic and bad sleep....

I was only addicted to codeine, so I don't think it's a good way to get out of this stuff with Subutex. I guess, it's a good product for people who are on heroin.

So,if you want to slow down on Subutex, please, do it very, very slowly!</bodytext></report>
