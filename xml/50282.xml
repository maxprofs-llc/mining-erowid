I've been a utilitarian user of ephedrine pills for a good while now, popping one or two over the counter pills at a dosage of about 25mg of ephedrine with 200mg of guaifisin. However, upon hearing about the negative effects of the guaifisin in higher doses, I decided to try extracting the pure ephedrine from the pills to take that instead.

I powdered and heated the pills in distilled water until they were brought to a boil, then removed from the heat and strained them through filters, added more water to the sludge and repeated the processs one more time. The resulting water that was strained off was then dried into powdered ephedrine again. I mixed up the powder in a bit of soda and drank it (god awful by the way, ephedrine is excessively bitter).

It took approximately 15 minutes or so before the effects came on, getting stronger and stronger over the next hour. It wasn't a very intense experience, but rather a very clean, energetic feeling and exceptional focus. All in all, the effects lasted possibly five or six hours, and did an excellent job of making me alert without too much of a speedy intensity to it.

I recommend it as a way to stay awake or enhance a substance such as G or MDMA.</bodytext></report>
