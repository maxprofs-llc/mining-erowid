One day I was quite relaxed but curious about my Rx for fioricet, it was about 2pm on a monday (verry borring). Since I had had no luck with my one vicdin, I decided to take some fioricet since I was calm, alert and verry willing to experament.

T-2:05 I take 10 fioricet and wait for my nirvana. slowly the the effects come like a gentle breeze. I am at home alone for the day, so it is a safe place. As I sit on the couch I feel slow currents of relaxation wash over me this occurs at 2:40.

T-3:22 wonce again I am on the couch in the living room when I begin to feel really intoxicated, but somethings wrong. I begin to feel incredible abdominal pains accompanied by severe nausea. Uh-oh did I take too much tylenol or is it the barbiturate?

T-4:09 I go to the bedroom but the pain is unrelenting I toss and turn for a couple of hours and the pain slowly subsides. later on I am glad just to still have a stomach.
