I had always told myself that I would not touch cocaine. My experiences with most things in life lead me to believe that I have an addictive personality, so I always considered cocaine off limits. This held true until some of my close friends began to use cocaine on a regular basis.

One night I decided to give into my curiosity and try it. That night I must have snorted 5-7 lines of what my friends called 'good cocaine,' and truthfully do not see a point in taking the drug. I felt good for about the first five minutes, by that I mean a little more talkative or energetic. Then the feeling lessened and I started to feel really tired. So I did lines until they did not really affect me anymore. I sat there, unable to sleep but feeling very tired, and wondered to myself why people like this drug so much. Why would I want to risk anything for such a relatively boring high?

In the past I have done drugs such as ecstasy, or mushrooms, among other things. These drugs always produced an experience like nothing sobriety could provide. They were strongly visual or physically enjoyable, and lasted for an extended period of time. I can not say the same for cocaine. I do not believe that I will ever waste my time, or money, on that drug again, especially with it being so costly.</bodytext></report>
