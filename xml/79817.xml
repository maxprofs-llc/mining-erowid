I am a total insomniac and was prescribed to several benzodiazepines. The Halcion did nothing on it's own at the recommended .5 mg dosage so I upped it to 1 mg and still no results. So after weeks of trying it alone I added Xanax to the mix and it helped me sleep very well with no hangover effects due to the short half-life of both drugs. But all in all triazolam is worthless on it's own. However, on several forums I have read about people taking as little as .125 mg with it working wonders for their insomnia, maybe I just have a higher tolerance.</bodytext></report>
