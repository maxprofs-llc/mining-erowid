Part One

Looking for a legal alternative to Cannabis I had read several things on Sceletium Tortuosum (kanna).  I ordered a small amount to give it a try. I was very surprised at the buzz I got from this plant. I took about 4 or five small hits in a one hit pipe...holding the smoke for as long as I could...it had a strange but not unpleasent taste.  It took about 15 minutes to really feel the effects ...a nice mellow pot like buzz but without the time distortion that cannabis gives.  My face felt kind of hot but not like a 'I feel sick hot'...just a strange heat like sensation.  I would really like to smoke the whole amount that I have to see what happens but it's expensive and kind of hard to get....so I'm saving it.

I am already looking for some place to get some live plants and have searched for a couple of days now with no luck....seeds can be had (but they are hard to find as well) but I think I would have better luck with rooted plants. A very pleasent plant indeed... but it's no replacement for pot...like the song says  'there's nothin like the real thing.'

After experimenting with Sceletium tortuosum for a few days in a search for a legal Marijuana alternative to ease my depression. I at first had high hopes I had found what I was looking for.

As I reported in my first submission to this vault 'it was a pretty good buzz after 4 or 5 hits' but now after several days of using it in small amounts (it's hard to put into words)... but ...In my spirit I feel there is something in this plant that is harmful...not sure what it is but I'm not comfortable with it.</bodytext></report>
