I am notorious for not being able to concentrate or able to follow my points in arguments, conversations ect. I also have attention deficit disorder which in my case significantly hinders my ability to concentrate at times. I often find myself rereading passages in books and articles because I lose focus on the content. After going through some serious self questioning times, I realized that if I had a better memory I could better define myself and my values in terms of other people and their values. After reading others' experiences with DMAE I decided it would be a worthwhile investment to purchase some of the stuff.

I bought a bottle of 100 capsules that contain 100 mg of DMAE per capsule for 8 dollars and some odd cents at a local health foods and supplement store. About an hour after purchase I decided to administer the white capsule and see what it does.

When I got home I received a call from my friend who enjoys debating things, I usually cant convince him on most subjects of conversation, But when he called we started up an important debate about the fallacies of one of my ex-friends------ long story short I was able to nail down all areas of this debate to the fullest extent. My memory seemed to be in overdrive, It was like I was in a library of my memories and I had the ability to pinpoint specific ones I needed to back up my points. The speed and efficiency in which I was utilizing my points, language, and logic was something I dont do with such precision. I left my friend thoroughly convinced of how I felt towards this individual and I had shifted my friends perspective as well.

The next day I took another 100mg (one capsule) and went to school, I had followed everything my professors were discussing with awesome focus, I had taken extensive notes and really absorbed the class material. I took DMAE the morning of a test. While I was taking the test I hadnt studied very extensively for, memories of being in class while reviewing material seemed to resurface  this is something that never has really occurred to me before, when I got my test back on it I had received 87 percent on it.  I read an entire 150 page novel yesterday without rereading passages for clarity, I was able to absorb the book.

The effects of DMAE are definitely apparent. For me it seems to temporarily disable Attention deficit disorder, allowing me to focus and concentrate significantly more than usual. I started out on just taking a one capsule at a time and I received all DMAEs rewards. I owe a little credit to DMAE for my self discovery in part with DMAE as well, I can focus on issues while in the midst of thought.</bodytext></report>
