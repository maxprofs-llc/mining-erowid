One time when I was waiting on pot I took two bong hits of tobacco because I had heard they give you a strong buzz. So I packed up a bong hit and smoked. Just as I took my lips off the bong I felt the effects. They lasted about a minute. I felt that the world was spinning. This amused me so I started walking around. My balance was really off and I felt a bit nauseous. Next I packed up a bigger bong hit. After half of it I felt a very strong buzz and the world was spinning around and around and I felt like I was going to puke. I fell to the floor and started crawling to the bathroom. Its a good thing it was next door because I don't think I would have made it very far. I puked for a minute and then sat on the bathroom floor for five minutes. I went out side on the porch after that and after twenty minutes I did not feel bad anymore.

There is no way to describe the sickness I felt. Now whenever I smell tobacco I get a nauseous feeling. At least now I won't smoke cigarettes.</bodytext></report>
