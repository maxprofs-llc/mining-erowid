My experience with datura was accidental but nontheless noteworthy.

My husband pulled a plant from the garden thinking it was Burdock a healthy herb, but instead it was Jimson weed (they do have similar appearance). He pulled up the entire plant and cut it up leaves, roots and all to make a tea. About 30 minutes after he had given me a cup of this tea he said 'i feel like I've had a pint of whiskey.'  I had a mild head rush but nothing too strange. He then got up and staggered to the bathroom then to the bedroom, laid down then got up and promptly fell on the floor. He spent the rest of the night talking to people that were'nt there and I was lucky enough to just have distortion of reality. This lasted about 8 hrs.

The reason for his much stronger 'high' was that he had gotten the juice of this plant on his hands in large part from cutting up the plant.  Please be aware that this plant can affect you strongly just from handling it.  I would'nt recommend this so-called high.</bodytext></report>
