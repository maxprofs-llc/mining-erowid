This is a broadcast from the depths of an unpleasant place.  As i try to keep my eyes from jittering out of my head, and my stomach in it's proper place.....i advise strongly to avoid coricidin C+C as a source for DXM.  If you have to, if you want to, we are all free.....do as you wish.....but look before you leap........keep it clean, keep it pure....do not take ANYTHING with Chlorpheniramine Maleate......if thats how it's spelled......CPM is easier.

Sure, you will still trip, but this is the dirtiest, most unpleasant trip i've had in a long time.......i started using DXM through coricidin, and it wasn't this bad.....but something is seriously wrong........Pure DXM, i shall say, is like Mount Olympus, and Coricidin is like, say.......a steel mill town, all foggy and polluted and rank.

Do not use Coricidin.  It works fine for a cough and cold.....if you're sick, i can suggest no better cold medicine.....but don't pop 'em like skittles cause they have the candy coating.....seeing your stomach contents and seeing the world spinning and not being able to walk is NOT cool, CPM is very, very dangerous, as i have said........do not take coricidin!</bodytext></report>
