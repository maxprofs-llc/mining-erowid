I bought a gram of a resin extract of calea not too long ago. The first night I had the chance to smoke it, I smoked a good sized bowl. I felt some slight headchange effects while I was awake, but nothing too special. I stayed awake for about 30 more minutes and then went to sleep.

I woke up and, NOTHING, actually, maybe something. All I had was a dream about an ex-girlfriend, but it was only 5 seconds and it could have just been a normal dream, nothing too vivid. So I was bummed, but the second night rolled around and I tried again. This time I smoked a bit more thinking that I might have not smoked enough previously. Same effects while I was awake, feels like I took one hit of marijuana or something.

I went to sleep, woke up, and NOTHING AGAIN! I got over it and just started using the rest of what I had to lace bowls of marijuana, cause that indeed made the high better, but I  had no lucid dreaming whatsoever.</bodytext></report>
