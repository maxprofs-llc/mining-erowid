It took me forever to get off the drug , its been 4 yr. since not prescribed to it and I am still addicted... I hate it, and love it at the same time.  Its sad I know.  And I will do anything to get it. It makes me pissed that doctors give this shit away.  If ADD means its hard to concentrate, then I guess everyone has ADD and def. should not be given speed to 'cure' it.

Adderall is fun when it makes you talkative, somewhat nervous, and very compulsive. I used to lock the doors 10 times before going to bed when I was taking Adderall habitually. Also, wash my hands constantly and smoke constantly. I would cry for no reason at times just because every feeling I had was intensified so much.  Although I have been off my prescription for quite some time, i still (sadly) will take it if someone said, 'here, have some adderall'.  Well there is my sad pathetic story.</bodytext></report>
