I noticed that there arent many (if any) HBWR Ghana strain reports so I thought I should add this as it is happening. I bought the seeds from one of the best vendors online for about $5.00/100.  I knew that they were less potent, but very inexpensive, compared to the Hawaiian strain; so I thought I would just up the dose.  Alone, I chewed all of the seeds over a two hour period on a light meal beforehand (30 mins before).  I am in good health, no meds, and in a good frame of mind to trip so fingers crossed (dicks too).

1hr-after 50 seeds not much more than a slight buzz is noticed

2 hr-just finished the last 50, still only a slight buzz and now gas (hoo-raaaa!)

3hr-I believe I have reached peak buzz with slight euphoria, but still no trip

1:00am- no trip, no visuals (open or closed eye), only a mild narcotic like euphoria and slight body high

Conclusion- For $5 I guess Im not too pissed, I mean I did achieve some effects with no discomfort.  Clearly I just need to buy the Hawaiian strain and eat the low seed doses; I believe they are $18/50.  The HBWR India strain is the next potent, supposedly, but still not near the Hawaiian by comparison ($9/50). Dont waste money on inferior strains.  I have read that some people actually puke their hearts out on 6-7 Hawaiian seeds; I ate 100 of the Ghana with little effect.</bodytext></report>
