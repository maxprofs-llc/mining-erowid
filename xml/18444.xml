It is about T=18.00 CET, took about 200mg 99.3% pure BZP in a capsule. From reading about it, I expected to feel something after 30 minutes. But felt nothing. Also, I was on empty stomach.

I had thoughts that the stuff I have is not pure enough or maybe fake. So I decided to smoke a little to feel the effects faster. My expectation was to feel after 2 minutes, but I felt as before this experiment began. The way I smoked, was with foil from a chewinggum packet and a rolled paper roll (the usual way that I smoke yaba). It tasted soapy and then I became convinced that it is BZP. There was a weak taste of burnt plastic too, pherhaps that was from the foil, I was sure that I burnt the plastic off before use, pherhaps there was some left? Also I snorted very little, it did not burnt, but it cleared away some snot. I thought for myself that I've found a best way to clear snot from the nose.

At this point, my eyes were not dilated. But there was something going on in my body. To enhance my feelings, I went to the local store, bought some beer, then drank 4 beers (14 cl alcohol).

I was on party mood, called friends, but nobody could go out with me, they have to work the day after.

I found that BZP is too weak for me, so I made 3 new caps. Took them all at once, then went alone to the city. There was now 1000mg BZP in my body.

Now I started to experince that I'm stoned, I walked on the escalators and felt myself lighter, as the floating when on ecstacy. But that feeling lasted only for few seconds. Anyway, I knew that I was stoned. I ended up in a bar, where I sat alone, found myself looking at people very interesting. In the bar they played only hiphop, and I don't like that kind of music. So I left after 45 minutes. At this point my eyes were fully dilated.

I looked for a disco, but couldn't find any good one. Felt for female company, but not sex. When I spoke to people, they did not understand what I said to them. In my opinion I spoke clearly. When I walked I did it very quickly, sort of like running. Time went slow, and standing in queues were somewhat annoying. Most people ignored me when I asked what time it was etc. I must have had a very stoned look.

I got to a place that played hip hop. While dancing I found out that my heart is beating rapid. I got a anxious, tried to talk with people, they did not understand what I talked about, or they just turned away ignoring me. Later I sat down next to a table with lot of glasses. Then a few guys came, and it was OK for me to sit there. I tried to explain about my pulse to some guy and told him to watch 1 minute for me, instead he bought me a drink. Well.. later I was back on the dancefloor.

The place closed and I went to another one. I tried to write my phone number on a piece of paper, but couldnt see what I wrote. The person I gave my number to had a hard time reading what I wrote. I had a hard time talking and understanding what people spoke to me. Anyway, my pulse was high, but not as high as in the disco.

This third place closes and I walk around in the city. Take the subway home. On the way home I had problems with my pockets, I don't know what pocket is there and I can't examine them. It is also very hard to wrap up the paper from gum.

I'm back home. Couldn't read the newspaper. It is still hard to read, the letters are just a big mess. Tried to read a map, it was too much information for me. Saw myself in the mirror, my pupils were not only dilated, my eyes were really wide open. I think this could have been the reason people avoided me. I had a weird look. I stopped drinking water, didn't feel thirsty. During the night I think I had several liters of water.

My eyes are a little less dilated and are not as wide open as before.

I wake up. My eyes are back to normal. Everything is as it used to be, except that my lips are very dry.

Myself, I prefer ecstacy. I think this could be an alternative to those who find ecstacy too heavy. To be stoned on BZP is closer to meth than ecstacy. On meth I talk more and meth is also heavier. That my eyes were dilated for a such long time was really annoying. If I take this again, I will take 300-500mg. No way more, and if I wouldn't feel anything, I don't care, because I don't want to repeat this eye dilation. And a having a friend watching me is a good idea, what if I would have collapsed on the dancefloor?? And I almost got stopped by police, I saw them staring at me from their car, that would have been an unpleasant experience. I had harder time making contact with people on BZP than on other drugs.</bodytext></report>
