My mom gets OTC pills with codeine in them for her bad headaches.
/n
Each pill contains 300mg of Acetaminophen, 15mg Caffeine and 8mg of codeine. Since this was my first time I decided to take 8 pills which totals:
/n
64mg Codeine
/n
120mg Caffeine
/n
2400mg Acetaminophen
/n
/n
I took the pills followed by a glass of water around 1:30am once everyone had gone to sleep. By 2:00am I was starting to feel it, I got all warm and a little itchy and everything was kind of a dull numb. I could bite my lip pretty hard and barely feel it.
/n
At around 2:30 I peaked and then this is where something went wrong.
/n
/n
My arms started getting jittery, I developed a slight headache, my neck started hurting and my stomach started getting upset. I had to lie down to stop my arms from jittering, and myself from possibly puking. I decided to abandon my computer and go lie down for the night. I felt pretty tired but the caffeine seemed to keep me awake. While laying down every now and then it was like I got hit with a wave of numbness. I managed to drift in and out of sleep and around 4:00am I woke up with the worst stomach pain ever. I wriggled around for about what must of been 20 minutes hoping for the pain to stop.
/n
After it went away I went back to sleep.

/n
Now I dont know exactly what caused this, but I'm thinking the jitters came from the caffiene.

I will try this again, but this time I will use the extraction technique to filter out the acetaminophen as I'm sure that had some sort of adverse effect.</bodytext></report>
