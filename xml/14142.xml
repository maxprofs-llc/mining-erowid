2 days ago, I read a report here on Erowid titled something like '/n' by LiHouLong.  Having 4 oz. of 'premium' wormwood leaves sitting around (that I ordered from a reputable internet supplier for the purposes of making some home-distilled absinthe), I decided that I could spare an ounce for the sake of science.  I pretty much used the same preparation that LiHouLong used in his report but mine was simpler, I think.  Here's what I did:
/n

1.  I blended 1 oz. dry wormwood leaves until totally powdered.
/n
/n
2.  I added just enough reagent-grade ethanol to the powder to cover it completely.  I continued blending the powder and alcohol for about 3 min.
/n
/n
3.  I poured the mushy mess through a cheese cloth (I had to keep adding minute quantities of ethanol to the gunk stuck to the blender in order to get it all out).  After filtering the funky-gunk through the cheese cloth, I folded the cheese cloth a few times (as to create more layers and better filtration) and filtered again.
/n
/n
4.  After this filtering process, I was left with a VERY DARK green and murky liquid.  Even though there were some extremely small plant particles suspended in the liquid, I decided that this was good enough.
/n
/n
5.  I poured the liquid into a flat pan and evaporated the liquid over the period of 2 hours on an electric hot plate in a somewhat well ventilated area.
/n
/n
6.  When the alcohol evaporated, I was left with some nasty-looking stuff!  I tried to use a razor-blade to scrape it up but DAMN--it was too thick!  I used a putty-knife and, believe it or not, it worked great!  I had about two grams of this stuff.  I did my best and rolled the greenish-black 'tar' into 2 equal balls, weighing approximately 1 gram each.

That was last night.

First thing this morning, my curiousity got the best of me so I put one of the 1 gram balls of 'the Thuje' into my handy *heh heh* 'tobacco' pipe and blazed away, surprised at how pleasant and easy to handle the smoke actually was.  After smoking the ENTIRE ball, I said 'screw this' and went about my morning chores, thinking that I had wasted my time.  No buzz, no nothing.
/n
/n
Then about 20 minutes later *BAM*  I was high as hell.  Now, when I say 'high', I don't mean like 'reefer high' or anything like that.  It was totally different and totally cool.  First of all, I felt energized--and believe me--I don't usually feel so energized that early in the morning.  At the time, I didn't think that I was very cognitively impaired/altered but looking back, I think that I must've been because I kept thinking over and over the phrase 'HOLY CRAP'.
/n
/n
I realize that this sounds totally crazy but I think that I was just surprised that the Thuje actually worked. About one hour into the experience, I had to start geting ready for work although I was still seriously messed up.  In fact, I think that I still might have been getting even higher at that point.  I went into my bathroom, filled the sink with water, covered my face with shave gel and proceded to shave as I do on most mornings.  However, as I looked in the mirror, the image staring back at me would look more and more artificial the longer that I stared at it.  It was weird because my reflection seemed to get clearer and clearer with each passing second until it was ULTRA-CLEAR.  The concept is difficult to describe but soon I started laughing and I literally could not stop.  I just kept looking at my reflection and continued laughing and trying to shave at the same time (cutting myself more than once in the process, of course).
/n
/n
The feeling reminded me of the only time that I've ever done salvia d. and that was a small dose (a few bong hits taken in sequence leading to symptoms similar to those described above but very short lived--but if I can remember correctly, the headspace was similar, especially when I was laughing my ass off in the mirror).  Anyway, the effects continued, even after I had gone to work.  Playing it cool at work was no big deal for the most part (except when I thought about looking in the mirror which generated some chuckles that were difficult to hold back at times).
/n
/n
All in all, the experience lasted about 6 hours from approximately 1 gram of the Thuje.  There was no harsh comedown or any after-effects that I could perceive.  Right now, it is close to midnight on the day of this experience and I am totally baseline.  Will I try the Thuje again?  Hell yeah!  I've still got about 1 gram left and can't wait to let a few friends in on this secret.  Then again, smoking the Thuje may be totally dangerous for all I know so try it at your own risk.  Thanks for reading this long report and a BIG thanks goes out to LiHouLong for reporting his experiment!  By the way, VOTE LIBERTARIAN--if you value freedom, that is!</bodytext></report>
