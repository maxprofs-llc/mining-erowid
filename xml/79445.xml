This is the account of my first experience with the psychedelic compound, DOB. Me and a couple friends had purchased 7 hits of what we thought was LSD, 2 of those hits being mine.  The acid came on sugar cubes however I noticed a yellowish tint at the top of some sugar cubes, indicating that I had an RC because LSD is colorless.

The plans for this trip were sketchy at best and in the end, they were completely demolished.

I was grounded.  Grounded for the weekend that I would get a chance to drop some acid.  Prior to this I had done morning glories, shrooms, salvia, and a whole lot of pot.  I decided that I would have to sneak out of my house this weekend because I could not miss this opportunity when acid was so scarce. My plan was to leave a note telling my parents that I needed time to cool off and that I was depressed.  So, I left from my house early Saturday morning and met my friend at his house, well call him C.  We each took one hit at around 11:00am for a walk to another tripping friends house, F.

By the 1 hour mark I was getting excited because I knew I would feel something soon however none of the normal effects were happening except I felt slightly dizzy which could easily have been placebo.  This is when I began to figure out that we had probably ingested a research chemical.  Post-trip research indicated that it was most likely DOB.

When C and I get to Fs house, another fellow tripper arrives, W.  Me and C took our other hit while F took his two and W took his one.  At around 1:00pm I noticed an increase in body temperature and my face was feeling really warm.  It kinda felt good though.  I was becoming kinda slap happy and felt no anxiety whatsoever which is really different from the come up on my first shroom trips.  We all decided that we felt chemical which some of my friends didnt like, but I found it to be quite clear headed.

At 1:30 I got my first signs of visual effects.  My friends garage door began pulsing and expanding ever so slightly but it was definitely noticeable.  I grew very excited and energized at the discovery that it wasnt bunk material after all.

At around 2:00, everything in my plan went to hell.  My parents had found out where I was and came to pick me up.  Id say that the complete trip began once I stepped into their car with a dull but noticeable tingling of fear down my spine.  I got home after an awful argument with my mom and headed straight to the shower to smoke a couple cigs and calm down.  However, I found there to be a very clear mindspace and the trip was pretty easy to control.  The lines on the tiles swayed and when I looked up at the fan, the notches began to grow darker and darker.  I realized just how much my world had changed in the last 30 minutes and it made me chuckle to myself in spite of the situation.  When I got out of the shower, I looked in the mirror and sure enough my face would morph much like it did on shrooms.

My mom thought that I had been smoking weed and I laughed at this because I had been clean for a while due to drug testing.  My dad decided to spare me from my moms anger and we left to go get something to drink and to talk.  So I get in the car with him and the first thing he asks me is if I will fail a drug test.  I told him that I wouldnt fail one but it was obvious that I wasnt sober.  Knowing that my dad isnt as judgmental as my mom, I finally just told him the truththat I had dropped acid.  He told me that he wasnt angry at me but he was kinda disappointed.  We went to a nearby gas station to get some drinks and I picked up a red bull.

When I stepped into the gas station I finally noticed the shift in color as I was in awe staring at the different colored candy bars at the register.  Instantly, my perception of colors intensified greatly because I was so happy.  I just stared at it and began having a little trip laugh as people started staring at me.  I was entranced by the colors and probably looked really zoned from other peoples perspectives.

While driving down the road there were these trees that had purple Christmas lights on them but to me it looked as if the entire tree was purple, the bark and leaves and everything.  It was a little ridiculous looking.

We parked in a semi empty parking lot and me and my dad had a long conversation about everything from friends to sports to drugs.  The parking lot lines were waving back and forth quite intensely.  The head space was clear for the most part and I was really social for tripping however I did notice that there were times when it was hard to concentrate on the conversation because of the visuals.

When I got home my dad gave me a few cigs and told me to walk down to the park while he tries to cool my mom down.  I walked into the wilderness and entered a new realm.  At the top, green was the prevalent color, the middle was a yellowish brown combination of dead leaves and tree bark, and the bottom was the blackish brownish green of small plants, dead leave, and soil. The patterns in the tree bark encircled me and the colors made me smile like an idiot.  I pulled out a cig and noticed that the writing had become extremely bold style.

After finishing the cigs, I returned home.  Walking had a slight floating feeling.  It was mostly enjoyable although I had slight muscle tension in the back of my neck.
/n
I returned home to take a clean drug test and proceeded up to my room for a night of psychedelic tunes and patterns.  My favorites were the stained wood grain on my furniture that flowed like rivers and became bolder and bolder like the writing on the cig. I also noticed shapes, figures, and symbols being made in the carpet if I stared at it.  It was absolutely amazing.

After around 12 hours of tripping, I took some valerian root and slowly drifted off to sleep to awake the next morning refreshed and energized. Low dose DOB was a great time and I enjoyed every second of it even though the setting turned so sour.  Definitely something to do with my friends again in the near future.</bodytext></report>
