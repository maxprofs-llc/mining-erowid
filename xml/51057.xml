I've tried a number of pills for their recreational effects, such as Vicodin, Ultracet, Klonopin, Xanax, and even Benadryl. I got a hold of some Mirtazapine and decided to give it a try.

I ingested one 45mg pill at around 10pm and waited for the effects. I remember going to the bathroom and the room shifted colors to a gold color. This may have been placebo, but I dont know. When the pill kicked in it was very mellow, but too mellow for me. I thought that my breathing was becoming more and more shallow as time progressed. I got a semi-nice buzz from it. The only thing I didnt like was the buzzing in my joints, from there I laid down and drifted off to sleep.</bodytext></report>
