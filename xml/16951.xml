I had come upon some fentanyl that I got from a 5 mg duragesic patch. I used about .625 mg of fentanyl which is roughly the equivelence of 25 mg of heroin which is an average smoked dose so I cut the patch in 8 equal peices. I took one peice and dripped all of the slimy solution onto a full cigarette and put the rest away.   I took the cigarette outside and began to smoke it at first I was a bit tense just because of the potency,  but I ended up just smoking and inhaling the whole thing. About 5 minutes after I got the same opiate feeling as codeine.   It didnt last very long only about 30 minutes and the effects werent as I expected fentanyl would be. I think I didnt get enough but I decided to just throw the rest away because of my young age and inexperience in drugs.

I would describe the feelings as about 250 mg of codeine although no real side effects that codeine gives. I dont want to get to abstract because I beleive people should try drugs for themselves to make there opinion of them, rather than having some lamer describe them to you.</bodytext></report>
