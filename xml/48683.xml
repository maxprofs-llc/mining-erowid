4:00 PM: Friends arrive, start on 40 oz. Budweiser.
/n
6:00 PM: Friends return.  Consume 1/2 of Budweiser 40 ounce malt liquor.
/n
6:30 PM: Friends leave, as I'm finishing last half of Budweiser 40 ounce
/n
7:00 PM: Down first Soma and one Vicodin, and first Loricet chased with Budweiser malt beverage.
/n
7:30 PM: Down second Soma, second Vicodin, second Loricet, chased with Budweiser malt beverage.
/n
8:00 PM: Finish Budweiser malt, down 50 mg Butabital and third Loricet with it.
/n
9:00 PM: Am starting to feel drowsey; not with the alcohol or opiates alone (which I'm used to downing morphine sulphate with 140 proof+ Absinthe anyway), but I experience a sort of 'leaning' sensation; as if I'm actually drunk.
/n
/n
9:30 PM: I decide to call my dealer to ask him for more Barbies...please.  Forget the morphine, the mushrooms...nevermind my stash of 'sinthe and 2-CE; just give me some more Butabital, tonight.  No luck, have to wait until tomorrow.
/n
9:45 PM: I call my dealer AGAIN...please, more Butabital.  No luck, just gotta wait.
/n
/n
10:30 PM: Am losing intoxicated state, crack open a spare bottle of Rinfrescante.  This state is similar to the state induced by MSContin x Absinthe, to an extreme.
/n
11:00 PM: Have finished the first 750 ml of 14.2% red, am cracking the second.
/n
12:30 PM: Have finished the second...effects of the pills have nearly worn off.  Am starting to feel the GI-related side-effects of alcohol and APAP over the alcohol.
/n
1:30 PM: Decide to take a moment to fecate; feces leaves strands of red (more of a burgandy than crimson)...obviously serious GI altercations, but no yellowing of the skin differs from any possibility of serious infection.  Small (~1/4' diameter) scabs are also apparent.
/n
4:30 AM: All effects of alcohol have faded, am simply hungover at this point.  Feces is 'foamy' and somewhat dissatisiying at this point.

It's not recommend to dose APAP over 1 gram (1,000 mg), though, in this particular experience, I consumed nearly (or over) 4 GRAMS (4,000 mg) of APAP.  Normally this would result in an ER visit, complete with charcoal stomach-pumping (useless at this dose) and probably heavy downer injection.

This is extremely harmful to your liver and kidneys, do NOT fool yourself.  Also be aware that ~32.5 mg of codeine, ESPECIALLY in combination with ~5 drinks of alcohol, is severely dangerous and, under any circumstances, is not condoned.

Red wine, while is constructive of the CV (cardio-vascular) system (by removing excess blockage from arterial tissue), is extremely harmful to the GI tissue; I did not mention (simply because it was not correlative to the report) that I've gone through a case of this same wine, as well as 500 cl of 74% Au Blanche' absinthe in the preceeding week.

/n
Psyche view: Would have stayed clean for a week, and only consumed the 'sinthe, Soma's, and barbs...
/n
/n
Rec view: Would have skipped the alccy and just dropped the three Lori's, the Soma's, and the Barbs.

Between the anal bleeding and inability to comprehend simple functions in a work environment the day after, I would probably eat this everyday...</bodytext></report>
