Having taken phentermine several times orally with similar results to coke, I decided to snort it to see what would happen.  I took a 37.5mg pill and crunched it up finely enough to snort.  Dose was taken over about 6 sessions.  Each session acted like a 'cocaine' bump but not as intense.

The first bump was the most dramatic causing burning in each nasal passage and euphoria for about 15 mins.  After that, each hit was pretty much maintenance to keep the buzz going. I have this feeling that I will be  awake for awhile but not necessarily high.  This is what makes phentermine so valuable as a weight loss drug in that it makes me entergetic, not hungry and does not affect my nervous system drastically.</bodytext></report>
