Through the past couple years I've taken E around 60 times, with half of those taking more than one pill. There is always a lot being said about how users felt a depresion the following days after rolling, honestly I can say I've only felt this once, and I truely feel that the 4 pills that I consumed were heavily cut cause I barely felt any of the MDMA effects.

To give a little background on me, through my junior year in high school I had severe social anxiety avoiding people at all costs; I would also have anxiety attacks in school, and have to go home. I had never taken any medicines for this though, for my parents did not believe that it would help.

After the even the first few doses, this anxiety that had ruined my life til that point, had started to disapate. I don't know if I'm a special case, cause I have never heard of this happening to anyone else besides that it was used for therapy before it was made illegal in 1985?. Other than that though, the only post rolling effects Ive ever had was jaw clenching, which happens with most any drug I do. Lately though, when I take E, I have minimal reaction to it. My eyes barely dilate, unlike usually, and no other effects. My friends with also take the same pills and feel the effects, so I know they arent bunk. I guess I just have to walk away from this miracle drug, and thank it.</bodytext></report>
