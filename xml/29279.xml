I previously had no experience with 2C-I or any of the similar phenethylamines. Throughout all of my experiences with 2C-I, I was not on any medications and taking no one drugs besides smoking marijuana.

I first tried this drug nasally, and found the dosing for this method to be a little more than required for smoking, but a lot less than oral dosing. The burn was pretty minimal, and the taste was easily ignored. This way took about 30 minutes or so to feel the effects.

Oral dosing worked out different than I expected. I tried this about 4 times and then stopped using this method, and I don't reccomend it for a few reasons. My friends and I found it hard to tell how much was needed for a person, and went through a few runs without achieving effects. Another reason why I don't reccomend oral dosing is that it produced stomach cramps and head aches in a few people including myself. I found that if I ate a small amount, say 10mg, and then an hour later smoked some it helped. But this was not needed and probably a waste of material. Eating lasted about 8 hours, and would peak at 2.

Smoking this drug turned out to be my favorite method. The way I would smoke it was in a light bulb, and i would vaporize all of the material and get all of the smoke. 2C-I was never too hard on the lungs, but it smells pretty strange. Onset when smoked was almost instant, and would last about an hour. really good.

When I am peaking on this drug, it almost feels a little like the buzz of alcohol. This drug does not cloud my thinking, but it makes thinking an unwanted task. I didn't feel this drug was at all similar to ecstacy, for some reason I heard some one say this before. I have never done 2C-B, but I haven't done anything this drug is very comparable to on its own. This drug feels pretty good and is quite interesting, but I didn't think it was anything that special. Combining this drug with marijuanna increases the effects and makes them extremely noticable, and I found that was always the best way to use it.</bodytext></report>
