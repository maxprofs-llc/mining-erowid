  It occured to me today when my beer brew kit began bubbling, that I could effectively kill two birds with one stone. why not place the beer next to my homegrown fan to utilise the carbon dioxide let off during fermentation, so saving money on a cylender of CO2.

  Also the room is kept at a constant 22.3 degrees C which will be muchly apreciated by the fermenting ale I'm sure.</bodytext></report>
