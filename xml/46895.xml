Kind of fuct. Serious mind fuck and closed eye visuals. Thinking to myself 'I will never be the same again'.

In an hour I was at baseline and could not believe what I had just been through. It was strongly visual in an odd way. The body high was intense. I huge flood of thoughts ran through my mind from negative to positive and everywhere in between. In a weird way I feel enlightened about different areas of my life that I had been trying to keep secret even from myself. I am still having random memories from this but oddly enough they are not unpleasant. BTW the coolest thing about smoking the venom was keeping the toad. 'Merlin' is the shiznit. I have noticed his eyes dilate alot. I think he is tripping off of his own supply. Anyway excuse typos and randomness of this report. I just inhaled another huge hit.</bodytext></report>
