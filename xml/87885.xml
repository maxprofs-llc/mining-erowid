/n
6:00 am - heading off to watch the sunrise
/n
/n
6:00 am to 8:45 am - vivid awesome hallucinations like i have never seen before on any type of enthenogen, +++ on shulgin scale almost got to a ++++ gorgeous Open eye visuals and Closed eye visuals. I was absolutely engulfed in the visuals beautiful hexagonal snowflake like (mandalas?) patterns in the sky rotating slowly clock wise and counter clock wise they were huge and they seemed so real it was amazing... i could have had a ++++ but i chose to not let my mind drift in that direction, i was not prepared to experience what bromodragonfly had in store for me... so i 'drove' the trip back towards home
/n
/n
10:09 am - still tripping heavily
/n
/n
12:08 pm - effects slightly diminished still a ++ on shulgin scale
/n
/n
1:00 am - effects almost completely gone ready to go to sleep! took some melatonin and Valerian root to calm down whatever psychedelic fuzz remained.
/n
/n
4:00 am - finally go to sleep
/n
/n
next day i felt amazing and refreshed and happy to be alive, i feel the experience has definitely softened my ego and showed me the beauty of nature
/n
i felt so much ability to think about ideas and communicate with people while on bdfly.
/n
 it was a mind opening life changing experience... the most powerful i've had to date.</bodytext></report>
