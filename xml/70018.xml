I started with 50 seeds, decided to keep 5 to see if I could grow them as houseplants.

10:00 - I begin by eating 2 seeds. The flavour is strange, the bitterness is too much. I decide to crush the remaining 43 seeds and make tea from it.

11:10 - Finished drinking the tea.

12:00 - A very mild change in awareness.

2:00 - Nothing much is happening so I go to bed.

The next day I vomited when I woke up. Felt weak. Partially incapacitated. Got some gut aches and hot flashes. Around 6:00pm I vomited again after only drinking water all day. It was green.

Gut pains persisted for days.
