So, i've been interested in datura for a while now. I finaly got the seeds on a shaman website and I really researched it a lot. But so I decided one day I would take 5 seeds on an empty stomache. An hour or so later I was feeling wierd. Not seeing anything but I wasnt baseline. So after that went off I just decided I'll try a real dose when I have a sitter. But I just couldnt wait.

One night after my parents went to bed I decided this was the night. I had recently eaten almost a half of a pizza about an hour earlier. So I knew if the seeds worked at all it would be hours before they kicked in. I planned on taking 20 seeds. I chewed them in my mouth and swished them around a bit. After swallowing I was waiting. And waiting and wating, I waited. 2 1/2 hours later I was still feeling baseline. This was upset. I thought ah well I'd try again on the weekend. But I just couldnt help my self I ate 20 more seeds and waited an hour. I fell asleep. I was extreamly tired from being up all the previous night for a mushroom trip. I hate 2 large bottles of water next to me so if it does kick in during the night I can have a drink.

When I woke up this morning the water was gone. My shoes are in a different place, my clothes were off and I was laying in the middle of the floor. I bet I had a pretty mild trip. I am known to sometimes sleep walk so this could have just furthered that. Idk. If I did have a trip it would have been better to be awake for it. Oh well.</bodytext></report>
