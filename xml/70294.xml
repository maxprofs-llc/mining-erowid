While I was at the verity store, I saw these little bottles at the checkout. They were Refined Ginseng Extract. I recongised the name Ginseng from energy drinks so I bought one. I thought I would just feel like I drank a cup of tea, but it was completely different, about 5 minutes after drinking I felt warm fullness and a euphoric clarity. I am planning to use again.</bodytext></report>
