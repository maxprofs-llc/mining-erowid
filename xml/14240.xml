I started the evening out about 5:00 P.M. by smoking  a few bowls. We smoked until about nine, at which time my friend who had tried celexa before asked me if I wanted to try a pill.  I took one and initially felt nothing. We smoked some more and I went to bed about 11:30. At one in the morning, I woke up with a crawling feeling all over. Kind of like a bad case of the jitters. I got up and came to play on the computer. Suddenly, I felt kinda trippy. The room was sort of shaking around me, I was aware of what was going on, but confused also. The computer seemed to make me feel worse, so I just sat there with it off. From there, my mind just floated away. I thougt about a million different things, and suddenly understood things I hadn't before. I've tripped before on acid, and this wasn't quite the same thing. No visuals really, just a mild trip that allowed me to think. I tried to go back to bed about 2:30, and couldn't sleep. Don't know when I when I passed out, but I wasn't able to sleep very well. I got up at nine this morning.

It's 10:30 now, I'm I'm still feeling it. I'm completely able to perform whatever I need to do, but I'm sort of loopy and light headed. I feel like I do when I take a cold or allergy medicine that is supposed to make me sleep, but I can't (like say, if I am at work or school) and fight it off. That sort of disconnected feeling. Overall, it was fun, but I wouldn't recommend taking it and expecting to do anything the next day.</bodytext></report>
