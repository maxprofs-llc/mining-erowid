/n is also known as /n a.k.a /n, an opiate agonist used for moderate to severe pain, with an equivalency of 7.5 mg of pethidine to 1 mg of morphine in parenteral administration. Pethidine/meperidine has a duration of 2 hours so it's a pretty short acting opioid. I was out doctor shopping the whole of last night and didn't get a hit out of the five medical establishments I went to. I guess six is my lucky number coz I managed to get a pethidine IM injection from it. =D

This is /n made by /n (Malaysia). I have never tried pethidine IM injection so imagine my glee as I made this happen. ,)
/n
/n
/nYou were here for DF-118 last time right? The medical record says you have a bad back.
/n
/nI actually had a slipped disc (actually, I don't ,)) and it slipped again for the second time.
/n
(makes 'ouch face', grimaces and made as if my spinal cord was killing me)
/n
/nDo we have DF-118 here? (talking to nurse)
/n
/n(after rummaging through the restricted access medication cabinet, they don't have it, I know that coz I've been here before) No we don't, but we have Voltaren.
/n
/nDo you want something else? I can give you another pain-killer.
/n
/n(Hell no! It's opiates or nothing) Doctor, I hope you can help coz I'm in a lot of pain right now. Can you write a script or something?
/n
/nOkay, do you have a medical history of your slipped disc?
/n
/nYeah, I had an MRI and X-Ray done in KL, where it happened (which didn't happen, of course ,)) and the prognosis was a slipped disc, which I slipped again just now (*grimace of pain*)
/n
/nDo you have it with you?
/n
/nNo, I'm sorry doctor, I left the medical documents in KL...
/n
/nOkay, well since you have a prior here, I'll script you. Is there anything else?
/n
/n(pushing my luck, deciding to go for gold) Hey, I know this is a strange question, but I'm in a lot of pain right now, do you have anything to help me get through tonight? Can you give me a morphine shot? (Prays to God he doesn't go amok)
/n
/nMorphine...hmm...well, we do have morphine but we don't give it to outpatients. I think we have pethidine though, do you want that?
/n
/nIs pethidine an opiate? (Knowing full well it is, but no harm in playing the dumb patient)
/n
/nYes it is.
/n
(Writes /n on my medical record)
/n
/n(looks) (tries not to grin) (tries not to grin again, perhaps somewhat unsuccessfully) Thank you very much doctor.
/n
/nAlright, just lie there and I'll prep the shot.
/n
/n(puts on a show of painful lying down and bolts straight up, apparently with a good back again) Hey, I'm sorry doctor, another unusual request, can I take a photo of the pethidine vial?
/n
/nWhy?
/n
/nIt's just an interest of mine. (starts photoshoot of the IM pethidine 50 mg snap off ampoule) Thanks doctor.
/n
/nOkay, I'm going to inject you now. Turn over.
/n
/nEr...can I take the IM injection in my arm? (I don't want the doctor to see my thigh, which is the best place to bang shit if you're holding down a professional job - full of scar marks and bruises from injections - he would have known for sure I'm an IDU - Injecting Drug User).
/n
/n(Grips my arm) Seems to be okay here.
/n
/n(starts filming the procedure)

/n
/nIs it in? Pethidine 50 mg?
/n
/nMmm...
/n
/nOkay, IM, sixthseal.com (Jesus Christ, I should not have said that in the video but it just slipped out).
/n
(sounds of pethidine injection process)
/n
/nYeah, that's the place.
/n
/nHmm...why do you have some bruises here?
/n
(OMG those are my IM injection spots when I was injecting ketamine)
/n
/nEr...uh...they're some just bruises, ya know. I probably hit something.
/n
(Quickly changes subject)
/n
/nSo, is that pethidine 50 mg?
/n
/nYeah.
/n
/nThanks.

/n
/n
/nAre you driving?
/n
/nEr...no. (actually I am)
/n
/nThis will cause the usual opiate side effects, drowsiness etc. so be careful.
/n
/nI will, my friend is just outside (actually no one is outside, I don't take friends on doctor shopping expedition after a disastrous incident where I lost a good doctor coz me and my friend was stoned and high on meth and she had a laughing fit).
/n
/nOkay, here is your script. You're not a drug addict are you?
/n
/n(*coughs and nearly chokes*) Of course I'm not. I hate drugs. ,) (I didn't wink, I'm just winking on the blog)
/n
/nGood.

(10 minutes after the shot)
/n
/nI'm not feeling it yet, doctor? How long does it take to kick in?
/n
/nIt's not going to be so fast.
/n
/nSo we can't IV pethidine huh?
/n
/n(gives me a strange look) No, it's for IM.
/n
/nOkay, thank you very, very much doctor.
/n
(Shakes doctor's hand very vigorously, perhaps too enthusiastic to be unsuspicious)

T+ 0:30: A general feeling of elation and well being. Don't know if it's the pethidine or the euphoria of getting away with a shot of pethidine just like that.
/n
T+ 0:45: Cigarettes smokes well, like on opiates but it's nowhere near as strong as dihydrocodeine. It does give a rather pleasant high though - kinda chill, but still motivated, I'm typing this as we speak, which I usually don't.
/n
T+ 1:00: I think this is the peak - it's nothing special - I could compare it to a cross between tramadol and codeine if that makes sense. It feels like tramadol + codeine...and er, it seems a wee bit hallucinatory, I don't know how to explain it, it's like the feeling when I get a hit of LSD and am about to come up and trip, but it never happens. I just mentioned it coz I saw the cigarette smoke drifting off. Perhaps a more apt description would be a very mild case of Ambien induced hallucinations.
/n
T+ 1:30: Hey, I'm feeling a little of that opiate warmth now. It's nice but too mild for my tolerance.
/n
/n
50 mg of pethidine wasn't enough to get me off, but I did feel good - which part of it is the phethedine and which part is the elation of pulling this shit off is subjective. I'm full of glee though. :)

/n IM feels a lot like a combination of tramadol and codeine at doses of 100 mg and 300 mg respectively. There is a general feeling of well being and slight stimulation but with some of the jitteriness of tramadol (very mild). It's more like a cross between tramadol and codeine. The opiate warmth is present but mild. At my tolerance level, 50 mg of pethidine isn't much, but at least I can feel it...and I'm STILL feeling st0ked about pulling this off! =D</bodytext></report>
