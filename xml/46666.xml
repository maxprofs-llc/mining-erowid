Last night was my first shroom trip...hectic. It was late at night, I asked a friend for some weed, he didn't have any, so he offered me some shrooms instead. I didn't think much of it, brown leathery things in a ziplock bag that smelled like cowshit...my friend left after a while and I decided to dig in. I forgot to ask him how much to munch, so just to be safe,I ate it all!  /n

30 mins later...

I had no idea... I started to feel confused and at the same time I started laughing like a mad man! I decided to lie down and  sunk into my pillow. Energy waves surged through my skull and my mind dissipated into wonderland... I couldnt feel my heart, nor my pulses, I couldn't or didn't want to move, I accepted my fate and prepared for death...

It was a wondeful feeling.. just before i left earth, some kind of electrical surge went up my spine and all around my brain tissue, i could distinctly feel excactly where it was.. amazing..

My body contracted and and my lungs expanded,a burst of air entered my body, and an array of colours clouded my vision, this is when i realised I had forgotten to breath...
