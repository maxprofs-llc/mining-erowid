I had a bottle of a product called Kava Max, which contained 55 mg Kavalactones and 55 mg Valerian root per pill.  I had taken 6 one time, and had no effects at all.  It didn't even make me sleepy, and the bottle indicated 1 pill would be enough.  I did some research and found that when in high doses (&gt; 1 gram) there is some mild narcotic activity.

I fasted for 6 hours and thought about how many I should take.  I decided to take all the rest (26) as it seemed like a relatively safe drug.  It has a really bitter, almost phlegmy taste.  I managed to get down all 26 without vomiting.

I'm still not feeling anything.  I'm beginning to wonder if I need the actual root for any effects.

Slight numbing in my face, I feel a little congested, but it may be because I'm getting over a cold.  Sort of relaxed, it's about 9:30 now and I usually don't get tired until about 11.

Definately feeling something.  Very bizzare, very subtle, seems like my thought patters are a bit off.  Sort of like a marijuana afterglow.  I have perfect coordination, and I can speak coherently.  This may just be a placebo effect.

Next Day:  I just woke up after a deep 10 hour sleep.  I went to bed early, lying there for about 2 hours.  I was stuck with a strange feeling like I was right about to fall asleep.  Lying in bed was very comfortable, when I got up to get a glass of water, I felt like I wasn't really walking, like I was still in the same place.  It was a vaguely disconnected feeling, but nowhere near intense.  I also realized I was breathing slower than usual. When I finally feel asleep, I have very vivid, realistic dreams.  Kava + Valerian was a very subtle combination, almost unnoticable.  It wasn't worth paying for, but it's still an interesting experience.</bodytext></report>
