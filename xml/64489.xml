I am 17 years old and have done my share of drugs I could not ever list them and I am very expiranced. I was in a complete business mindset at the time and I was issued hydrocodone for about a week. A friend of mine (J) was at my house and brought some Propoxyphene which I had only done once before with T. We each dropped some bomb dose at the same time that we took 3 Darvocets, and 4 vicodens each and then went to go smoke a quad of some canadian hydro.

That was when things took on a different meaning. I was not tripping yet but things just didn't make any sense. I cannot remember to much of the expirance but I remember the pills and pot hit me hard and I was completely detached from reality thinking nonsense. And for some reason I kept blacking out.

Then that acid hit and the whole expirance turned into a twisted reality of a parallel universe. The only thing I can compare it to was datura. Everything was complete delirium and I didn't even think I was fucked up till it cam down.

I ended up with a pile of 5 and a half (yes a half) cigarettes that were lit backwards when I came to the next morning and I was told by my mom that she had to help me out from under my dresser 3 times in one hour because I was too fucked up to get out and my friend was passed out.

All in all it was not worth it because I remember hardly anything.</bodytext></report>
