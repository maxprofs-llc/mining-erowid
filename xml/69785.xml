One summer I bought my mom Coleus seeds for her birthday. They have grown now into 5 huge bushes, probably around 4 feet wide and 2 - 3 feet tall. After reading that Coleus was psychoactive, I decided to test out this claim.

I picked off 70 leaves that were no smaller than an inch across and no larger than 3 inches across, and placed them in a blender, along with hot water, and left the nasty looking mush to sit for a few hours.

I poured the water into a large cup and added some lemon juice and sugar to it for taste, along with some milk, so as to cover the nasty flavor. I consumed it.

2 hours later I started to get the feeling that it was psychoactive. The feeling I get on a low dose of LSD or Morning Glory seeds, where I feel all warm and fuzzy and feel like I am about to cross over into a full blown trip. This was that feeling, and there was no mistaking it. It definitely was active. This feeling increased, as well as a not-unpleasant, hard to explain feeling of being isolated in a very large space.

Although I never 'broke through to the other side', I am 100% certain that what I consumed was psychoactive, and in no way a placebo. I will continue to experiment with this plant.</bodytext></report>
