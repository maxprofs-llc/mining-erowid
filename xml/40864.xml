The first time I tried K was at a free party a few months ago. I hadn't taken nearly enough, that night, to K hole... Just so it felt I was flying. I didn't fancy being 'knocked out' in that situation.

The weekend just past, I attended another party. Over the course of the night (3-10am) I had consumed about 2 litres of cider and 1.5 pills (plus a few tokes from a few joints throughout the night). As my friend just told me we were about to leave, I remembered that I hadn't had any K... My mission for that party was to score a gram and try some in the comfort of my own room. I asked a friend I had made at the party if he knew any reliable people about and was informed of someone who had freshly baked some. The wrap cost me 20 quid... Handed the money over and home I went.

The drive home seemed to take forever; almost being stopped by the police and having to stop for tea/cig-buying on the way.

Just knowing that I had a gram of the stuff that made me feel so happy last time was enough to keep me from falling asleep!

Finally got home at around midday and I immediately went to my room. Normally I'd have a hot bath and then sleep, but this time would be different! I got changed and sat in my bed. With the radio on in the background, I cut myself a line or two. The amount I actually prepared is a bit hazy, to tell the truth, but I know I had enough to K hole within an hour of spaced-out intervals of taking each line.

A sudden glowing warmth came over me and my mouth felt as though it were a tunnel to another world. I think my jaw was slowly lowering, so that all the surrounding positive energy could make its way into me, or something. When I opened my eyes, I could see little animals forming in the patterns of my curtains (which are cow-print). All of a sudden, one of these animals frowned an evil frown at me and bore fangs. Remembering my friend saying that she just talks to evil spirits she sees in acid trips, making all well again, I managed to whisper 'hello there, let's be friends'.  Immediately, the animal smiled and nodded in agreement. After closing my eyes once again, my head started to feel as though it were tilting back, far more than physically possible. This felt very comforting, for some reason, but I opened my eyes to see that I had not actually moved at all. All the while I was aware that everything I was experiencing was due to the Ketamine, so I didn't get frightened when very odd things happened.

I closed my eyes again and it felt as though I were travelling through a golden tunnel with a lovely light wrapping my body. There were oriental people dancing around me, smiling all the while. I don't remember much else after that, apart from feeling very happy and content with life. After a little while, I fell into a deep sleep.

I woke up at about 7:30pm and went to meet some friends of mine. I felt a bit shakey and tired, but nothing unexpected from the long weekend I'd just had. After what seemed forever at the pub (no alcohol consumed), I went home and had a good few more lines of K (again, I now have no concept of how much I took but I remember it being a lot).

This trip wasn't as happy as the last one, but fun nonetheless. I laid down, having no idea what the hell my pillows were for, but leaning on them anyway. The bed felt as though it were moving through air and that someone was massaging my sore feet. This was nice until it seemed as though I had reached a rather horrible place... There were dark blue foors and ceilings, all rocky, but no walls. Where there should have been walls, was a darkness stretching out into eternity. All of a sudden, an evil-looking creature came toward me. I could somehow sense that it didn't have evil intentions, as it seemed to be telling me that it was lonely in hell and that whenever it visited people they always got frightened. I wasn't very scared after it 'explained' (I use this term loosely as it never actually spoke) itself. I also remember flying through a business meeting and dinner party.  Again, my mouth was like a tunnel to a different, better world only, this time, the light was blue.

The next day I went into another K Hole as soon as I woke up, taking almost 8 fat lines of K within half an hour or so. I don't remember anything from this trip, apart from feeling nice. That evening I had the last of the wrap which was saddening, but relieving as I knew I would have used it more and more and more if it were available.

In conclusion, I don't think I will carry on using this drug often as I can see myself getting too 'into' it.</bodytext></report>
