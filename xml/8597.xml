I am currently having one of the most wretched drug experiences of my life, thanks to yohimbe.

First, a little background; I'm a sufferer of clinical depression, and I'm on a regimen of drugs which seriously depresses my sexual response.  Having heard that yohimbe could combat this side-effect, I purchased a quantity of yohimbe bark from a local herb-shop and tried it out.

I made a tea by placing about 2 tablespoons of the bark in a tea ball and steeping it in boiling hot water for 5-10 minutes.  The tea, sweetened with honey, was drinkable and not particularly foul tasting.  I noticed the effects within an hour; I felt sped up, uncomfortable, and a little nauseous.  Paradoxically, I also felt like lying down (I wish I felt that way now.)

It's some eight hours later and I'm completely unable to go to sleep; the normally cheerful prospect of lying down in bed with my boyfriend is impossible to contemplate, because I can't sit still for more than five minutes and I don't want to wake him up.  I resorted to alcohol, the only depressant I had on hand, to try to get to sleep, but it was no use.  I've lost track of the number of times I've had to get up to pee; evidently this stuff exerts a diuretic effect.  Also, I notice a mydriatic effect; my pupils are wide and dilated.  The effect on my mood has not been pleasant, either; I've found myself dwelling on unpleasant things and experiencing something like panic.

It came as little consolation that I was, in fact, able to have sex; I got little pleasure from it.

I may try this again at a significantly lower dosage, because it did do what it was supposed to do, sort of.  But right now it's looking as though I'm not to get a wink of sleep before sunrise, and that's a depressing thought.</bodytext></report>
