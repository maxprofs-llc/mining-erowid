I was at home one day, and my parents were out, so I was alone. I had nothing to do. At the time I was feeling quite relaxed, as that day I had just finished one very difficult assignment for school, so I didn't care about anything at the time. My dad had a can of duster near his computer, so I went and got it. I shook it, and sprayed it onto a piece of tissue until it was soaked with duster liquid, and then put the tissue to my mouth and inhaled hard.

After holding it in for about 10 seconds, I felt the usual pulsating sound in my ears, as well as a rippling feeling in my whole body. It was a great feeling, so I sprayed some more, and inhaled it. I did this for about 3 more times. With that I felt as if I had gone into an alternate reality, parallel to this one. Things remained the same, but yet they seemed so different. I felt that I could be both the child I were long ago, and the person I am right now at the same time.

What amazes me is the intense realization that 'There is no beginning' that swept over me all of a sudden. I kept feeling that no matter how far back I go, I can never reach the beginning of everything. Another interesting feeling that I had was that there was two of everything. Two lives, two myselves, even simple things such as two alphabets. I then realized that some weird memories were popping up in my head. Memories, that were obviously false, such as remembering seeing a big giant bird coloured like the rainbow, made of flames. However, although knowing that these memories were not true, at the same time, I believed them whole heartedly.

Right about now I came to, and found myself in the kitchen, with the tissue and can of duster in my hand. I huffed again, this time feeling a light tingling feeling in my throat. I didn't take any notice of that at all, and huffed again. Random thoughts were entering my head again. I tried huffing a third time when I felt death. the tingling feeling in my throat turned into a feeling like about 20 long sharp needles, piercing from under my throat, into my brain. I felt I could actually taste the metal piercing through my tongue. I felt like I couldn't move at all. Like everything had ended. A realization came over me, that although the beginning can never be reached, the end can come quite easily. I was really afraid at the time.

After about some time, I came to, and found I was lying on the floor. I capped the can of duster and put it back where I had found it, threw away the tissue, and vowed to myself never to do that again. It was a great experience at first, with a lot of things I still think about to this day, but its ending was horrible. I remained freaked out for about thirty minutes afterwards.

It was a memorable experience, and somehow, it changed the way I think about life. However I do not want to try it again.</bodytext></report>
