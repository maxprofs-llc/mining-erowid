It started pretty good with me and my friends hearing about a new substance to put in a blunt when we rolled it to make us trip out.

Thats not how it worked. We ended up coating a swisher with it and rolling it up. After that everything backfired. We smoked it and immediately began feeling more depressed than I've ever been in my life. I tripped and fell flat on my face and passed out. I layed in the same position until the next morning. I've learned since to never try anything new until I see someone do it first, its not the best plan but its better than wasting your life in the driveway.</bodytext></report>
