First off, a little about myself. I am moderately to highly experienced with phenethylamines and tryptamines (MDMA, MDA, MDE, Mescaline, DMT, Psilocin, LSD, LSA, 5-MeO-DMT, etc...) Amongst other psychopharmaceuticals/psychoactives, but this is besides the point...

For the past two months my primary focus has been with Syrian Rue. My first experience being pretty bum because of the fact I was working with ground seeds and the taste was absolutely unbearable to deal with. And packing all that shit into 00 capsules would be very very time-consuming, and I'm pretty lazy. SO... instead of dealing with the bullshit, I decided to make a 'tea' from about 15-20g of ground rue seeds. I did this by mixing two cups water in a pyrex bowl with the ground seeds, adding 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I boiled this for about 10 minutes, filtered the seed matter, and repeated this process again using the same ingredients but with the leftover/'used' seed much. I let this boil for about 10 minutes, while stirring. I then filtered out the mush and threw it away. I added the two end products to one big pyrex pot and cooked it down to a brownish red resin, periodically checking my extraction using a blacklight to indicate the presence of 'the good shit'.

After this was cooked down, I put it in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes, and cut it into chunks that could be easily dropped to the BACK part of my toungue (if any of this goop gets on my lips or tip of my toungue, it makes me gag)
/n
/n
To begin with, I ate about 3/4 of the goop, Note: After already injesting about a shotglass full of unground seeds several hours earlier (nasty!)
/n
/n
T+15 minutes: After eating the first 1/4 of the goop, I felt some slight effects, mostly mild tracers. Nothing special.
/n
/n
I then thought to myself, 'How bad do I wanna trip?'
/n
/n
I got out the bottle of pop, and started dropping those little balls/chunks down my throat, chasing it down with pop. I got to where I could drop them down without tasting them, and if I did get the taste, I took a *small* bite of some chocolate I had out, which was a great remedy for that situation.
/n
/n
T+30 minutes: After giving up on eating it all, (which is a good thing I did only eat about 3/4 of the shit), I noticed the sliding tracers when I moved my head, or when I looked at the computer screen and looked back down, the whole screen would follow my visual field. This was only the beginning.
/n
/n
T+50 minutes: In my room, I felt the urge to lie down, feeling somewhat sedated but not so much that I couldn't stay awake. Every time I moved my head, EVERYTHING, especially the television, and miscellaneous lights in my room would follow, but they didnt just follow my visual field, they went back to where they came from. I closed my eyes hoping for some CEVs but really got nothing but I bunch of weird daydreams. After about an hour of lying down hiding from the bright colors and tracers, I got up to go to the other room. Oh god was that crazy. I wasnt completely staggering around, but had to be careful when I walked. I opened the door, and the whole door made a tracer, and then the tracer 'sprung back' from the door panel where it came from.
/n
/n
T+70 minutes: This, I thought, was gonna be it, pretty interesting, but not that great. Boy was I wrong. I went to the other room for about 30 minutes and layed down in the dark. I felt like I was gonna puke and got up to go to the other room, when I was greeting with THE MOST INTENSE tracers, and visual field 'sliding' and 'gliding' that I've EVER experienced. I could barely make out what was on the television, for there were about 5 images of what was on the screen floating around the television. Not to mention the light on my ceiling fan that was duplicated by about six tracers and rotated around it. Not only this, but every time I moved my focus, the WHOLE ROOM with all of it's almost sickeningly bright tracers of color followed and slid back and forth.
/n
/n
About 10 minutes later, I ended up puking, and felt better. All in all, I threw up three times that night, and before I retired to the 'dark room' to escape from the tracers, both from the bright objects in my room and my visual field tracers, the above description multiplied by about 2x. Nothing but colors so bright I just had to close my eyes and escape.
/n
/n
I had few dreams THAT night, but all in all, the mental aspect of the trip, wasn't profound at all. I did not feel social, I just wanted to either walk around, ride in a car, or lay there. I was not all giddy like with most tryptamines or phenethylamine-type 'psychedelics', as in, I didn't have a cheesed-out, uncontrollable grin with the wide-eyed stare accompanied by pupilary dilation. Just a HUGE AMOUNT of visual disturbances, pleasurable but almost annoying when indulged in for too long.
/n
/n
I do not plan on experimenting with this any further as I got the peak effects. I do plan on using it in a smaller dosage with maybe some LSA, or some kind of tryptamine (maybe DMT), that does not produce nausea (nausea in me anyways, as LSA does cause many to puke). I feel that the mental experience of the other tryptamines combined with the visual aspect of the harmala extract could prove quite interesting and insightful, as well as more pleasurably visual for that matter.
/n
/n
Note:  The vomiting may have been the prime result of ignoring the MAOI (monoamine-oxidase inhibition) factor of the harmaline and eating 5 eggs with cheese and 'Lou1siana hot sauce' doused on top, heheh.
/n
/n
The whole experience peaked/hit in about 2 hours, lasted about 5-6 hours. All in all, highly interesting, HIGHLY visual but limited to intense tracers and visual field 'gliding' when I moved my head around (the TV would actually follow along with my visual field after turning away from it. No profound mental insights, only weird daydreams that lead to nothing and made no sense, just entertaining. I still feel mental clouding as this experience was of last night).
/n
/n
Follow-up: For several days I have had very unusual dreams, to the point that I can remember them quite distinctly. My REM-stage of sleep has been totally overloaded with crazy, out of this world dreams (more so then usual anyways), some pleasurable, and almost mood-lifting upon waking. Not the type of 'cool' dream that you wake up disappointed because it was only a dream. Mainly dreams of past memories, but distorted at the same time, and fun dreams, like floating and flying, etc. You get the point. Still very cool though, but anyways, stay safe - stay aware!
