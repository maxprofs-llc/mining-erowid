At the beginning the feeling was euphoria.  Focused, alert, talkative, and attentive.  Then I went on for about 2 months and went spiraling downward.  I worked part time during this period restoring wood workings.  All the restored work looked amazing and I was exercising daily, yet the result of this psychoactive on my body was horrendous.

The first thumbs down, was the odor I began excreting.  I was constantly reminded of rotten milk and dried sweat.  Next, I started to constantly produce saliva, my tongue was in constant motion, and my eyes were bouncing around like the game pong.  My food schedule was nearly 6 meals a day; 20 to 30 minutes after consuming food and drink I was using the restroom.  Approximately a month and a half into everyday use was using some and immediately vomited a glowing radioactive colored substance.  Around this time I no long had a job.  Later, I started speaking out loud incessantly and in the morning I could not tell if I had slept the night before.

Months passed and I am returning to my regular old non-slime puking, less on the go-go-go self.  BE CAREFUL IF ONE DECIDES TO USE MDPV DAILY.</bodytext></report>
