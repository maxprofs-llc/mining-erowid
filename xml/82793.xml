S and I woke up at around 10 AM, having planned this day specifically for our psychedelic adventure. This was pretty much the first time we'd spent any significant amount of time together in person, even though we've known each other for years. He was home from college for winter break and I was visiting him. His mom was at work, so we had the whole day to enjoy to ourselves. I had not tripped for two weeks prior to now (apart from a very low dose of DMT the week before, but I don't count that), which is significant, because for several weeks I had been tripping every weekend. I had abstained from tripping intentionally in preparation for today.

We measured out our doses - for me, one cap with 46mg 4-AcO-DMT and one with 140mg methylone; for him, 41mg 4-AcO-DMT and 120mg methylone. I would have taken more methylone, as in my past experiences with methylone, 100mg was too small to produce significant effects, and tended to be very brief; I felt that for me, 200mg was a good, strong, and lasting dose. I was not sure what sort of effects 140mg would produce. However, S only had so much methylone left, so my dose was 140mg. We decided we would take the 4-AcO-DMT first and wait until we were approaching the peak to take the methylone, since (in my experience at least) methylone tends to come on more quickly than 4-AcO-DMT. We took our 4-AcO-DMT doses with water at approximately 10:45 AM. I had an empty stomach, while S had a bowl of cereal for breakfast.

I began to notice the first effects of 4-AcO-DMT within 15 minutes, which surprised me, as in my past experience, psychedelics take longer than average to come on for me. I felt a strange energy throughout my body; not a wholly comfortable feeling, but not uncomfortable either. Within another 5 or 10 minutes, I began to notice things warping and shifting; I felt apprehensive, because 4-AcO-DMT has never come on so rapidly for me and I was wondering exactly how hard and how fast it was going to hit me.

Within another 10 minutes I had achieved a state that I would describe succinctly as 'tripping balls.' The entire room morphed before my eyes; the popcorn on the ceiling transformed into elegant geometric patterns, and the curtains across the room rippled and waved in psychedelic motion. I closed my eyes and watched intricate colors dance behind my eyelids. The entire environment was transformed in a matter of minutes, and I was not prepared for it. I quickly found myself regretting the dose of 4-AcO-DMT, which I had previously considered modest because of my past experiences with similar dosages (which, perhaps due to varying stomach contents, tended to be longer but milder.) I was faced with the realization that there was no turning back now; I had no benzodiazepines on hand because I was far from home, which heightened my distress. (I have never taken a benzodiazepine to 'abort' a trip before, but I always like to keep them on hand as a sort of mental comfort.)

S was not feeling much more than the normal anticipation that precedes a trip, and I did not express my mental state to him. Instead, I forced myself to take the cap of methylone, and encouraged him to take his as well; I did not think that it would significantly improve my mental state, but it was the only way I felt I could change the dark direction that my trip was heading in.

I watched TV while I waited for the methylone to come on. I remember I was watching CNN, and I felt keenly aware of how manipulative and biased the programming on the station was. S had gone to take a shower at this point, so while I wanted to rant and rave about it, I couldn't. I continued watching and observing, all the time with an air of mingled fascination and disgust at how insidiously biased CNN's reporting was.

I did not keep good track of time after I took the methylone, but I believe I began to feel the full effects of the methylone within 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion. In my past experiences with methylone, 100mg was too small a dose to produce significant and long-lasting effects; this time, however, I definitely felt my 140mg dose more strongly than a 100mg dose. The visuals of the trip took a back seat to my mental state; I became extremely talkative, friendly, and silly, and S retrieved a goose-down waterproof sleeping bag for me, which I proceeded to bury my face in because it felt so wonderful and soft.

I told stories about different things to S, and he listened intently, without much to say himself even when I prompted him to tell some stories of his own, which I thought was a bit unusual because he usually gets quite talkative on methylone.

At around 12:30 PM, my endless chattering was cut short by the rattling of the doorknob when S's mom came home early from work because she wasn't feeling well. S made to turn on the game system, and I casually chatted with his mom; we both managed to escape attracting suspicion from S's good-natured but somewhat oblivious mother. His mom told him that he had scheduled a doctor's appointment for him at 2:45 PM, and that she was going to take a nap, and that he should wake her up in time for his appointment. We agreed without too much deliberation that we should let her sleep and skip the appointment.

We played video games for a while, and my visuals came back to me in full force, making it nearly impossible to play the game. After a short while we realized it was a hopeless endeavor and decided to head outside to the park. At this point things began to get awkward; S still found himself at a loss for words, and I had no talk left in me. Within perhaps 4 or 5 hours of dosing, I began to feel that the 4-AcO-DMT and methylone had almost left me; S, on the other hand, was still wrapped up in his mental state. I made several attempts to get some things done that we'd planned, but I could not effectively communicate what I wanted to do to S, which led to a lot of frustrating and pointless walking back and forth. We ended up sitting in near-silence for a long time as I waited for S to come down enough so that we could head back.

Ultimately, I considered the day a good one, even if S and I had some communication issues. S seems to think very differently of the day, but either way, I felt it was a learning experience for both of us. 4-AcO-DMT and methylone are a match made in heaven as far as I'm concerned, and I'm looking forward to exploring both substances even more, both on their own and in combination.</bodytext></report>
