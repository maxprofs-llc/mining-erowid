Last year I had a strange dream. This is the recollection of that dream:
/n

I had happened across a potted cacti that was identified as San Pedro. Having read various reports on the strength of San Pedro and from past experiences, I decided to ingest two feet, dried. I ground it in a coffee grinder and capped it into '0' capsules. This produced 96 capsules. I've read similar methods of ingestion where people ate 100 '00' capsules with great success. I've heard that the weakest San Pedro contains no mescaline while the most potent San Pedro is twice the potency of peyote. The cacti I acquired were the latter (unbeknown to me when I ingested the capsules).

Within fifteen minutes I felt a strong alert. Within 30 minutes I was starting to experience strong CEV and OEV. I decided I needed to lie down. This didn't help. At forty-five minutes I decided that I was tripping way too hard for the amount of time that had passed. Enter 'the fear.' I was pondering inducing vomiting. There was no need for this, at the one hour mark, my body had already decided that the contents of my stomach must be purged. 'La purge' was the worst I've ever experienced. It felt like my stomach was being twisted like water being wrung from a washcloth. In fact, at the end I even spit up a tiny amount of blood.
/n

At this point in time, time itself kinda lost all meaning, so the follow events probably are not in chronological order. I was experiencing the most intense visuals I've ever seen. Everything was replaced by 'geometric' hallucinations. I decided that I should lie down. As I lay there, I was passing in and out of consciousness. Definitely over amping. At about the 3 hour mark I was still going up up up.
/n
/n
I then noticed that I had to go to the bathroom immediately. I then had the most nasty diarrhea that I've ever had. I don't remember much on the toilet as I was passing in and out of consciousness. At one point I remember falling off the toilet. Flush. After flushing, I realized that my stomach had not in fact been emptied. Thus, I threw up again. This time it was 'La Grande Purge.' Worse than earlier. Cups and cups of undigested cacti matter. The taste was horrid. I then sat back on the toilet to try to get a grip. I then had an experience straight out of the pages of a Terrence McKenna DMT report.

I was sitting there, on the john, with my eyes closed. When I felt the presence of some 'other' intelligence in my mindspace. I saw the entity. It then began to attempt to communicate by forming different polydimentional objects in my mindscape. I understood what it was saying. It then attempted to teach me it's 'written' language which was actually multi-dimensional symbols that resembled sort of a Japanese/Klingon script. Then it was time to go on a ride. It appeared to me that we were traveling through some sort of wormhole or hyperspacial transit system. At the end of the tunnel was a galactic cluster. We singled out one galaxy and traveled to it. Singled out one star, and traveled to it's system. Then to a planet. The whole planet was alive. Literally. It had a civilization living on it. The city covered probably 1/4th of the planet. Kinda like on Star Wars or Contact or something.
/n
/n
This is where things gets weird (no, really!). The entity communicated with me that it could show me more of the city, but to do so, he would have to use/inhabit a larger portion of my mindscape. So I agreed. When that limit was reached, it made the proposal again, 'give me more, and I'll show you more.' I agreed again. But this time it occurred to me that the more I gave the less I perceived. I believe this was a trap or an infinite loop of sorts. I question that if I hadn't have 'snapped out of it' that I could have lost my mind completely. This was a very intense and frightening experience.
/n
/n
I take it this was the peak. I had been sitting on the pot for about 2 hours now and decided to go lay back down. I kept passing in and out of consciousness for probably the next 5 hours or so before I began to reach some sort of level 'normal' for psychedelic exploration. This was more intense than any yage, Salvia, LSD, shrooms, AMT, 2C-T-7, or 2C-I experience I've had. I've eaten and smoked these substances at 'heroic' doses. The whole experience lasted over 18 hours. I figure I must have absorbed over one gram of mescaline.
/n

I've eaten San Pedro before this, and never lost it. But after this experience, I have vowed never to eat anything that contains mescaline again. It will take 15-20 lifetimes to integrate what happened to me. Beware the San Pedro. Some is super weak, but some kicked my ass all the way to Alpha Centauri. (And aliens attempted to take over my mind!)</bodytext></report>
