One time a long time ago, although I can recall it quite well, I was all alone at home and very bored and feeling very depressed. I had a sense of self-loathing that I still have today. But this time I was willing to take risks even knowing the potential dangers and outcomes.

I had tried sniffing markers a few times before this, with little luck. Just a pounding headache and some dizziness. Since the markers didn't screw up I thought I would try glue. I searched a cupboard for some super glue and found it. I promptly took the cap off and began sniffing. The smell was awful, but tolerable. I continued to sniff and began feeling a little weird. A bit dizzy, but no headache. I sat down in a chair and waited patiently. It only went down hill from there.

I began to notice a very strange feeling, one that is about impossible to describe. It was as if I had no brain, or my head was empty. Lightheaded could describe it partially but it was more than that. As if there was a big hole in the back of my head. Not painful, but that only made it more frightening. This feeling lasted the whole time I was buzzed. I was feeling paranoid, like if my parents would be home and they would somehow instantly know and yell at me. Worse though was the thought that I would die. I really thought I would die, but I was already dead on the inside and filled with self loathing so I just accepted death and sat, looking around the room reflecting on past events and my life; what I had experienced, accomplished, what I would miss and what I wouldn't.

At some point I began to feel good, quite good. Not very intoxicated, but happy. I had not a worry in the world and I felt a smile stretch across my face. I dunno how long I was like that. Could have been 5 minutes, could have been an hour. It didn't matter anyways because my mind was so clear, I was not doing anything, and nothing happened, so there was nothing to remember.

Then I heard the key entering and turning in the door. My mother came in and started talking about what she would make for supper. I remained mostly silent out of fear for revealing my drug use. I went up to my room and watched television. I didn't really watch it, I just laid there, still, trying to remain calm and ignore the hideous feeling in my head that I described earlier. I tried to reflect on the past yet again, but I couldn't. Instead I thought of strange things, horrible things. Everything I thought of was fleshy and deformed. Reminding me a lot of elephant man or victims of the Chernobyl incident or victims of Agent Orange. Perhaps even a developing human embryo. It's hard to describe being as there was more than one horrifying image in my head, but they all resembled lumpy, fleshy, weird, disgusting creatures. Freaks. But I deserved to be haunted by such ideas, I was and still am a fool and a burden. But I digress...

Even after the 'high' wore off (more like a low) the vivid images of deformed freaks still disturbed me. I slept poorly as I often do, just with scarier nightmares. I regret this endeavor for a few reasons:
/n
/n
1. The experience was awful.
/n
2. The weird fleshy freaks still haunt me in my nightmares today.
/n
3. Despite thinking I was going to die I didn't even cry.
/n
4. For a long time after I ran a bit slower mentally, I obviously had some brain damage from solvent sniffing.

I don't recommend you try huffing solvents.</bodytext></report>
