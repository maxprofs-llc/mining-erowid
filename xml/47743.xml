I had never tried nitrous so I was very cautious about the potential dangers. I wanted to start slow and see what the effects were. When I put the cartridge in the cracker and screwed it down, there was a slow leak and I decided to breathe in the steady slow stream while still getting oxygen from the air around me. Hypoxia is a good way to kill brain cells and I wasn't fond of depleting my precious few. I had attached a long plastic tube to the cracker to give the escaping nitrous time to warm up knowing full well the evaporating gas is extremely cold.

I inhaled slowly and deeply, taking in nitrous mixed with air around me. At first I felt nothing and then suddenly I felt a slight rush followed by a faint orgasmic surge from my groin. The feeling grew and a pleasurable tingling filled my now erect penis. I couldn't resist gently rubbing and touching myself. It seemed like the nerves were more sensitive than normal.

I continued to slowly breath the slow stream of nitrous coming from the cracker. Tingling started in my fingers and toes along with a slight amount of numbness in my lips. I then had another mini-orgasmic like surge followed by a noticeable slowing of visual responses. The tingling in my groin moved into numbness so I decided to back off the nitrous.

Quickly things were back to normal so I decided to try and 'get into the zone' again. I again went back to the leaking nitrous and after a few deep breaths I had yet another mini-orgasmic surge, but this time it was intense enough to cause me to gasp slightly in surprise - so much so like being touched by a mild but intensely pleasurable electric current.

I kept this cycle up for about 15 minutes until I couldn't resist the urge to 'finish the job'. About 10 seconds before orgasm, I inhaled a lung full from a balloon and held my breath until I climaxed. It was amazing and mind blowing in intensity. Time stretched out and the waves of orgasm seem to last 30 seconds.</bodytext></report>
