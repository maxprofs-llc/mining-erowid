I have rolled on MDMA about a dozen times and I wanted to pass on some advice on how to make the roll last a little longer.

So this is what I do: After I start to come down from the first MDMA pill, (usually 3-4 hours after ingestion) I take one 200mg pill of SAM-e. SAM-e is an over-the-counter 'mood stabilizer' that you can find at any drug store. The SAM-e usually kicks my roll back up for another hour to and hour and a half. Then, after the SAM-e finally begins to wear off, I ingest my second MDMA pill. Then, once again after about 3-4 hours of rolling when I come down, I take another 200mg of SAM-e. Taking this 200mg of SAM-e after I begin to come down off of each pill always boosts my roll back up close to peak levels.

I have found that taking SAM-e helps bring back the roll farely well. It's cheaper and probably better on your body than taking 4 whole hits of E in a night. The SAM-e helps bring back a stronger roll when I smoke a clove cigarette or two a few minutes after ingesting the SAM-e.

Ihere seems to be a limit on how much SAM-e is helpful.  I took 800mg of SAM-e one night during an MDMA roll, and crashed REALLY hard the next day. Taking 400-600mg, however, seems to work perfectly for me. I have found also that taking 100-200mg of the dietary supplement 5-HTP helps with the 'blues' that one feels the next day or two. I also take 500mg of the amino acid, L-Tyrosine for depression. I usually take it for a few days during the week after an ecstasy roll until I don't feel so depressed.

Taking the SAM-e might not do anything for you, but it sure seems to work for me. Happy rolling, and take care of each other!!</bodytext></report>
