I did K with my sister and her boyfriend, in the company of two other people who weren't doing it. I was with people I trusted and felt safe around, which I think is important for first time usage. When I did the first line I had come back from a pub and was still quite drunk, so when the K came in I felt nausous. This can ruin the experience, and fortunately wore off before long.

The first effect was an increased drunk feeling, and a feeling of dissociation from the senses of touch and sight, but not sound, that came later. My energy levels went down and it became harder to interact with people who were not on the drug, as my speech was slurred and it was hard to make/maintain eye contact. Walking around became comical as perception of scale and proportion decreased. After about 20 mins my perception was changed in a way that is difficult to explain, or even remember, as everyday terms and ideas do not give much insight into this new way of seeing.

My sister told me to go upstairs and get the hampster so we could observe it in awe. I tried to explain to her the difficulty of the task she had just set me but she wasn't having any of it so I hauled myself off the sofa and proceeded to make my way up the stairs. Once upstairs I decided to stand still and just 'be' for a moment. I was fairly dissociated from my body at this point and I felt like my 'self' was floating at head height and was surprised at my ability to stand up all on my own, as my senses weren't giving me much information. Then I remembered the task at hand, which was to find the hampster, so I looked in my sisters bedroom - how funny it looked! All small and different, like a little underground room. Slowly and carefully I made my way in. Everything seemed dimly lit. The sensation of moving through space was very interesting.

Giving up hope of finding the hampster, I went downstairs. Suddenly I was downstairs in the kitchen! I had a memory of moving between the two points, but my perception of time was very different. Back in the sitting room, I collapsed on the sofa and sunk into it, feeling warm and calm. I floated away. I could still see my surroundings but my brain wasn't processing the visual information in the same way. My imagination was giving it new meaning. The other side of the room could have been far away, the outlines of the cushions on the floor mountain ranges. I closed my eyes and was off in space, slowly travelling backwards and round, clinging onto the memory of the image of the room as my only perception, and therefore the only thing that could confirm I was still here and alive! This could have been frightening, but I knew I was in a safe place and that this was the effect of a drug I had taken, so it was enjoyable.

Because my senses (except for hearing) were not giving my brain any information about my surroundings, I was left with only my mind. In the everyday world, it is hard to visualise the mind because the senses are what I experience, not the mind. Here, the cover of senses was taken away and I could see my 'self' more easily. I felt like I was merging with a collective consiousness. The perception of this was of a feeling of presence and warmth, of being observed, like 'it' knowing I am there and acknowledging me. By this time my hearing was distorted, and I remember hearing 'build-ups' to noises like doors opening and people moving around. I felt when a sound was going to happen before it happened.

I felt very communicative, on a non-verbal level, with the people I could hear moving around. My sister on the floor in front of me held my hand and her presence was so great it almost felt like a form of communication. She was talking quetly under her breath and I remember responding to what she was saying, but not talking back. I remember squeezing her hands occasionally and feeling very connected. Later her boyfriend told us she was having a one-sided conversation.

I felt someone come into the room and I felt an empathy with them. Maybe they were looking at me on the sofa. My sister's boyfriend, who had taken the same amount but was not sofa-bound, came and sat down next to me and I opened my eyes and looked around, still unable to feel my body. He told me to skin up. With slurred speech I told him that that would not be possible, sorry, and laughed. He persisted so I got out my baccy and weed. That was hard because I couldn't really feel the contents of my pocket. I gave him the equipment and told him he was gonna have to do it. When we smoked it only mildly effected me, the K overrulled most of the effect.

After a while everyone went to sleep and so did I, putting an end to a spiritually enlightening and memorable experience. The next day I found I could not remember some 'revelations' and concepts that I promised myself I would remember at the time, so unfortunately these are not included in this writing! I would say that this is a very interesting and intense drug.</bodytext></report>
