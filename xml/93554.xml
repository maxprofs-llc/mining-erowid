This is a trip report you should read slowly. Its content was accomplished in the middle of a trip, including this text. On a phone. Without backspacing, so to speak. I just scrolled back up to introduce myself and make things readable.

Hi, I'm Vigilant, vigilantly influenced by a colourful 30 mg 2C-B capsule and a nasal 70 mg MXE. Although I tend to recommend it, sanity prevails; be careful when combining these drugs. Of course, I'm saying this while a coloured brew of thoughts are dripping off the words I write. And which you read. That I write. You know?

Set and setting? At home, on the couch. Nice and familiar. Half past eight I take my 2C-B cap and an hour later I suddenly realize I can't realize anything and I just go with the flow. I can no longer find the words to think about what I think, it's confusing but at the same time very welcome. It seems like time flies but keeping an eye on the clock I know I can take it easy and relax. I'm experiencing massive feelings of pleasure. Stunning how I see the letters on my screen jump while I type this. Not to mention what happens when I turn away from this screen. Things happen faster than I can keep up thinking. I know I'm writing a trip report but I can't describe it, so I'm switching to keywords like: patterns. Splattering letters. Matrix-like rotations. Feelings. Indescribable. Everything. It's all good. Nice. Wow. Contrast. The present. Vibrations. Shivering through my body. Gradually. Currents of warmth. It's delicious. Tasty, almost. Pure freedom. Wet pixels. I'm half listening to a few people outside who misbehave, drunk idiots challenging the police. I turn my headphones back on. The strange thing is, or was, that while I type this, time seems to shift. An interesting fact. It makes me remember my father asking me this afternoon: 'how's are you doing at work, in the software movement?'. 'lol' I'm thinking now and as I type this I'm seeing the tiles on my floor raise and move around, with solid colours while the tiles are actually black and white. Everything's moving, not only visually but with feelings too, coming up with a gentle earthquake. It's hard to describe something I can't see, I suddenly realize. Strangely funny. I park the thought away under the sheet of feelings that are continuously stirred upon me. An unstoppable light of love shines strongly through my body. I can't describe it, but it's so welcome. The vibrations are flying through me and I notice the time is 0:57. No idea what the time was before. Hmm, strange that I'm wondering about that. I'll type it in anyway. It was 1:48 when I pass here to fix a typo. I'm thirsty. I should go to the kitchen to fetch a new glass of water. Oh wait. First I should stand up, raise my pants and flush. Damn, I've been sitting on the toilet for such a long time. I should post my trip report.</bodytext></report>
