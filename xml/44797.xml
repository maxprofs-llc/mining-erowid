Recently I was in New York city visiting some cousins of mine. I had brought some mushrooms because I find that there is nothing better than tripping in the city. The chaos seems to enhance my trip audibly and visually.

When I pulled out the sack of mushrooms my cousin told me of this sleeping pill he had been prescribed that had caused him to have hypnotic and physchedelic effects. I was skeptical but was willing to give it a try.  I took 10 mg of Ambien, the recommended dosage on the prescription bottle.  Within thirty minutes I could feel the effects.  A slight change in light and a resistance to movement, body tension, etc.

The high was nice but not as intense as what I was looking for. So I decided to take out 5 good looking caps from my bag.  I quickly downed them, grabbed some water and set off for my days adventure.

Within 1:00 my trip was in full force, but with some slight changes.  Normally when I trip I cannot sit still and often find myself pacing and talking incessantly. Instead this time i felt that my limbs were heavy, and often times found myself sitting instead of standing.

I welcomed this feeling as sometimes the nervousness associated with tripping balls is unnerving.

About 1:30 minutes I started to feel a floating sensation when I was walking.  I'm sure I looked retarded to anyone who saw me moon-walking through the park I had resigned to. The floaty feeling was actually quite strange because it didn't some from my head, but rather my stomach.  The feeling lasted about 2:00 hours.

4:00 hours into my trip I started to feel the comedown. This was the only part of the experience that I did not enjoy.  Normally when I eat muchrooms the comedown is quite tame.  I smoke a bowl or two, try to sleep, or take a shower.  However because Ambien is a sedative it made me pass out into a harsh sleep. I had a few bizarre dreams and awoke about three hours later feeling drowsy and slightly nauseated. In all this experience was quite enjoyable.</bodytext></report>
