I also have spent hours and days and months researching all types of psychoactive drugs in books, online, documentaries, erowid reports, etc. I've done everything short of actually getting a degree in organic chemistry, which, come to think of it, I really should look into. I have sampled many drugs, including: LSD, Mushrooms, Marijuana, Ketamine, MDMA, MDA, 4-MMC(Mephedrone, MCAT, or whatever the kids are calling it these days), DXM, Salvia, Cocaine, Methamphetamine (The Devil, Tina), Dextroamphetamine, Coediene, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Buprenorphan, Nitrous, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Alprazolam, Pregalbin (Lyrica) . . . I think that's the whole list.

I identified and studied Methoxetamine about a month ago, during a session of concurrent reading between various websites. I have tried similar drugs before -- Ketamine and DXM, and have found a wide variation in experiences, both substance to substance, and experience to experience. As of about 5 minutes before beginning to type this report, I insuffated roughly 10mg (what is thought to be a 'threshhold' or 'light' dose, based on most of the reports I've read), and can already feel some effects. Much like DXM, I feel a familiar slight burning sensation on my skin, a cool sort of plasticity both in my nose/throat area and in my brain (though I'm sure this is not real.....). So far, I do not really feel 'up' or 'down', just a bit nervous, mostly to do with trying something new. Also, a few minutes before I took it, I read a report of a train wreck experience that someone else had, which prompted me to half the original really tiny pile of powder I was planning to take.  I'm glad I did, as this stuff is remarkably potent. I think the only other drug I have taken that was this potent for such a small pile was Buprenorphan, mind you, that was a 2mg pill and most of the powder was filler -- but it amounted to the same physical size.

Deffinitely feeling effects. Electric rippling sensations down my legs, and body feels a bit light, perception a bit skewed. Going to get up now and walk around to judge balance and general state.

Balance is fine. Feel a bit spacy but still well in control. I must have hit the mark pretty well judging the amount of powder. Foremost I would state that the potency of this drug must be respected. The rough trips I've read about have occured mostly at doses (and Intramuscular doses -- eek!) above 40mg, but then again I may be particularly sensitive to drugs of this type.I cite DXM as an example. Friends of mine have had little to no effect at 75-100mg, whereas 15-45mg is plenty for me to get a good buzz -- more than that gets disorienting and scary.

It's now been about 20min since I took the dose. It seems as though the effects have leveled off for the moment. I feel a bit warm (got cool AC on my back to counter this effect), and a mild DXM-like body-buzz . . . kind of like pins and needles and coldness all at the same time. Mind feels a bit quiet (I am usually a bit hyper/anxious), though I wouldn't exactly say I'm calm. Slightly odd taste in the mouth. Metallic? The dose was so small there was almost negligible drip, so I'm not sure if that's the taste of the drug, or simply my perception being altered. I do now notice that I completely forgot about a work issue that was stressing me out. Imagine that. Who knew NMDA receptors played a role in work related stress (just kidding).  All in all it's . . . ok.  A lot like DXM, less like K, but again, this was a very small dose. Several people reported euphoria, but I've felt pretty much felt average the whole time.  No sign of opiate-like 'warm-fuzzies' which several reports described, which disappointed me, but OH well.

Dose-response curves for this substance have been difficult to find and are not necessarily reliable. Don't know if I'll do any more tonight, as I have to get up early tomorrow, and I've also read the recovery time on this stuff can be extensive.

I caution anyone considering taking this drug to read as much as you can about this or any other research chemical before even thinking about trying it. I do not recommend it to anyone because it is risky behavior.  I trust myself and my own research, but never enough to risk anyone else's life.</bodytext></report>
