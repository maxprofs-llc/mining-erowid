I managed somehow to perform the 4-MMC (mephedrone) synthesis and bioassay the resulting product a couple of times. Since it's hard to tell anything that hasn't been already extensively covered by any of the hundreds of trip reports available over the internet, my most notable point is this: The product can be incredibly powerful, and the need to re-dose is very real! It's probably one of the most psychologically addictive substances I've ever tried (including anything from meth and crack to smoked heroin). The point is, the effects are there quite rapidly (when snorted) and fade off in a quite short period of time, ensuring a vicious re-dosing cycle quite similar to that of snorted cocaine.

The second more important point I've found is: beware of over-dosing! I haven't had any allergic reaction whatsoever (the doses never exceeded 250mg), but having been diagnosed with slight hypertension, I am concerned about the cold-handedness it readily produces. No other substance I've tested produces such a vasoconstriction (and resulting increased blood pressure), in such relatively small dosages.

So, my advice is to just use your brain. Research chemicals are never safe, and even less when dealing with stimulants.
