Bit of customary background.  I'm 28, and while I always thought of myself as an experienced tripper, I have today realized just how wrong I was.  All the club xtc, mushrooms, cannabis, lsd, and various other miscellaneous mind altering substances I have tried over many years were only hints of the experience of 2c-e.  That's the fairest way I can describe it.  But that's only if I use one sentence, and I think I can use several.  But first a word on setting and preparation.

I got 50mg of the stuff from an online source that I've never heard of before.  I had read tons about it and made up my mind that I liked it after, not before ordering it.  I ordered it on hunch, so to say, along with some 2C-I that I haven't received yet either.  That's kind of a clue of my mental set, a bit chaotic.  I'm a student of philosophy and psychology, and going through a bit of turmoil in life.  All this would affect the trip, just stuff to think about throughout, mixed feelings about where I am and where I'm going, bit of guilt and hope and regret.

I decided to do that trip with my good buddy J, who, although he's always been reluctant to go too heavy into any trip thus far, agreed to put his mental sanity in my hands this time without a second thought.  A leap of faith, so to say.  I took this as a good omen.

I did 2c-e on a school day, dosing while waiting for the bus on the way to school exactly 2.5 hours before class would start.  The plan was to be plateauing, past the come up with the read about nausea just as class was starting.  It worked like clockwork.

The comeup, lasting exactly 1 hour, was spent riding the bus to school.  First alert was a slight buzz and light visual tendencies that crept up slowly through the next half an hour to 45 minutes.  The 45 minutes after that we were both buzzing extremely nicely and deeply enjoying the visuals.  The next three hours were spent listening to a philosophy lecture on the ethics of homosexuality.  Deeply deeply entertaining, introspective, enlightening and truly psychedelic experience.

A note here on synaesthesia, not sure if this is spelled right, but I'm referring to the reported mixing of the senses.  That was there, but it was deeper than just a straightforward sense mix. It wasn't like I could just see the words.  I could do that, but ideas were also mixing with visuals, and things would get foggy if the ideas were unclear, or clear if the lecturer really had a hold of his audience.  There was a mix of more than just sense, but sense, feeling and thought and moment to moment attention, like I was aware of the focus of the entire lecture hall, with its lapses and moments of clarity.  I could see it.  Truly, truly psychedelic.

After the lecture, me and buddy J wandered around, ate(we hadn't eaten since the night before in preparation for the reported nausea, which did arise an hour and a half to two hours in, but was definitely not overwhelming, probably because of not eating), and mused about life and situations and girls and stuff.  I found the experience to be EXTREMELY introspective.  This is not a party drug, not something to get off on.  This is something to do and sit back and look at your life and see where you are, and think and look some more and always enjoy.

More overarching notes.  The body load was really comfortable, light and airy.  Hunger and slight tension was present at times but definitely not a bother.  The nausea went away right after the come up.  Most notable effects were the synaesthesia and the pronounced visuals that took a life of their own whenever I found time to just stand still and watch.  The trip was really manageable.  I was able to have a sober talk with my philosophy professor without, I think, giving him the impression that I was on something.  I could also move around without losing balance, and didn't feel like I was going to lose it at any point in time.

One thing that I did notice was a strong chemically smell present in the latter half of the trip, kind of like the smell of a freshly lit match.  J also reported that.  It came and went, and seemed to have a lot to do with the setting, and the perception of how artificial or chemical/electric/technological/polluted that setting was.  Probably just all in my head, but definitely worth noting because it was a fairly constant occurrence.

It is now t+9 hours, and I'm kind of on my way down.  The visuals have sort of died down, but have a way of creeping back in if I just take a moment and lie still.  It is not an unpleasant comedown.  My lower back is a little sore, but I've been sitting down alot lately, my jaw is relaxed.  There was very little need to clench or bite or do any of the club xtc like body-abuse I have grown to loathe.  So it's still a very very pleasant trip, and still really introspective.

A word on emotions and empathy.  I'm a fairly cold and analytic person myself, but my buddy J is more of an emotional kind of guy.  From what he told me, 2c-e accentuates that also.  So, overall, it kind of messes with everything; senses, thoughts, feelings, blends them all and clarifies them only to do it again in a never ending magic show of hide and seek, control and release, chaos and order, and moments.

I'll leave it off here, for now.  I don't know if I'm going to try this again and when.  There is a little higher dose waiting in my drawer for the right time and opportunity, but I think I will need a long time to, as others have put it, integrate the effects of this one.  I've said it before, but I will say it again, just for emphasis.  I thought that I knew my drugs before doing this thing, but now I know that I was only scratching at the surface.  This is TRULY psychedelic.  It showed me the meaning of psychedelic.  Definitely recommend it, again, not as an escape from reality and into pleasurable sensations, but with a strong desire to really go into reality and life and problems and solutions and experience and understand as much of it as possible.</bodytext></report>
