Earlier this year I was able to finally experience this drug for the first time. The story of getting the drug is rather relevant in some respects. A friend of mine had acquired the drug about 2 years earlier from an unknown source. He was pretty sure that the dose in the capsule was 25mg, but I had no way of verifying. It had sat in a closed(dark) container at room temperature in a capsule in a small sealed bag. Neither of us had any idea if it would be any good or if it would work at all.

Conveniently, right around this time I was left in my house all alone. 'PERFECT!', I thought, 'Now I can do this with no worries of intrusion.' I spent the day cleaning up around the house, making sure there was nothing to trip over, well stocked with cold water, black-light &amp; lava lamp setup, etc...

Around 1:00pm I then dumped half of the white powder out onto a mirror. I had read about the horrible pain that most reported from snorting 2C-T-7, but I wanted to get the most out of this that I could since I didn't believe I would ever see this substance again. I snorted the first half and waited for the pain. I didn't notice much of anything pain-wise, but I certainly noticed an almost immediate feeling of rising through the levels of consciousness.

I decided that it wasn't that bad &amp; immediately poured the rest of the powder out on the mirror &amp; snorted it. The increase in the pain was very noticeable, but not nearly as bad as I expected. I've experienced much worse nasal burns from methamphetamine. Perhaps this has something to do with it sitting around (curing?) for two years?

I had rolled 2 joints previous to ingesting the 2C-T-7. [Note: I refrained from consuming any marijuana earlier this day because I wanted to feel the true effects of the 2C-T-7.] After I finished off the powder I lit the first joint. By the time it was half way done I was in outer-space and I put it out. I don't think this had much to do with the weed, but more to do with the 2C-T-7.

The effects came on incredibly quickly, but I kept going up for the next few hours. This fact continued to trip me out throughout the 'coming up' portion of the trip. I had never snorted anything that I could feel still kicking in more than 45 minutes later. The time-line of the whole experience is a little off because I didn't look at the time at all. I was completely mind-blown for about the next 8-10 hours though. All I did for the most part was lay around in bed (the body load IS very high and I didn't feel like moving much). I spent much time staring out my window at my backyard. It was very peaceful looking out at the grass &amp; trees &amp; sunlight.

One of the most interesting effects of the drug was that I would forget what drug I was on. Sometimes I would think of myself as rolling (on MDMA), or I would be intensely reminded of LSD, and sometimes it was mushrooms. The best way that I can explain it is that it felt like MDMA (everything has a pleasant &amp; very vivid texture), looked like LSD (the visual distortions and patterns reminded me very much of acid), and it thought like mushrooms (the wandering, pondering, meandering, adventure that they can lead you on). Now, I know that these effects aren't just described to the drugs that I've given examples for... but this is the exact thought I had when I was tripping on 2C-T-7.

Throughout the experience I smoked quite a bit of weed from a bong &amp; the rest of the joints I had rolled previously (rolling a new one was well beyond me for almost the entire time). The effects of the marijuana seemed rather negligable but I'm sure they took some edge off the trip and added to the experience. Around midnight or 1am I finally got hungry and (amazingly enough) I managed to cook a massload of chicken nuggets.

Now, usually when I trip on any substance once I eat I come down and the trip is no longer as intense at all. This was not the case this time around. I continued to peak until about 5 or 8am and around 10 I believe I was finally able to fall asleep.

I wish I could get more of this substance. It is possibly the best drug I have ever ingested. I'm not sure what the 2 year wait did to the drug, and if any chemists out there have any ideas I'd be glad to hear them. 2C-T-7 was an incredible experience that I will never forget and always treasure. Thinking back on it now, months later, I realize that I remember more from that trip than from when I usually trip on other substances (LSD,MDMA,shrooms). I've never done mescaline so I can't do any kind of comparison there, but I hear it has similar effects.</bodytext></report>
