Wow - well, I was having trouble sleeping and was prescribed Ambien.  I took a 10mg pill on an empty stomach and felt the onset in literally like 10-15 minutes!  The first few times I took it and layed in bed and slept.  However, I then took 10mg and decided to force myself to stay awake and oh my god is it fun!  I just felt completely tripped out and didn't remember anything the next day!  It definitely feels like taking like 2mg of Xanax, but then smoking weed with it or something.  It's definitely a really weird, but good feeling.</bodytext></report>
