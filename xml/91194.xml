Needed a fix. Raided Parents Medicine Cabinet. They asked 'What you looking for?', I said 'Pain Killers'.  They started to look through the cabinet for me and I saw a prescription bottle and asked 'What's that?' My Mom said 'Nothing' with a horrified look on her face as she read the label, like she was recalling bad memories. 'Flush these down the toilet' I grabbed them and took them to the bathroom then I opened the bottle and put the pills in my pocket and flushed the toilet.

2:30 pm After waking up several times and going back to sleep I finally decide to get up. I had some R.E.M. sleep, but I still feel very out of it. I wanted a fix even more now. Unpleasant.</bodytext></report>
