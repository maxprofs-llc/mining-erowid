So I finally got to try this new compound MDAI. I knew it was developed by Nichols in the 90's and that it appeared to be non-neurotoxic in rats (Nonneurotoxic tetralin and indan analogues of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine (MDA), 1990, among others...).

I have tried many different drugs in the past, some of which I regret. I shall only mention those I use exclusively as of today, and these are tryptamines and phenethylamines. Find below those I tried:
/n
/n
Tryptamines: LSA (Many, many trips on HBWR seeds, by the time I had no access to any reliable acid supplier), LSD (one to two trips every 10 to 20 days), psilocybin mushrooms (cubensis, once, looking forward to trying again), 5-MeO-DALT (RC). Soon: DMT. Non-directly-active, misc: 5-HTP, L-tryptophan, and so forth...
/n
Phenethylamines: MDMA, Mescaline cactus, Methylone (mostly), 2-CI.
/n
/n
I would like to point out that my average satisfying doses of Methylone (300 mg) and MDMA (225 mg) are apparently higher than those of other people. We will see that I react the same way with MDAI.
/n

I ordered 1 g of that brownish MDAI powder from an online supplier. I hadn't done any Methylone or MDMA since last winter (it is now the beginning of summer) because I started to suffer from very annoying and depressing back-ends. I was therefore a bit anxious about a back-end, and in the same time confident because of Nichols' paper.
/n
/n
I dosed 100 mg at T=0, and waited two hours. The taste is horrible. Not as much as MDMA, but it has this typical chemical after-taste, probably that of the solvent, eewww! At T0 + 2h I was very disappointed. Nothing seemed to do any effect that could not be placebo. I had had a mediocre night sleep before and was somewhat still sleepy when I dosed. I hoped this would awaken me, as would have methylone. Major mistake! 
/n
/n
As I laid down on my bed, I fell into a light sleep with persistant hypnagogic thoughts, but no visuals or hallucination, as on the come-down from methylone. I listened to some music (Clint Mansell), which sounded slightly improved (placebo?).
/n
/n
At T0 + 2h, a bit frustrated, I redosed 200 mg. After 1h (T0 + 3h) I started to feel a tingling sensation all over my skin and maybe some numbness. Not at all annoying, but not sincerely pleasant either. I suddenly started to feel a very peculiar empathogenic effect. Peculiar in this that it felt really natural and non-induced. I doubt it was placebo because when I decided to call a relative, I found myself being very talkative (at least, more than usually and sober). I was still sleepy so I laid down and took a short nap. This is the main point of divergence from MDMA: Don't hope taking MDAI and stay awake all night, it's probably not adrenergic enough. The tingling sensation was going up my neck along my spine. I was feeling very calm.
/n
/n
I was awaken by a phone call from my girlfriend. I'm was bit groggy but her voice made me happy. I was feeling so much love at that moment.
/n
/n
It's T0 + 6h. I decided that my ideal dose is 300 mg. I redosed half of what was remaining. That is roughly 350 mg (I took tolerance into account). I also had a cup of tea. After 90 minutes to 2h (T0 + 8h), things began to get very interesting. First, the apartment was looking strangely alien, *too* white and with a lot of space. My mind started to feel very very good! Almost no MDMA-like physical effect, and there was not going to be any. This is a very cerebral drug apparently. 
/n
/n
Music sounded fantastic. I wanted to dance a little bit. I felt very happy. I decided to go outside for a bicycle ride. Then I had the strangest idea and decided to go swimming in the lake (it was about midnight, but we still have a nice natural luminosity here). I climbed over the fence of a private park that usually closes at 22 and go naked into the water. Apparently I was not the only one, but the other people here (who climbed too) were leaving, probably looking for more privacy. We saluted each other. Still a lot of empathy around. I swam entirely across the lake and back. The water on my skin was cold, but it felt really really good. I would like to point out that I usually never get to the other side, and I was also particularly fast on the bike. I've felt the same way on 2-CI or LSD before.  I don't think these compounds are performance-enhancers per se, but I think the state of happiness you are in makes you more enthusiast in the pursuit of physical performances.
/n
/n
At T0 + 12, I still had an afterglow and went to bed satisfied and slept well.
/n
/n
At no point I have felt any back-end, or been depressed (maybe just some frustration for my first too-low doses).
/n
/n
CONCLUSION: As I suspected, I need a minimum satisfying dose of 300 mg. MDAI has some of the (mainly empathogenic) advantages of MDMA or Methylone (however, trip is much longer than Methylone), with no rush, though. It has absolutely *none* of MDMA's drawbacks :) (back-end depression, sleeplessness, etc.) I am therefore tempted to hypothesize that it may not be neurotoxic in people either. The trip is more cerebral than physical, and I doubt it is a suitable drug for partying (I would probably not go through the night fully awake).

It is a nice compound, and I think I will do it again in the future.</bodytext></report>
