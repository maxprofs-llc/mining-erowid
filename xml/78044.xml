I have two friends, 'Andy' and 'Bob,' who used to take between three and six times as much (respectively) of any substance as me to get to the same level, and they still had a much flatter peak. We are all about the same size and weight, and lead similar life-styles.

One day we were all going to partake in an ayahuasca experience. A double dose of /n (just to be sure) and 30 mg DMT each. Bob got a few rushes and other physical sensations, but very little visually. Andy and I had the most amazing and scary time of our lives. (This was about a year ago.) Since then we have tried many other substances in minute quantities--like half a tablet of MDMA, LSD, mushrooms, etc.--but always with our MAO fully inhibited. For the time the MAO is inhibited, we have equal amounts of the substance to give each one of us equal effects. Even Bob is now on the same drug dosage; his problem was that even the double /n dose was not enough. We now use Moclobemide, which is much gentler on the stomach, and easier to dose accurately. /n with MAO fully inhibited, one MDMA tablet equals about 8-10. It's worth mentioning that the comedown is equivalent to slightly more than the actual amount of drug taken, not equivalent to a comedown that would be expected from the experienced effects. -- Distorted, Australia
