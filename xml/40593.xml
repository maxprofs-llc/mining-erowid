Tried the powdered leaves; took approx. 5g mixed with hot chai tea which makes a good mixer. Powder doesn't completely dissolve so I get a little powder mouth, and have to rinse the sides of my cup with water to get it all, but it's easy to drink. I dosed at approx. 7pm about a 1/2 hour after doing 38 minutes of fairly intense cardiovascular exercise, which typically enhances all chemical &amp; herbal experiences, and also assists with a clean exit of substances from my system. Took about 45-60 minutes for 1st effect, which is about my typical time to metabolize prescription narcotics, and effects were similar to the aforementioned stuff.

I agree about potential analgesic application, and it really seems a close cousin to vicodin. In fact this herb could possibly serve as a replacement for narcotics, and may be safer and easier on the system, although generic narcotics are cheaper than kratom if I break it down by $ per dose. True, the abuse potential is there, but in moderation kratom seems to create a pleasant, mellow, happy effect, like laying in a field of poppies.......</bodytext></report>
