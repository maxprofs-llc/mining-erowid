I am experienced in the realms of heavy usage. Many lsd experiments at 600-1000 ug's, shrooms at 1.5-6 grams, Even the use of high dose DXM, but nothing prepared me for this.  I've read of  certain preparations that could encourage one to do something stupid. I'd like to set the records straight by saying that a rapid intake of 2.5-5 grams of rue, over a period of two hours, will facilitate what I want out of my viridis.  Unless I mess up by using some bad viridis, I cant see how I can go wrong with the goal of attaining an insane and intense trip.

I had approx. 3 grams rue the first day over a period of 4 hours.  Then I had a sip of viridis.   I then went to type a paper at the college about the movie 'requiem for a dream' for a psych. class.  I was almost finished when forty minutes after this gradual ingestion, (after Rue ingestion), my thoughts were moving quite rapidly and then an obviously visual component arrived due to the single .5 gram viridis-tea-sip I had drank 30 min. after the rue, prior to going to school.  This was very interesting to me.  The rue seemed to have an anesthetic effect that was provided perhaps by the dissociating tactile hallucinations that made me feel as high or bodyless as ever. So I finished my paper, printed it and tripped my way out of the building.  I then arrived at my abode and had another 6-8 grams worth of viridis.  /n  This according to most studies is about 12-18 mgs of DMT, just short of the average visionary dosage. I guess I was lucky when obtaining my viridis because..................  /n

After about 6 grams of viridis, I was totally finished.  My Ego was resistant, and I went outside for a walk to deal with the intensity.  This however only lasted for about 20 min.  Then a sort of a flatline occurred within the 2 hours after the trip.  It became obvious to me that although 3 grams of RUE (ingested over time), was present in my system, it was perpetually waning and struggling to hold on to the effects of the viridis. so I had another sip of the viridis for scientific purposes only.  This perpetuated me within one hour into the realm I had desired all night.  It was very much like mushrooms with a stunning hint of familiarity/light and depth to the visions.  The visions abide by our interpretation of reality and this is what made them more involved than any other. The visuals got more intense as the night wore on, yet I still knew it could have been far more interesting with the same consituents and a more regimented maoi dosage.  I fell asleep later and felt that I had broken the rules, and denied their eeffect.

DAY 2
/n
I had 2 grams Rue over a period of 1.5 hour after work, and then perpetually by .1 grams added to the dosage until I had about 2.8 grams in me of viridis. I mistakenly used leftoveres which had been steeped for over 20 hours +  More viridis low-boiled for apprx. 2 more hours and then steeped for a few. SO I got the most out of about 18 grams in one night (I had no grounds by which to understand the implications of these dosages).

This was as intense as 3.5-5 grams of mushrooms, but with a stunning complexity to the visions that in fact last far longer than mushrooms because of their depth and there level of integration with the psyche. This dose was coupled with the mao-inhibition of the night before, this is actually why it was soooooooooooo intense. Maoi's are the spirit of this concoction, and if used incorrectly one could find themselves with a minor Rue trip, hypertension, only a slight DMT infuence, or a favorably DMT-soaked rollercoaster. In this case I experienced the latter, because of my body's suceptibility to MAOI's, and the gradual dosage of RUE over a period of 2 days. Within one hour of my consumption of this viridis I became extremely nervous, as if I had taken more shrooms than were possible for my tolerance level.  A giant ooppppsssssss.... coarsed through my consciousnesss. Then the un-moved mover seemed to take control.  I lived through this madness with the help of an entity that fused time with causal happenings as it pertained to my cognition.  Everything was enveloped in the matrix of chaos as it roped around the finite form of the spiral.

The voids of cognition then became apparent to me, and every one was synchronistically filled, as disturbing as it might have been, I knew my course of action, and I followed 'IT'.  It without language, without body, destroyed me, and left me with 4 days of recovery to get my vision back to normal. It was sooooooooooooooo worth it, although I could have cried for days at the mere sight/sound/smell/tactile of the real world.</bodytext></report>
