The primary materials I use are: the tin exterior of a tea lite candle, and a rock.

1. Over a lit candle, I put one anadenanthera seed in the tea lite tin. I hold this tin with pliers.

2.  I wait for that seed to either expand in size, or pop and then put it off to the side.

3. Repeat for as many seeds as needed.

4. After getting 3-4 expanded seeds, I carefully remove the outer shell.

5.  The inside should still be a yellow or off white color. I grind the yellow seeds up, until they are a fine powder.

6. Enjoy my Yopo.

With 1-2 seeds, I use it much like the Yanomamo tribe at times of hunting, as a stimulant.  One or two seeds is just enough to get me going for a short period of time, and also puts me at ease.  For me, it is like a calm jolt of energy.</bodytext></report>
