Throught the past year and  half I've tried a variaty of different mind altering drugs. And one of the most eyecatching drugs was nitrous. Well last Saturday my friends( M and T ) and I wanted to try a drug that wasn't going to keep us up alnight, and thus nitrous was going to be the drug of choice. However none of us had any  nor could we gain acess to any nitrous, so we decied to go to the local Wal-Mart and buy a few 16inch ballons, and a can of this inhalant that all 3 of us have been hearing about. This was a can of Duster. So we bought the Duster and went to my house for a night of fun.

We were all unsure of what the effects of the Duster would do, but the only way to find out was to do it. So T filled a ballon with the Duster and started to inhale and and exhale into the ballon, he did so for about 10 or 12 times until he let go of the ballon and fell back onto my bed while he laughed uncontrolably. After about 30 seconds he was fine again and told me that 'I had to try it!'. So T filled up a ballon for me. I inhaled the Duster which tasted nasty at first but after the first inhale I didn't notice, I held my nose while I was breathing, just to see if it would help, I did so untill I couldn't anymore, and then the fun began. I became extremly light headed and i heard a loud WA WA WA WA sound. I laid back on my bed and exhaled for the final time, and when I did I saw a cloud of little moucles coming out of my mouth and laughing at me and calling me stupid for trying the Duster.

After about 30 to 45 seconds the effects faded away as quickly as they came. T then filled a ballon for M, M then took about 8 or 10 hits from the ballon untill he started to laugh and tell us about how he thought he had a small head. If you are looking for a drug that doesn't last long and is very fun while it lasts then Duster could be for you. But please BE CAREFUL.  It can be VERY dangerous.</bodytext></report>
