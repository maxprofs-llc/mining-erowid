HISTORY:
/n
The following report is a recollection of my fifth time experimenting with 'shrooms' (and the most mind-blowing experience might I add).  I have never been big into drugs.  I am particularly into psychedelics and expanding my mind, knowledge, wisdom, and experiences.  That is my reasoning for experimenting with this fungus.  I am the type of person who likes to try everything once, and do it wisely... but 'shrooms' have really made an impact on my outlook on life.  I did research on anything and everything about P. cubensis mushrooms before trying it.  I have always been very careful to make sure that I am comfortable and prepared for the experience.  However, this one caught me by surprise.  I had not planned on doing it until about one hour before I actually ate them.

SETTING:
/n
I am with three friends of mine (J, Z, and M, S enters later) none of whom I am close to.  We are at my friends new house which is completely empty of furniture and people so we decided to trip there.

THE TRIP:
/n
We all ate them at the same time and consumed the same dosage (1/8 of an ounce).  The taste is something I have never enjoyed.  I was sitting on the floor and it hit me almost instantly faster than it usually does.  I felt drunk, swaying forward and backward, and began laughing along with J.  He was moving all over the room and talking which I found a little strange.  From my experience, I feel it is difficult to move because my whole body feels weak.  I try to refrain from speaking because I know that I dont make sense and feel stupid when I do.  This may be my own paranoia, though.  J was very entertaining to me for the rest of the night, and made me laugh a lot.  My abs are still sore.  Somehow, I felt comfortable tripping around these people so I talked a lot more.  We plugged in a movie, made ourselves comfortable, and watched it until it really kicked in.  Eventually we all got bored and the others decided to take a little journey through the backyard.  I was getting numerous phone calls so I decided to stay inside.  I was very surprised that I was able to hold a conversation with somebody sober.  This is something I have not been able to do in my past shroom experiences.

Soon enough, they came back inside satisfied with their journey and we all had a few laughs.  My vision was distorted, the most distorted it has been compared to all of my trips.  There were colorful waves moving through the walls and pretty much everything I saw.  The floor was moving in parallel layers, each layer moving differently.  I was cold for the rest of the night and time moved very slowly.  I had very poor depth perception, balance, and coordination.  These things didnt bother me too much though, because I spent the majority of the night sitting down.  I had a period of about 5 minutes, which felt like 2 hours, where I was realizing and analyzing everything I was experiencing, as well as comparing them to my other trips.  I felt disconnected from reality, lost in my own mind.

I finally snapped back into reality and I saw that J had found a garbage bag and thought it would be fun to get inside of it.  With much struggle, he had managed to get lost inside it and couldnt find his way out.  I found this very amusing, as did the others.  I found it very difficult to hold back laughter.  I felt as if I was in some sort of circus or zoo with all of us running around laughing uncontrollably.  All I can really remember thinking is how much fun I was having and repeating it over and over in my head.  We all decided it would be fun to go for a ride in my car.  None of us were willing to drive (fortunately), so we called up a sober friend.  S agreed to drive us around because he needed some entertainment.
/n
/n
So S comes over and we take my car around town.  I feel lost, disoriented, and confused whenever I actually have to do something.  Any simple responsibilities we had for the rest of the night, such as going to the bathroom, walking, finding something, etc., became known to us as our burdens.  We had several words and phrases throughout the night that only us four understood.  I usually experience this sort of connection with others while I am tripping.  I felt very connected to them in many ways, and still do because of the experience.  
/n

We decided we would just drive around and behold (another word we used) everything there was to see.  I felt as if I was in a boat, a racecar, and a spaceship and different points during the night.  It seemed as if the car was still, but everything around us was moving.  The street was moving very fast, and in layers.  The trees were overwhelming and were everywhere.  They were growing and moving abnormally.  I felt as if they were beings watching me and what I was doing.  The phrase they know kept repeating over and over in my head.  Everything seemed to blossom.  The others in the car were talking but I didnt pay attention or take the effort to try decipher what they were saying, because I knew it was pointless.  I just wanted to get lost in my own thoughts.  Everything around me was so overwhelming.  I had the feeling that there was so much going on around me and I couldnt absorb it all.  Everything I would behold for the rest of the night seemed to simply just make sense.  Everything made sense in a way I had never experienced before.  I felt like everything in the world was its own puzzle piece and all of the little pieces came together and fit perfectly.  Everything was everything.  Nothing was nothing.  Everything was the same.

The most disturbing burden I had throughout the night was seeing other people, especially people I didnt know.  We wanted to get away from everybody so we went to a place that fellow trippers in my area call mushroom mountain.  It isnt a mountain, but more of a big pile of dirt.  It had rained earlier that day, so it was very muddy.  We parked and all walked up the hill.  My distorted depth perception and vision was really kicking in now that we were outside.  We were walking together but it seemed like they were all very far from me.  I began to feel like I was in a movie, a play, or a painting.  I couldnt decide which one it was most like, more like a blend of the three.  It was dark outside and the sunset made an orange glow in the background.  I could see beings which I made out to be J, Z, M, and S walking in a straight line across the hill to the right of me.  They were moving very slowly with their heads down at least that is what my mind perceived.  I was very confused at this point because a second ago they were all right next to me.  I felt like something was controlling them and for some reason we were all about to be in trouble.  I do not know where this feeling came from.  Then I snapped out of it and they were all sucked back to where I was.  I had lost touch with reality again for a brief moment.  
/n
/n
We continued walking and sat at the top of the hill silent for what seemed like hours.  It never got boring.  We all sat there and thought.  I felt as if our thoughts were all in unison.  I was thinking what they were thinking.  I was feeling what they were feeling.  Eventually we walked back to the car.  We were all coming down from the trip on the ride back to Zs house.  The trip lasted for about 5 hours, which was one of the shortest trips I have had.  It started, proceeded, and ended very gracefully.  I was ready for it to be over and I had not experienced anything too overwhelming.  This was a glowing experience.

I apologize for the lack of clear explanations of my trip, but this is beyond words.  There are no words that will ever do justice to a mushroom experience, at least that is my opinion.  No two trips I have had were ever the same, or even remotely similar.  That is why they never get boring to me.  I am always anxious to see what the next bag of fungus has in store for me.  I dont mean to put a drug up on a pedestal, but in my opinion it is one of the safer drugs to do.  For now, I would have to say shrooms are my drug of choice.</bodytext></report>
