It was about 7:00 pm at night I had my alarm set to 6:30 AM, and three bottles of robotussin by the side of my bed. I woke at 6:30 AM and down the nasty taste of robotussin. At about 6:40 AM I had them all downed, Then I smoked about a gram of hydro so I wouldn't feel very nauseous. At 7:00 I was done and very very high.

At this time I had to get ready for school. I showered and all other things, grabed a bunch of food and left. I had done lots of corisidon and thought this wouldn't be much different or any more powerful, accidentally I had mixed up on dose amount, I was used to taking like 300 ml, 10 corrisidon, but then I learned that, that was not a very safe way to do it. When the bus showed up at 7:20 I was starting to feel it a little. I felt like my soul was being sucked from the top of my head, and things stopped seeming real somewhat. It kicked in very very fast I wasnt used to that.

I had my classes planed out so I would be on it at a later time because corrisidon takes three hours to kick in for me. That wouldnt matter I thought. At about 7:40 I got to my school at this time those feelings I was already having just got more intense and noticable. Time started to go by pretty quickly when I got to school. I stayed at the same level of extremity for all of Spanish, that ended at about 8:30.

After that I went to my next class English. In the begining I started to feel it alot. Everyone around didn't seem real. My body felt like it had seperated into three parts. I felt very very short. The ground got really close to me. At 9:00 I went to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and every time I looked in it I cryed really hard every time for some reason. My eyes look very very fucked up red and small but big big pupils.

All of a sudden at 9:30 I felt five parts in my body just start to like feel painfully tingley and just overwhelming. All of the sudden I felt like 'Oh shit!' I through up across the room. I forget most of this so I'll try to explain it. My friends told me things that I was doing so, I have that piece of info. Aparently I lost all of my color I was grey and really really cold, and puking hard. my teacher when I became somewhat consious again was holding my head into the trash bucket and I was coverd in sweat. I then blacked out again and the next time I woke I was in the nurses office feeling much better from puking but still getting higher, my body was comletly numb, It was 10:15.

I got driven home. When I was home I balanced myself down to my room. It was 10:40 at this time. When I got into my room my wall was like intimidating me. I was yelling at it and finally it was doing it so bad that I punched a big hole in it. Then I threw like 20 more punches at it and we fought until I had pretty much ruined the wall completly. I was interupted by sounds I heard, something was calling me. 11:00, I turned around and looked at my bed. A stuffed animal on my bed was talking to me but its mouth wasn't moving so I knew it was the stuffed animal. It was telling me that I wasn't going to make it and I was a waste of life anyways.

At 11:20 I felt a surge of energy and the bear stopped talking. My wall all of a sudden started to cave in and out. I thought damn it I am going to die. I was almost sure I wasn't going to make it, but I didn't care. Nothing seemed to matter at all. When I thought about my girlfriend she seemed very unimportant and like I didn't really know her that well and she just didn't matter. Then I thought fuck it then if I die oh well I don't give a fucking shit. I felt like I was dead already.

At about 12:00 my whole room started to shake but I couldn't feel it. At this point I just couldn't handle it anymore it was way to intense so I went to sleep. I had trouble having my body being very numb but I managed to fall asleep. I had dreams about me doing DXM and they all seemed more real than reality it was fucked. When I awoke at 11 am the next day I felt appreciative of everything and just great. I wanted to succeed in life. I was really really happy and I sat down and worked hard on school work and things like that. Before I would never do that at home because I couldn't handle it. Everything was just perfect.

My parents noticed the change and so did the school. Another thing that I feel now that I didn't before is, I feel like everything has a spirit. Dxm pulled me so far away from reality that it must mean that my wall and stuffed animals must have one. I was on a level where I could understand that. I don't think that I will ever do that much again, it is just painful and unpleasant.</bodytext></report>
