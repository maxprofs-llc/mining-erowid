I had a lot of physical side effects once getting on the drug. After being on it worked up to 200 mg over almost a year period. I'm not sure if it did anything for me b/c still experienced a lot of the anxiety and disturbed sleeping. I was prescribed it for anxiety. I take klonopin now and they help. I am in the process of switching to Effexor b/c I really haven't noticed that much of a change since getting on the zoloft. It affects everyone differently. I did not gain weight either as many people mentioned.</bodytext></report>
