1st experience:
/n
/n
I came across this stuff which was described to me as 'Doggy K'  The person selling it to us had gotten it from a friend who had worked in a animal hospital. 
/n
/n
We figured why not try it? It was being offered at a cheaper price and there was no Ketamine to be found.
/n
/n
I remember it was in a bottle but there was no liquid inside just a large white (or could have been yellowish) rock inside the bottle..after breaking it up a little into a  chunky powder it seemed that the more I cut it up the more it turned sticky and began to clump more, so we left it at that and put some small lines out to test.
/n
/n
I remember snorting a little and when it first kicked in it felt good, almost like an onset of Ecstacy but nothing more, though it felt nice, my aim was to go into a K Hole so I put out another line and snorted it. After this I do not remeber ANYTHING...nothing at all
/n
/n
After it was all over, My friends who had stayed sober were telling me that I was being very noisy, I was jumping off the couch thinking I was a bird, I was also going up to my friend and telling him in a robotic voice that I was a robot, I also repeatedly approached him every 5 minutes saying 'hey whats up Bob I didnt know you were here, when did you get here.?....
/n
/n
Again, I Do Not Remember any of this.

2nd experience:
/n
/n
That fact that i had a Total Blackout of the night really bothered me. i was determined to remeber what the experience was like. so i got some more and a few nights later I tryed it in my room.
/n
I woke up the next day With absolutley no recolection of the night..
/n
I didnt think it was a drug worth persuing anymore so i got rid of it.
/n
---------------------
/n
Looking it up on the internet it seems people use this drug.
/n
I wonder why?
/n
Maybe i just did to much?
/n
Maybe it is meant to be used in very small doses.?
/n
From what my friends told me of the night..the experience seems to be more closely related to an Angel Dust high then it is to the Ketamine experience.
/n
/n
I dont think i will ever try Telazol again.
