My interest in marijuana was peeked at a late age.  As all my friends were getting into it as early as grade 7 and 8, I didn't touch it till late grade 9.  I immediately thought the effects were interesting and continued using about a couple of times a month throughout the remaining school year.  The odd thing was though, after that first time, the effects seemed much less obvious whenever I smoked since that first time in December but I kept smoking anyway enjoying the head buzz it gave me.  I thought it was odd that it didn't effect me like all my friends and I could smoke 3 joints in a row and be perfectly clear headed. This continued from December until June, I would smoke marijuana a few times a month feeling nothing but a buzz.

Then one day in June, I was smoking a joint at my friends house when I finally felt 'high'.  I got sensations like I was floating and felt really different, reminding me of the first time I smoked. After these effects came to me, I started smoking bud a lot more often from June to the summer.  During these few months I started smoking pretty casually and quite often.

When the school year started in September, I would as usual partake in any casual smoking with the effects never vanishing mysteriously like they did before.  Then in October, I started experimenting with cocaine.  One thing led to another and I had used ecstacy, magic mushrooms and salvia soon after that.  I had no motivation to start using anything harder and just decided to mess around with those few drugs.  After using cocaine for a few weeks, I soon grew tired of the over-rated effects and cherished the high weed gave me.  I started smoking a few days a week, a little more often during the week.

Then, something wierd happened.  One night, me and my friend were smoking bud out of a billy.  A small metal tube bought from a store inserted into a water bottle.  We slowly pull the smoke into the bottle and through some water and release it all into our lungs at once.  This provides my lungs with a huge amount of cooled smoked all at once.  The type of high I get from this method of smoking is considerably different than smoking a joint.  It is much more intense in a smaller span of time.  Well I took two of the largest hits I've ever seen anyone take in a billy and this was my first time ever hitting one properly, taking in all the smoke at once and finishing everything in the bowl in one hit.  What followed was the most horrific experience of my life.

I was launched into this state where my heart was beating the fastest I've ever heard and I thought I was going to black out any minute.  My friend tried to calm me down but I was almost hallucinating and it seemed like he was bouncing around the room and looked like a mouse.  When I looked towards my tv, it suddenly felt everything was rushing at me at 100 miles an hour.  I also had a really bad ringing in my ears.  It was one of the scariest experience I've ever had and severely scared the shit out of me from smoking.  I proceeded to vomit and eventually felt better but still apprehensive about bud now.

A few days after that experience, one day after school I decided to smoke just to see if the same thing would happen but was too nervous to hit it out of the bill since I thought that was the problem.  So I made a makeshift pipe and had the same effects except VERY mildly.  So mild that the experience was still enjoyable and I could ride it out without freaking out.

Slowly, I started smoking several times a day, up to 4 or 5, every day for a couple of months.  The frightening experiences slowly vanished.  I would smoke in the morning, at lunches, after school and at night.  I started to realise I was always burned out, tired and just wanting to sleep after being high and decided it wasn't fun to just abuse something like that.  I would sometimes go one or two days without smoking just to see if I could do it but would quickly go back.

Now, for the past month or two, I smoke just about daily, all the time before I go to bed.  I find it enjoyable to be able to relax and listen to some music, watch some tv or do whatever and it doesn't bother me being high alone all the time on weekdays like it does to most people.  I've noticed in the past few days my highs have become very mild, often I only feel high for about 5 minutes then totally clearheaded.  I've decided to cut back for a week or so to see if the effects come back.

All in all, a very complicated and rocky relationship with weed.</bodytext></report>
