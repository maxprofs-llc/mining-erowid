I tried smoking valerian root pills (90mg extract, .8% valerenic acid) today through a bong. Had about 4 or 5 pills/bowls in a 6 hour time span. Would define it as a very mild high, much like skunk weed, but more relaxing than compared to the stoned high. Smoking it is much more pronounced than oral administration. I don't get tired from valerian at all, which is one of its main uses. I use it more as an anti-anxiety, than a sedative, probably since I take benadril regularly to induce sleep. It's kinda harsh but bearable in a 'water pipe.' High lasts about 5-15 minutes, any kind of weed is definantly more potent than valerian root but if I have no access to weed this is a legal alternative. Not great but it's something.</bodytext></report>
