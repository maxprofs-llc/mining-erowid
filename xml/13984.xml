I had been taking penicillin V for several days before I dosed.  To be careful, I looked up all known contraindictions that penicillin had with other substances and it looked safe--no bad combos known.  As another precaution, I measured out a little less than a common dose of AMT, knowing my sensitivity to the tryptamines and because I'd not yet tried this entheogen.

I decided to try AMT at a great party in the middle of nowhere, just a few trees in a desert-like region.  My boyfriend B and I set up our tent and lounged about for the rest of the afternoon.  As the evening wore on, B and I ate some rice pudding, grapes, bread, and various snack foods for dinner.  At 7:30, I steeped 2g of Blue Lotus 5X powdered extract in a cup of boiling water for 30 minutes and downed it--quite an unpleasant taste, like mushroom tea.  After I finished, he easily convinced me to a fun romp on the bedrolls.

For our health, we each took 1000mg of vitamin C and 300mg of alpha lipoic acid.  We dosed our premeasured caps, 27mg AMT for me, 60mg AMT for him (he's a hardhead) at around 8:15 and headed to the bathroom.  While waiting for him to finish, I found some friends outside passing around a pipe and took a few tokes, hoping to forestall any possible nausea.  When we got back to the tent, we decided to stock up on some shut-eye, knowing we wouldn't be able to sleep for several hours after the AMT kicked in.

Eventually, we entered a light drowse, waking up fully at about 10:30pm.  First alerts began with yawning.  I had been trying to ignore a slight nausea, believing the problem to be more nervousness than a true side effect, but by 11:00, I knew I was going to vomit soon.  Hoping to avoid this, we sought out the same friends again, thinking some pot should settle my stomach.  By this time, we were definitely tripping--colorful melting visuals and quite an extended time walking to the seemingly distant dance floor.

Two more tokes and the pot seemed to help a bit, but we headed for the bathroom just in case.  Arriving there, I realized I couldn't hold it down anymore and heaved out a small amount of our dinner as sacrifice to the porcelain god.  It helped a little, but not much; I still felt a knot of pain deep in my solar plexus.

Realizing I was in no shape for dancing, we crawled back into the tent to wait it out.  On the way there, we compared visuals and mental states, happily concluding equal trip intensity (this had not yet happened between us.)

Lying down in the tent, I felt guilty, feeling like I was holding him back from dancing at this perfectly situated party.  I also started feeling guilty about other times I didn't make things easy for him, pushing the limits of his generosity and patience.  I also was NOT happy with AMT's body load, and wished for his comforting company.  All these conflicting feelings jostled inside me until I started crying and apologizing for all problems I seemed to cause him.  As I let my emotions tumble out, the painful knot in my middle loosened and the nausea drifted away; I realized those pains had been psychosomatic in nature, and the hard knot was actually my heart chakra, all wound up and barricaded.  For several hours, I let down those walls, sobbing against his shoulder and finding the deep roots to my pain and guilt.

As the last demons found their way out, we felt closer than ever, the problems in our relationship finally understood and appreciated.  His comforting touch transformed into caresses and every caress sent delicious shivers through my body.  When I touched him in return, I noticed his own similar reactions.  The buzzing in our limbs, unpleasant during our earlier ordeal, now settled into a sensuality fit to explore.  For another hour or two, we encouraged a steady escalation, finding AMT to be very similar to Foxy, although not as visual or sexual.  However, I couldn't seem to concentrate on our sexual energies for extended periods, and we soon gave up on a reaching a more satisfying culmination.

At the same time, my body tempurature was rising steadily, and my jaw and limbs started chattering and twitching.  I remember less at this point.  B and I believe this was about 2am, T+5:00ish.  B's recollection follows:

The temperature was roughly 50 degrees outside our tent and she started overheating severely.  Jaw Clench, nyastigmus, muscle weakeness, incoordination, and body spasms were all present.  I figured that her temp rose so high she was cooking and at this point I got really concerned.  She kept complaining about how cold she was but her core temperature was way to hot.  She wanted to wrap herself up in a sleeping bag but I thought that she might overheat and die so I made sure she stayed cold and drank lots cold water with potassium and sodium in it to stay hydrated.  My anxiety peaked when she said she was having trouble breathing, so I told her to take long slow deep breaths and stay calm.  After a few minutes her temp stayed up there but her breathing became regular again.  Thoughout this whole night we were consuming alpha-lipoic acid, an anti-oxidant found to almost completely prevent free radical damage from mdma in rats.  considering that one of the ways the brain is damaged when it over heats is through oxidative damage, I figured tha ALA couldn't hurt.  Her temperature stayed high for quite a while and after sunrise the ambient temperature started rising.  Her symptoms got worse again so we went outside where it was colder than our tent.  We stayed outside for about a half an hour until we both felt well.  At this point I was hotter than her, but I had none of the muscle weakness or incoordination that she did.

As for my own reaction while undergoing these symptoms, I didn't really think there was much to worry about for a while.  My mind was not overwhelmed at all like I've experienced with more psychedelic entheogens; it was more my body being overwhelmed and as such did not feel as dangerous.  Towards the end of the night, however, the body load reached my mind, confusing my thoughts, causing a headache, and I realized it was more than I had first believed.

Two days later and I'm still recovering.  I slept nearly the whole next day and exertion easily tires me.  My mood is about neutral with a few darker spells which I attribute to the lack of serotonin in my system.  Although I had serious health issues with AMT, I think what I gained from the experience just barely made it worth it.  Emotional issues that have caused serious rifts in my relationships have finally been identified and understood, and I hope to resolve them soon--I'm very grateful for this knowledge.  Yet due to my personal reaction to this entheogen, I do not plan to ever try it again.  I like my neurons and don't want to abuse them.</bodytext></report>
