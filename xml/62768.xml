For a long while now, I had heard about a special flower, known as the 'angel's trumpet' that was legal and grew all over the country. I knew that my grandmother grew one of these plants in her yard. A few years back, a friend named Ray told he kept taking all the flowers off of my grandmothers tree because he sold them to people and that it was possible to trip on them if you ate them. Now this was 5 or 6 years ago.

Recently, my friend N asked me if I knew if where she could get some, because she had read about it online and wanted to try it. I completely forgot about her asking me, and she moved far away a few weeks later. Then, one night I was standing in my courtyard (I had moved in with grandmother to help around the house as she is getting old) and I remembered N asking me about the flowers. So I went around to the side of the house and bingo! sixteen beautiful Angel Trumpets in full bloom.

After comparing them to pictures on the internet I determined them to be the real deal, though there were no seed pods on the tree anywhere, which was fine with me because of all the stories I've read an heard about this plant, the one involving seed digestion seem to be the worst.

Me and a fellow psychonaut named J were planning on taking a few that weekend, and after some extensive study online, I felt it would be a good idea. But J was still skeptical so I told him I'd try a little bit on Tuesday night to see how it went. Needless to say, nothing happened. So Wednesday night I upped the dosage, trying to get a feel for how much we should take. Still nothing. Thursday night I forgot but Friday night was the night. I didn't have to work till noon the next day, and I had roughly 15 hours until I needed to get up. So I waited until about 8 pm and ingested one flower, washing it down with green tea. I then proceeded to smoke one bowl of weed/flower mix and then went inside to play a video game until it kicked in.

About an hour later, I still wasn't feeling anything so I decided to go smoke a cigarette to boost the effects, I guess. Big mistake. As soon as I stood up I promptly fell against my bookcase knocking it everywhere. My entire body felt as if it was full of jell-o and everything seemed really far away from me, like I was shrinking. I then crawled outside and smoked a cigarette leaning against the fence and called a few friends to tell them how it was going. While I was laying down, I started seeing shadows move and bugs crawl across the walkway. I also heard noises coming from some of the bushes and I could hear the beat of insects wings as they flew around the garden. I finished my smoke and hauled ass inside. Thats when things got really weird.

My mouth was so dry I could feel my saliva turning white so I went to kitchen to get some more tea. After chugging two 20 oz bottles of it, I felt no relief. I figured no matter how much I drank it wouldn't go away and I'd have to live with it. So I tried to get on my computer but I could not get my eyes to focus on the screen. So I tried watching TV, but someone (or something) in the bathroom kept calling my name. So I got up and went into the bathroom but no one was there. I looked in the shower and the closet and even under the sink. This would happen many times during the night, people turning around corners and when I thought I had caught up with them they were gone.

When I returned to my room, I was surprised to find two of my co-workers in my room. One was lying on my bed wrapped up in my sheets trying to sleep, and the other was standing the corner staring at me. I tried to talk to them but all I could do was whisper. Let me point out that movement was nearly impossible. When I tried to pick things up, I would close my fingers around them when I thought I was close enough but could only grab air. Soon after I started doing the 'imaginary cigarette' thing others have experienced. Many many times that night I freaked out big time thinking I just dropped my cigarette on the floor when I went to take a drag of it and noticed it wasn't in my fingers. I would then spend the next few minutes looking for it on floor and under the bed. But it never existed.

About 4 hours into the trip I'm getting so thirsty it's ridiculous. I took a long look in the mirror and whispered to my reflection for a while before noticing how huge his pupils were. His eyes were almost completely black. During the course of the night, every time I would by my mirror I would freak out thinking it was some killer or monster trying to sneak up on me. I went to the fridge to put water in cup from the water dispenser thing, but I guess it was broken because no water came out at all. So I drank more tea. When I went back to my room, my co-worker who was standing in the corner wasn't there anymore, and I wasn't in my room I was at work and it was closing time but my boss' boss showed up and said were working all night long. Time then sped up and it was around 4 in the morning and I was still working at my job, when I realized that it wasn't real and I was just laying in my bed. My other co-worker who was under my blanket was still there, and I had taken out another of my spare blankets from closet to use for myself. I heard voices outside my window and went to take a look and saw my friend Mac out there by himself. I wasn't about to go back out there though so I tried to tell him to come inside but again I could only whisper. He was jUst standing in the courtyard, smiling and giving me a thumbs up.

I slid my door to the courtyard open and was surprised when instead of whispering, I yelled 'MAC GET INSIDE' really loud without meaning to. When I looked around the courtyard for him he was no where to be found. What is trippy about that part is that my friend Mac moved far away with N 2 weeks before this night so there was no chance he was really there but I thought by some miracle he was there.

6 hours into the trip I decided I couldn't take it anymore, the voices, the dehydration, the shadows and disappearing people were too much for me so I popped about 6 Tylenol pm, some vitamins I had and some antibiotics I got for my wisdom tooth. I kept looking at all the clocks in my room (I have 4 for some reason) and every clock said a different time. So stupid me decides there is no possible way to know what time it actually is, and I unplug all of them and took the batteries out of the last one. I got sick of my co-worker using my favorite blanket so I kicked him off the bed with my foot only to see my crumpled up blanket fall to the floor by itself. No one had been under my blanket, it was jUst piled in a way that looked like there was someone under it. I turned all the lights out and laid in bed for another 3 hours thinking about the jungle and Colorado and swimming pools when I finally got to sleep.

The aftermath

The next morning I woke up and still couldn't focus my eyes that well but I could see clearly enough to know that my room was fucked. I don't remember doing any of this but I found an empty pizza box on the floor, almost an entire pack of cigarettes strewn all over my room, and writing on my hand that said 'Hungry IT' accompanied by a swirly design. I had gone through my trash can and taken all the empty 20 oz bottle of green tea and set them on random items in my room such as my TV, my mirror, in the one of my pant's pocket in my closet and I found one floating in the toilet. My pupils were still dilated, though not as bad as the night before. What I found to be most strange about the trip is that for almost the entire night I never felt alone, I felt like there were other people in the room with me even if I couldn't see them. And I would talk to them or show them something I had found, such as a sock under my dresser.

Brugmansia is one hell of a plant. It put a notch on my drug belt, and I never plan on doing it again. In retrospect, I might have affected the way the trip went without even meaning to, being as inexperienced as I am at mind-altering substances.</bodytext></report>
