That was the time I was 19 and since my father as a MD has many books and good friends of a nice pharmacist friend of the family and owner of one of the largest pharmacies in our area it was normal for me, as a naturally curious person, to check out on the 'smart drugs' book I found in his library.

Piracetam was easy to get and cheap, so I give it a try. The effects of this drugs are not regular. I mean, sometimes you dont feel nothing but sometimes you get nice dreams. I never noticed nothing different while conscious.

Well I had this kick ass dream once, that was like being in an action movie. It was very clear for me in the dream that what happened was a 'show' for me, to see how cool it could be. It was like that in the dream: as I was walking down the street everyone was so colorful, shiny and crisp. Objects were so very well defined and movements smooth and fast. Then a bus passed by filled with guys with machine guns and started to blast everywhere, then I could hear the bullets passing by my ears and ricocheting. Also as the bullts hit cars and stuff the sparkles were amazingly realistic. Dont consider it a bad trip or nightmare, that was not the concept of the dream in the first place so I waked with a smile on my face.

I started taking Piractem in order to improve my learning skills and concentration in studying for tests. It never happened for me.

I gave some pills to a friend of mine and he said he completed a test, achieving 100% right questions in just 25 minutes. No difference for me though.</bodytext></report>
