I'd just come home from a six day stay at one of the local mental hospitals when my sister pulled me aside and said she had a present for me.  5-MeO-DiPT, which I'd never even heard of.  I was pretty excited, because most of my experiences with tripping have been disappointing, and I had a feeling this would be much more interesting.

So we each took a 10mg capsule and then split and snorted the last we had, so we were both up to 15mg.  The taste was so completely awful, worse than anything I'd ever taken before.  I felt the bit I snorted almost immediately, but it wasn't very intense.  We sat down and watched Alice in Wonderland for awhile and everything just looked a little odd.  Then the 10mg I swallowed kicked in, and though I remember almost everything that happened, it's all in a non-linear jumble.

A couple friends came over and one had a cat in her lap, I went and bowed down to her and called her the Queen of Sheba.  I have no idea what Sheba is.  Someone said a catfood.  Not sure.  I saw something on the floor and thought it was a slug.  I was just a little off and extremely aroused for about the first hour and everything was really funny.  Then I felt really sick and went and vomited.  I felt gross, but I didn't think about it too long because the vines in the tiles in my bathroom started moving and growing.  I stared at them for awhile and then went back out (after brushing my teeth, of course), and was hit by the strong urge to cuddle.  The non-Queen of Sheba friend, who had just downed some DXM, cuddled with me.  I started relaxing into the trip and just feeling calm and watching everything around me.  There were a lot of really neat trails that amused me endlessly; I watched my hand for about a half hour.  The walls were a kalidascope.  I listened to my tripping friend for awhile; she was seeing a lot of really odd stuff.

I don't know what led up to it, but at some point my sister started messing with me and my trip became extremly mental.  We talked about reality and personality and all sorts of things.  My sister was apparently worried my trip was going to go bad, because I kept asking if certain things had actually happened, like my experience in the hospital.  Everything became unsure, but it didn't bother me.  My sister told me to stop thinking so much, but I felt as though I was on the verge of an epiphany.  I asked who she was, knowing she was my sister, but unsure of her place in my life in the world.  I told her she was a million different people and finally that she was an angel.  I asked then who I was.  There was confusion and a lot of stuff going on in my head.  This was one of things I'd been thinking about for a long time previous to this trip: who I was, trying to get a grasp of self.  And when I asked that, my sister said, 'You're whoever you want to be.'  Time paused for a moment for me, mentally, it felt like everything grew bigger, and my entire world was her looking at me and this statement echoing in my head.  I was in awe.

After a few more minutes of talking, I was in heaven.  I had a huge smile on my face, and I told the people I was with that I loved them and gave them all hugs.  I felt like everything was so beautiful and wonderful.  I told my sister she was my guardian angel.  A few minutes later we were talking about changing the world, and I said that I was going to, right that minute, so I stood up and spread my arms out like I was hugging everything, and felt my happiness and peacefulness spread out into the world.

The DXM started kicking in, and I began to view things very objectively: no good or bad.  The four of us had a long conversation about right and wrong and morals that I have very little recollection of.  I drove to get cigarettes and then went and laid down to see things in my head, and then slept for a few hours.

The next few days I was in an extremely good mood.  This trip was the best drug experience I've ever had.  I did experience vomiting and diarrhea, but neither of them bothered me too much because I ws focused on other things.  The DXM and the 5-MeO-DiPT seemed to react together pretty well.  I can't tell why I had such a strong trip.  Perhaps because I'm still fairly new to drugs and especially tripping, perhaps because of my expectations of it, or maybe because of the medication I'm on, Celexa, an SSRI.  One thing I want to mention, and I'm not sure why this is happening, but my experience was about a week and a half ago and when I wake up for a bit after only sleeping an hour or two, I'm tripping.  Visual, though, not mental.  I see trails and flashes of light and stuff.  I really don't know what it's from.  It doesn't bother me, just surprises me.  But oh well.  A good enviroment and good people made this one of the best things that has ever happened to me.</bodytext></report>
