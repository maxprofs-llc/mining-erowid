I tried some wild dagga resin today, not knowing what results to find. the resin was hard to get smoke from but eventually I got numerous hits from it. the effects were very interesting unlike any other I had experienced before. I felt kind of lost and slight buzz. but that was about it.  An hr later and I have a headache from the junk.</bodytext></report>
