Unable to fall asleep at night time and suspecting some sort of depression, I saw my general practitioner who pescribed me some Stilnox sleeping tablets. I had no preconceived expectations of what these tablets might bring but was warned by the doctor to only take one at a time.

When I got the brown paper bag home I took out the box and removed the sheet of sealed tablets. The pescription told me to only take one of the tablets which were the size of a tic tac, so I pushed one out of its foil barrier and downed it with several mouthfuls of water.  Immediately after this I sat down at my computer to type an email and after about 15 mins still did not start to feel any effects. I pushed another small tablet out of its foil and swallowed it and sat down again and began to type. After about 5 minutes I began to feel really tired and when I went to lift my head to look at the clock my head felt four times heavier than usual.

I tried to stand up but slumped back into the chair as my body felt too heavy for my legs to support. I giggled to myself in a woozy, heavy kind of way. I could no longer type any messages as I was in too much of a daze and I looked into the mirror only to find a stupid smile on my face along with half closed eyes. My phone rang and it was my friend wanting a to chat. I ended up asking him over to my house and when he arrived he had to carry me up the stairs to my room and I explained to him the tablets that I had taken.

Everything after that is a bit of a blur. The next morning I woke up and there was a used condom on the floor next to my bed and a big puke stain on the carpet. Apparently my friend proceeded to have sex with me after he carried me to my room however I do not remember consenting as I do not remember the act itself. I felt very lethargic the next morning and cleaned up the puke which was presumably mine.

I took the tablets once more after this incident when I was experiencing a particularly horrifying unrinry tract infection and was home alone. I thought I was going to die of pain and there was no one to take me to the hospital, further more I could not walk or crawl to get the phone to call the ambulance as I was curled up in a ball of the most terrifying pain of my life. I managed to get two stilnox into me as I hoped they would knock me out and dull the pain. All they successfully did was make me as dopy as I have previously described. Finally my flatmate returned home and rushed me off to the hospital where I remember nothing furthermore except sitting on the toilet trying to pee for at least an hour.

It has been my experience that sleeping tablets when taken in moderation can be a useful tool in gaining sleep but when taken unwisely can cause blackouts in memory, which in turn can make you a vunerable target.</bodytext></report>
