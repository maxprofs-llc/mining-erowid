Listen, I got bored one day and my friend was nagging me to try this, so I grabbed some papers from gum rappers and rolled that shit up and got a mild to medium high and I was really happy and felt tired yet alert. This was many years ago and I stopped at 15. I did it about 6 more times. Every time I felt the same. A few years later I tried weed, pills, liquor, and cigarettes. I've quit all but the drinking. A cheap relaxing high.</bodytext></report>
