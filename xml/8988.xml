I tried salvia 5x extract about an hour ago.  I had sent away by the internet for some, along with a pipe to smoke it in (I don't smoke).  I am on prescription medication; I take paxil, 30 mg per day, which supposedly would help me with depression and 'social anxiety.'  I also take a multivitamin every day.

I was very conflicted about trying it.  First, I had never tried any drug save for alcohol, and then only a few times.  Second (and this probably sounds strange to most people), I was afraid that, if I ever have a girlfriend (I'm in my late twenties, am straight, and have never had a girlfriend) she might not like me if she found out I ever did a drug.  Third, I was concerned about the affects; since I have no friends who I'm close enough to to be a sitter and make sure I not hurt myself, I worried that I might inadvertantly start a fire.  Fourth, I had done some reading on the 'net about how some consider this a sacred plant.  Even though I'm not particularly religious, I was (and am) still somewhat cautious/afraid that I was not going to use the drug spiritually, but rather for my own enteretainment.  I guess I feared performing a sacrilege.

I tried it anyway.  I went to my apartment bathroom, where if I dropped the pipe, it would presumably not start a fire on the tiles.  I opened the small vial the salvia came it and put a very small amount in the pipe.  I used a lighter and held the flame over it as I inhaled (the instructions suggested I do this), and smoked.  I didn't feel anything.  I did this several more times with very small pinches of salvia, all to no effect.  I then took (what seemed like) a large amount, put it in the pipe, and smoked it.  I smoked another amount of about the same size.  I may have smoked a third or even fourth time, but I don't remember.

I had music playing on the radio ('Tainted Love') and when I heard the part of the song where it switches over to those words from the supremes song ('Baby, baby, where did our love go...') I thought the music was actually an airplane flying over my apartment building.  I was sitting on the bathroom floor (I had tried to walk, and it was dizzying).  I closed my eyes and (it's hard to explain) I felt as if I were part of the floor, and the floor was moving in waves.

One important effect/mindset during the whole experience was my original concern that this may be a spiritual tool (and not a recreational toy).  In the various patterns, etc., that I saw, I shifted in my thoughts from 'cool, this is an interesting trip' to 'cool, this can be a spiritual journey.'  I guess I retained enough of my rational senses that I felt a tug-of-war, so to speak from this high in trying to assess the meaning or whatever.

I guess I take from this a few things.  First, my curiosity about other drugs is actually less acute than before.  I have no idea if it's like marijuana, etc., but having felt my first non-alcohol chemically induced altered state, I realize that life can be full without these drugs (though I might try it again).  I appreciate 'sobriety' more than I otherwise might have before.

Second, I think there's something to the spiritual connotations with the drug.  One's experience might be richer if they did it somehow in a spiritual context.  'Spiritual' is a vague and abstract word, I know, but it seems to fit in with the experience.  This drug might work good either for meditation or for communication with another person on a deeper level.  I wouldn't think people would have fun partying with it.

I consider myself lucky that no serious harm came to me.  I had no 'sitter' to watch me should I have done something foolish.  Also, given a different environment or different preparation (in terms of research into salvia), this might have been a scary, unpleasant, even dangerous experience.  If you really want to try this, I hope you are fortunate enough to have a friend who's willing to 'sit' for you.

I would also advise against driving even several hours after use even though the noticeable effects appear to have worn off within an hour.  As far as I know, the drug is legal, though in some localities it might not be.</bodytext></report>
