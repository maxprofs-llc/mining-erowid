I'm not as new as I used to be to drugs, and I'm slowly beginning to be comfortable with losing my mind during any given night. I have been very careful with myself, in mind and body, but the one drug that I least suspected to throw me into a bad trip ended up sneaking up from behind and smacking me upside the head.

I have been taking 5-HTP for a while, and I had heard that it intensified the effects of weed. After using it nightly, I decided to use it just as I was hitting up with my friends and getting stoned, just to really see if it was indeed going to increase and heighten my weed experience. The 2 previous nights I had taken about 150-200mg, and decided to take a couple that night as well. Taking 2 pills just before my first hit, we quickly fashioned a setup of a gravity bong and began getting very, very stoned. I've always considered myself a lowballer, and I hadn't smoked for a while, so I took it easy.

My first hit was very difficult. Although the gravity bong's smoke was cool and calm, the method of forcing it down into my lungs so quickly caused me to go into a coughing fit. A couple signs that I really hadn't smoked very much in quite a long time. Fortunately, after feeling a bit stoned, the second hit came easier - although a few lingering coughs and burns still remained. The 5-HTP definitely had a very large effect on my experience, as I came up harder and faster than I was expecting. As stoned as I was, we still kept going and took a couple more hits each. My last hit, the 4th if I can recall correctly, had me violently coughing and swallowing a bit of bong water. Very nasty.

The coughing lasted for quite some time, and I was beginning to burp in between the coughs with a bit more force than I was fond of. Soon enough, I became stoned to the point where I began to lose conscious thought process and awareness of the environment around me. I faded into some kind of closed eye visual state quickly, and felt myself losing hold on reality. I think I was eating some fruit snacks or something, but I'm not sure how much I really ate.

I believe that I was feeling very nauseated and sick for the next hour or so, as I closed my eyes and traveled along a vast hallucination on the insides of my eyelids. Opening my eyes was impossible and undesired, as I could feel nothing of the outside world and couldn't understand what my friends were saying. They asked me if I was OK, and I remember being unable to answer. They asked a couple more times, and I was able to mumble something of 'I think so...maybe...' I couldn't understand or remember anything else about what they said to me.

The nausea that I was feeling felt so fake and unreal that I didn't understand what my body was telling me. My head was so far away from the world that my bodily feeling was something that didn't matter. Opening my eyes for more than a couple seconds was impossible, and my imagination and hallucinations were peaking in an intense flurry of ego disintegration.

Eventually, I began to feel a rumble in my stomach and realized just soon enough that my body was wanting to purge my stomach contents. Unable to get up or open my eyes, I asked for the empty licorice tub that we had around and proceeded to violently vomit twice into it. I'm unable to really remember much of this, except for the harsh feeling and burning in my nose and mouth. I remember instantly coming down a bit, enough to apologize to my friends intently and actually get up and take the bucket to the bathroom with me, where I remained for the next couple hours.
/n

My face into the toilet, I hallucinated and dreamed my way through a thousand realities, continually fighting the high and feeling desperately deformed in my ability to function and exist. The world around me existed, I knew that, but I didn't understand how I could return to it. Whenever I would open my eyes to move or to adjust myself around the room, I would not know where I was or how the bathroom was laid out, let alone how I had gotten there or who was in the house. Eventually, I lay on my back and passed out on the dirty bathroom floor for a while. My friends were nervous to come in, but eventually did and woke me up. I couldn't feel the difference between waking up and being passed out, the realities I was walking through were still as vivid and real, they were just cut into with the visions my eyes would produce while open.
/n

Finally, after passing out a couple more times and spending a couple more hours hallucinating, I was able to get myself up and take my place on the couch in the room next door. I finally fell asleep and continued hallucinating in my dreams until about 11:30 AM the next morning, when I was awoken by my cellphone.

I rejoiced at the fact that my mind was conscious and awake enough to actually answer the phone and talk to my mother, who didn't seem to notice any flaws with my sentences or speech pattern. I sighed and reflected on the night behind me when the drug I least expected to hit me did just that. Although my friends didn't handle it perfectly, they always supported me and had honest concern for my situation and status, and I appreciate that. I learned that every single drug can be something to fear; whether I expect the intensity or not, it can sneak up so easily and take hold of my mind and body.

I really strongly urge anyone that is sensitive to weed and/or is taking 5-HTP supplements to be very careful about taking very high dosages of marijuana, as it sparks an intensity normally masked by the sweet and easy-going drug.</bodytext></report>
