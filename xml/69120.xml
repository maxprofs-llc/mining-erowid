I have been taking Trazodone off and on for insomnia or about 7 years. It works well, is not addictive, and has no recreational use. However, it gives me absolutely insane dreams. I normally have vivid dreams but the nightmares with Trazodone are more intense. But hell, at least I sleep.</bodytext></report>
