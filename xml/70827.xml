I tried writing a 4 page trip report detailing my exact trip down to every detail, but then I realized that the only way attept to capture an event so profoundly bizarre is to write a poem while 1/15th at the edge of reality.

I realize that is this website is designed to display catagorical data about drug use, but what I experienced can't be explained with normal language, in the same way that emotions cannot be expressed in normal language.

The details of my set and setting are unimportant as I had no connection my earth bound exist for the 10 or so minutes that I was in the hard trip. But just for refrence, I was in a room with friends.

Your mist tasted of strangeness
/n
the people said goodbye 
/n
I was gripped into your depths
/n
 at an alarming rate.
/n
My limbs were ripped off and I ceased to exist along with my friend, time.
/n
we saw god who was revealed as everybody in the room being ripped apart.
/n
tearing. everywhere.
/n
the true state of reality was chaos.
/n
I was being pulled and cracked -- god  was  breaking.
/n
I could not exist for much longer in this universe. The dark energy was too strong for me.
/n
Sudden I saw the puzzle pieces reforming.
/n
I wasn't ready to see into infinity so I was sent back.

	Maybe reality can be handled one frame at a time. but perhaps not all at once.</bodytext></report>
