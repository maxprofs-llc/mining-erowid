Basically, i cant understand how so many people could make so many silly mistakes with dose. I researched the dose, measured it out in a medicine thingy (the conical things with mls on it), mixed in in drink and sipped in slowly over about 1/2 hour. Effect where sensed even after a few sips, which basically i sumerize as :
/n
/n
(T+1/2 - T+1 1/2) Extreme relaxation to the body similar to alcohol, but mentally alert and coherant.
/n
/n
(T+2-4) Cheerfulness and pleasent mood, enjoyment of music and dancing.
/n
/n
No nasuea, no dizziness, nothing bad at all. Very nice. Much better than alcohol - no mental fuzziness or confusion.
/n
/n
To all those ppl who had bad experiences, would you skull a litre of pure alcohol in a few minutes? Well GHB is basically the same only more concentrated. Dilute it heaps and sip it slowly (the best advice i can give, coz then you feel it coming on), its not e or acid, its more like 1000 proof alcohol. And get your dose right!</bodytext></report>
