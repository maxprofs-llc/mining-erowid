I have ventured into a new level of myself.  The key which gave me access to the gateway and beyond was DXM .  I took 710 mg of this great drug in the form of Robitussin DM.  Please excuse my grammar and spelling for I will be writing this in a notebook throughout my trip.  Before I continue I should tell you that I was kind of stoned before I took the DXM.

Oh god, that was disgusting.  It took all of my willpower to stifle the urge to hurl.  Now I just have to sit here patiently and wait for it to kick in.

I've started to notice a very sudden slowing down of time and the world around me, it feels like I'm checking the clock every 10 to 15 minutes or so yet only seconds have gone by.  Normally I wouldn't mind this transition but it really sucks right now because I'm waiting for my friend to come over so he can watch me trip in case I get hurt (and of course so we can chill).  I can tell you this, waiting for something when every minute feels like an eternity is really annoying.

I'm still waiting for my friend.  Though it's only been a half an hour according to my clock, it feels like it's been forever.  If he doesn't get here soon I'm going to go insane.  I am so confused right now, nothing makes any sense yet it all makes perfect sense.  I can't really describe this feeling, it's as if I know everything, yet everything I know is wrong.  I know it seems confusing, which would explain why I'm so goddamn confused right now.

I'm starting to come down from my trip.  Sorry I didn't keep up with my half hourly pace, but the night was too wild for that.  I'll explain everything that happened in the 6 and a half hours since I last wrote.  While waiting for my friend I started surfing the web for information.  I had so many questions and needed so many answers.  During that time I gained a lot of knowledge, more than I'll ever really need.  One of the things I looked up was DXM, I found out that if you mix even the tiniest bit of alcohol the trip is said to skyrocket to whole new levels, I'm going to try this (But that will be next time).  When my friend finally arrived we spent some time watching TV and surfing the web.

My friend left after a little while, I thought he was going to stay over but I guess he was mad because he didn't get messed up.  He left me all alone.  I took a trip through my memories then.  I saw things happen right before my eyes which had occurred many years ago in my life, and then without a trace they were all gone.  After that I felt that I needed to do something other than sit in a computer chair for my whole trip, so I decided to walk downstairs.  I was worried my sister might be down there with her friends so I walked down the stairs as slowly and quietly as I could (I smoke with her all the time, but if she found out I was doing this she would rat me out without a second thought).  Finally I reached the bottom step, looked around, and realized she had gone out.  I smoke with her all the time, but if she found out I was doing this she would rat me out without a second thought.

After what seemed like a very long time my sister and her friends came home.  They could tell the instant they saw me that I was messed up.  My sister asked me what I had taken and I choked out the answer, 'I'm just stoned'.  I'm pretty sure she didn't believe me but she just let it go for the time being.  Every time someone would talk to me something that seemed to surround me (like a force field of some sort) limited my motor and vocal skills.  So basically everything I said came out sounding slurred, mixed up, and not anywhere near what I meant to say.  I tried to play it off by attempting to focus on a movie my sister had ordered off of Pay-Per-View.  This attempt was to no avail for my sister noticed my restlessness and the fact that my body seemed constricted to wear I sat.

She asked me once again if I had done anything other than weed, I refused to drop my story so she gave up asking.  One of her friends decided to cook dinner while the rest of us waited.  Great another long wait, I really wish I didn't have to go through waiting again, but I passed the time traveling within my mind.  I could see, become or do anything I desired, it was strange but really cool.  Suddenly, I was ripped out of my personal euphoria by my sister handing me a plate of food.  I ate my fill and sat waiting to see what would happen next.  My sister and one of her friends went outside somewhere for a walk.  I was left there with another friend.  We went downstairs and took some massive bong hits together, which only succeeded in lifting my trip and prolonging it even further.  They wanted to smoke a blunt but were worried that my mother might come home and catch us, so they decided to go for a car ride.  Instantly I asked if I could go, and they said they didn't mind.

The car ride was intense, it was the most incredible thing I had ever experienced up to this point in my life.  The flashing lights breaking through the darkness, the metallic blaring on the stereo, and just anything that flashed by all mixed together to put me in a state of total coolness.  During this seemingly long car ride, they lit up the blunt.  Eventually it reached me and accidentally I didn't conserve anything.  I sucked in to hard and shrunk the blunt to half of it's original size.  Everyone wasn't to happy with me, but they let it drop just as suddenly as it had happened. During the ride I saw a friend of ours in the back of someones car.  We stopped at a light next to them and talked until the light turned green.  I waved as they drove off.  Some time later the car stopped and everyone started getting out.  I had no clue where we were but I followed not wanting to be left out.  It turned out to be the end of my street and we walked up to my house.  I sat down on the ground and started watching the movie again with my sister.  Again I couldn't focus so I just laid down and thought about numerous things.

Once again I reached the point where I could see, become or do anything I desired.  Again I was suddenly ripped out of this state, but this time it was to the opening of a door.  The last memory that had gone through my head before this was of the car ride and how I saw the friend riding in the back seat.  I looked up and to my utter amazement she was the one who had come in.  I felt the need to ask her about it, but when I did she replied, 'No I've been at home all day.'  Not realizing the sarcasm in her tone, I started going nuts.  I doubted the reality of everything around me, nothing seemed real, it was all a big lie.  I thought that maybe the car ride had only taken place for me and if that was true, then my mind was lying to me.  I was so confused.  Then one of the others there noticing my obvious disarrangement said, 'Yes she was in a car she was only messing with you'.  Suddenly I felt relieved, the world was real after all.

It was getting late and everybody started leaving, which eventually left me and my sister there alone.  She looked at me from time to time but said nothing.  One of her friends came to the door around 11:50 PM and told us she saw my mom parking up at the end of the street.  My sister went to bed and not thinking, I just stayed where I was watching the TV.  My mom came in and said hi, then she walked to the kitchen to grab a quick snack before bed.  While she was in there she started talking to me.  I had no clue what she was saying, nothing sounded even in the least bit audible, I tried to ask her what she was saying but the constriction came back and I couldn't push the words out.  So instead I just acted like I was really into the movie that was on and kept shushing her.  That was the best I could do to keep her from knowing I was really messed up.  Then when she started up the steps I tried to say goodnight but all that came out was some incoherent babble.  She asked me what I was saying but didn't stick around for an answer.  After that I watched some more TV and then began writing this.  Now I'm going to try and get some sleep.</bodytext></report>
