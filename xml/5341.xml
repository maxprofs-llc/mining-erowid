MDMA Protocol
/n
/n
Night prior (8-12 hours prior to ingestion): 1 Prozac, 20mg
/n
/n
Morning on waking: 4-5 Cal-Mg tablets. (Must be CHELATE: Not Dolomite or
/n
Oyster Shell) and 50 - 100mg 5-HTP
/n
/n
Ingestion: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets
/n
/n
Booster: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets. 50 - 100 mg 5-HTP
/n
/n
4hrs after Ingestion: 1 Prozac, 20mg
/n
/n
Remarks:
/n
/n
Cal-Mg is best absorbed as Chelate. Takes 8 hours for Carbonate (Dolomite).
/n
Total dose is about 2 RDAs, not very much. Eliminates Jaw Chattering. Also
/n
note, that the Jaw is the primal expressive organ for all  chordates, and
/n
serotonin very applicable. Full leeches given serotonin then double their
/n
blood load. Knowing this paradoxically lessens jaw problems, part of psych
/n
prep for new users (sez my foaf).
/n
/n
Prozac reduces tendency to clench and grind jaw. Considerably molllifies
/n
the wiped out feeling for the day after. Have no reports re other SSRIs
/n
such as Zoloft.
/n
/n
5-HTP lenghens the return time, much smoother and lasts longer. Seems to
/n
allow learning to be absorbed better.
/n
/n
Note that side effects curve is steep, try 20mg less and you may have much
/n
less of them.
/n
/n
PS. This protocol is very effective and known to work well.</bodytext></report>
