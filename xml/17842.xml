I had discovered Ultram by accident when a doctor prescribed it to me for an eye injury. I had done my research on the internet as to how much of a dose to take. After that I decided to take about 4 or 5 of them at once to see what they would do. That was about 8 months ago and I am still taking the drug almost every day.

Ultram, while not an opiate, is a lot like an opiate with a little bit of a twist. Sometimes when I take it I think that it makes me speed a little bit too. Ultram gives me a great warm itchy feeling with a pretty good body buzz. The best thing about Ultram is the feeling of warmth towards the rest of the world it gives me. When I am on Ultram I feel that I can do anything and that the world is a much better place. It takes away all of my aches and pains as I think that I have a little bit of arthritis, and it just makes me feel good and happy all around. This drug has really brightened up my life and I am glad that I found it.

They say that Ultram isnt addictive and they classify it as an analgesic. I think that they are wrong because I think that it is very addictive especially with someone that has a problem with opiates and drugs like them. I dont think that I am hooked on the drug, but it can be hard to stop taking them at times.</bodytext></report>
