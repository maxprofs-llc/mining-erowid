I was somewhat depressed at night so I really wanted to sleep. I popped 4 trazadone of 30mg each. My psychiatrist perscribed these to me to help sleep if I felt as though I was too alive late at night. I quickly started feeling extremly tired, so I layed down to sleep. Unfortunatly not falling asleep for over an hour I lay there having weird thoughts and seeing things. Finally I fall asleep. I wake up approximatly 8 hours later with an extremly dry mouth. And in the back of my throat, a large cluster of thick brown, jello like mucus. I have never seen or heard of anything such as this before. For rest of the day I felt as if I had strep throat or something such as that. Ever since I havent even taken 1 trazadone.</bodytext></report>
