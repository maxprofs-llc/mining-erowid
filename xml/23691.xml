I had never done mushrooms before until last night.  Myself and a friend of mine each ingested an eighth of mushrooms at 6:15 pm by the simple method of tossing them in our mouths, grinding them up good, and swallowing.  I had only eaten lunch prior to this.  They tasted just like regular mushrooms, in fact I honestly enjoyed the flavor.  We planned to go to a classical guitar concert at 7:30, so we just waited around for the effects to kick in.  We noticed the first effects around 30 minutes after ingestion, when my friend looked in the mirror and his pupils were extremely dilated.  He said mine were as well, and sure enough, a look in the mirror confirmed this fact.  I started to notice I was thinking a little strangely.  An hour after ingestion, I stared at my hand to see if I had any visuals.  At first, the staring at my hand made me feel silly, but then the colors and shading of my hand started to shift a bit, until eventually my hand was a swirling mass of reds and pinks that formed into various shapes, most notably flower shapes.  I was very excited, as I was really getting some effects.

By the time we were heading out for the classical guitar concert, my experience was really getting revved up.  Colors were much brighter, everything seemed in a sort of haze, and I was experiencing some body load.  I was not, and never was nauseous during the experience.  The body load was a bit nice actually, mostly just a feeling of heaviness, with a bit of buzz. My thinking was extremely clear, and I wanted to relate my experience to my non-altered-state friends around me, but I felt that it would be foolish.  Notably, on the walk to the concert, I noticed that a friend of mine was very jittery, and she stayed that way.  She had an intense feeling of 'wrongness' or 'error' about her, and I did not want to associate with her, I avoided her consistently throughout the night.  Other people also become very strange, and the only person I really wanted to talk to was my friend that was also tripping.  Almost every person became some sort of mutant or freak, they weren't scary, it was just that I could sense that something was very wrong with a lot of people, and I could not handle the sensation.

We got to the hall the concert was held at, and sat down. While staring at the program, it did much the same thing that my hand had done, visually, swirling with flower shapes and such.  The concert started, and many of the pieces were duos between guitarists, and the sound was amazing.  Being a musician myself, I contemplated the distinct timbre of the instrument, its various colors, and interestingly enough, I could detect all the faults with their playing, and all the great parts of the playing very easily.  I can understand why musicians sometimes take mushrooms and jam under the influence now.  The music was amazing, but also what was amazing was the fact that the performers remained very real, but all around them the walls were distorting and shifting.  Also, the light in the concert hall seemed to keep subtly changing colors.  The concert hall has a pipe organ in it, and the bass pipes are prominently displayed above the players, and they dominated the scene.  They would distort, bow, and wave about, and the color of the organ was very intense and difficult to take all in.  The concert was a good two hour ordeal, getting out at 9:30, and it was a very amazing experience.

We walked back to our residence, and on the way back, I realized that it was impossible for me to communicate in a meaningful fashion with the people around me, simply because I felt the thoughts I had about the concert were too complex and profound to explain adequately, I also felt that anything anyone was saying was pretty much useless garbage, not fit to listen to, dramatically colored by their preconceptions about the way things should be.  We got back to the residence, and I decided to smoke some salvia extract, as I had heard it was very intense on mushrooms.  I have done it before a number of times, and it was quite interesting, but I wanted to see what it was like on mushrooms, particularly since I already knew what the pure mushroom experience was like.

After smoking the first bowl of salvia, I just leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes.  I entered a complete separate universe, just like I had entered the mushroom universe.  There was nothing except my internal dialogue, which was so strong it seemed to be coming from beyond myself and I remembered sounds, which I seemed to be hearing as they were made, with my ear directly up next to the sound source. I was leaning against the back of my chair, and it felt like my universe shifted to that same angle, and I realized that the 'normal' universe is already at an angle, and I realized how flawed any interpretation of just about anything is.

I smoked another bowl of salvia, and my friend came into my room, and with my eyes open, I felt a complete separation from the universe, like the universe was a towel wrapped around my body, just a thin shell.  My friend smoked some salvia, but he said he just felt extremely 'heavy.'

We went to get some food from a local diner (now it's about 10), and the diner seemed like a carnival, with everyone around seeming like a complete and utter alien.  We ordered our food and had an intense conversation that revolved around processing the mushroom experience. At the time, I had decided that the normal universe was simply a shell, or sheath with no insides, and only an external mold. I also decided the universe wrapped around, and everything is simply bumps on this sort of flat, paper-thin pancake mold of the universe.

When we left the diner, at about 10:45, there was an extremely torrential thunderstorm, and we decided to just walk back to our residence.  It was a wild experience, with cracking, booming thunder and rain so heavy that there was actually ankle deep running water wherever we walked.  This was the tail-end of the mushroom experience, and a fitting and cosmic end to it.  When we got back we were sopping wet, almost completely back into reality, and completely refreshed, relaxed, and satisfied.  It was an extremely positive experience.  Both myself and my friend went into it not knowing what to expect, and coming away with another completely different way of perceiving people, the world, and ultimately the universe.</bodytext></report>
