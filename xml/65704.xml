A friend of mine (a close friend's wife) died yesterday by inhaling the chemicals in a computer duster.  I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous these drugs are.  They are NOT intended for human consumption, thus the companies that make dusters are not held accountable for what chemicals they put in them.

She was one of the most beautiful, vibrant, caring people anyone could be lucky enough to have known, and I will attend her funeral tomorrow morning.  This is truly a tragedy (and a shock to all who knew her), and nothing can be gained from her passing except the advice I'm passing on to all who are curious about the drug.</bodytext></report>
