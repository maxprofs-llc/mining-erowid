I'm a frequent DXM user who enjoys the mellow feeling of a first plateau buzz. I'd like to share my report of some of DXM's lingering afteraffects for a chronic user. I've found that I'm impotent when under the influence of DXM. Thankfully, it's temporary so I can corrolate that dysfunction to Dex use. It messes with my prostate, sometimes swelling it up so large that I can't pee even though my bladder is full. Again, it's temporary, and I've been able to corrolate this with Dex use. It gives me the shakes, something that goes away when I don't take DXM.

I've been a chronic DXM user for the past 3 years, with an average frequency of two or three bottles of Robo every week. Yeah, I guess you could say I'm addicted, but my pattern has shown me that it's a psychological addiction because I have no lingering physical effects. I guess when the side effects get too bad, I'll stop.</bodytext></report>
