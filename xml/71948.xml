Once I was the kind of guy to sample and try any drug I could get my hands on. I've done just about every drug you can name except meth and crack. I usually just stick with weed and psychedelics since they aren't really that bad for you. But one summer I ventured to Vancouver for 2 months. Little did I realize that I would soon become a daily ecstacy user. Beforehand I had never even tried such a substance, but because it was soo cheap ($5 a tab) it was becoming a ritual.

Well after my fun summer of ecstacy, weed, hash, lsd-25 and mushrooms I returned to my home state of Georgia. The following months after I was becoming more and more depressed. I went to my doctor and was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. So he prescribed me Seroquel 200 mg. The first 2 months I just took it before bed because it knocked me the hell out. But after that it didn't make me drowsy any more, but instead made me feel how I used to! I'm doing just fine now. After I take it, it just makes me feel just dandy!:)</bodytext></report>
