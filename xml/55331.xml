Well where to begin? This was my first time with mescaline, Ive done a number of other substances, but none have ever put me in such awe. Through out this whole experience I kept thinking how I could ever even write a report on it, Ill do my best though.

Anyway there were 3 of us all on the same dose, me, my brother M and his best friend C. We decided to do it at this forest/nature area type of place that has all these trails and rivers that we know like the back of our hand. We got there around 12:30 and found a spot to start dosing next to this huge stone thing that had a mushroom and pot leaf logo painted on it. We each had two bags of very potent cacti powder to ingest. M simply dumped one of his bags in a cup full of lemon juice and chugged it like nothing I had a little harder time. I tried his lemon juice drink type of way and took much longer to drink that horrible tasting drink, we then waited a bit to take our second baggies. I wound up parachuting my next little baggy full of powder(multiple parachutes). C mixed his with Gatorade and drank it, M did the lemon juice method again. By this time we had ventured father into the trails of the forest.

Mescaline is so amazingly discreet the way it comes up, it kinda just SLOWLY crawls over me and keeps getting stronger its very gentile with its approach. The first thing I noticed was feeling slightly stoned and I tiny strange feeling in my limbs. C said he needed to go poop and all 3 of us laughed hysterically for quite some time about that. We then walked about 20 feet onto this spot with tall grass on it. I looked around at the scenery and it all seemed a bit dreamy, we all commented how we felt like lord of the rings hobbits just venturing around and laughed about that. Then literally right then a young Deer walked by us a little farther up. We were all amazed at this, all the times weve been here weve never scene anything like a deer. I mean sure its a nature area type of place but it is in the middle of our town. We all agreed that seeing the deer was a good omen and the start of a great trip. Thats when things began to escalate more.

We quietly followed the deer for a while discussing what it could be thinking and how anyone could kill such a beautiful creature just to merely kill it. It eventually trotted out of site and we decided keep walking. We were all sweating quite a bit, this continued all through out the trip. Eventually we went through this trail that led us to one of the coolest spots at that lake. It was right on the side of the river and had these trees that grew outward onto the lake so that the leaves kind of formed a little haven that no one else could really see into and you could sit on the branches (this area was just simply called the spot for the rest of the day).

Across from the spot was a field of cows with orchards behind it. We all marveled at how big the cows were and how amazing nature is, the orchards disturbed us a bit how after all this time in the forest seeing nature grow freely, seeing plants in rows just didnt seem right. The feel of mescaline is so unique I cant even describe it. I feel very light 'fluffy' almost and the headspace is not foggy but crystal clear almost, yet so dreamy at the same time. Through the whole trip I felt like I was in a dream. All of us were pretty sedated for some reason so we decided to lie down in our spot, maybe try to nap. I started feeling chills all over my body and some good euphoria. The sun was reflecting light off the water onto the leaves above us and it created such a cool effect of waving light everywhere. The pure silence of it was amazing, I became very in tune with nature I looked at the trees and saw such age in them and realized how inferior I am to them in that respect. I pondered how amazing it was that such a big strong tree came from a small fragile seed/ While looking at the trippy lights, the sounds of bird chirps, whistling insects, the cool breeze ruffling leaves, and the river slapping on the sides of the banks permeated and punctuated the silence as if nature was playing a song for us.

In some moments it was the most peaceful serene thing I had ever been apart of. I noticed pretty much the whole time we had been at the spot I had a stick in my hand, and it just felt really good to have that stick so I kept it pretty much throughout most of the trip, almost as if I had a personal relationship with it, this stick was somehow different and special compared to others.

We began feeling adventurous again so we went out back onto the trails. Everything was so beautiful the clouds the sky, the leaves on the ground that water the flowers. The world is such an amazing place and man is destroying it. We kept seeing the mushroom and pot leaf symbol that was on the stone thing where we dosed painted everywhere on certain items all day long, we thought this was very eerie. We wanted to go back to where we saw the deer to see if it had returned. Eventually we ended up there but only after going all over different routes exploring and marveling all the while commenting about different insights we had.

It felt like some force was telling us where to go it was very strange, certain paths would just seem to be right as if they were radiating a certain kind of energy. I felt like I knew what it was like to be an animal, I had never been so in tune with my surroundings, it was just right. 
/n

Back at the grassy spot where we had seen the deer the effects began to pick up even more. I kept getting lighter, the sun felt like it was literally wrapping around my body like that feeling just a few minutes after you sit in a hot tub. We laid down again and when I closed my eyes I saw beautiful gentle closed eye visuals of a sun with radiating colors, red orange and yellow all meshing together like dropping food coloring into water. 
/n

People were walking by on side trails and it made me feel like an animal even more by the fact that we were so close by yet they had no idea we were even there. We talked about how its because there not in tune like us and too busy thinking about superficial things blah blah you get the idea. M felt content at this spot but me and C felt as if there was something we needed to reach again (there were all kinds of moments were we would reach something and it would seem as if it was the beginning of another chapter in our trip). C and I felt like there was some goal that needed to be reached, something to be found, however we were so comfortable we werent sure whether or not to move, we uncomfortably tangled with both ideas for a while and went back on the trails.

More odd things happen like we would be walking and all stop at the same time without knowing why and surely enough each time there would be a spider web with a HUGE spider on it right in front of us, every so often we would see a tree that was so amazing and beautiful for any particular reason and marvel at it. I remember seeing a flower on one of the times that was growing around a lot of dead things and this flower was the brightest yellow flower I have ever seen in my life it was such a vivid yellow like the yellow was deeper and fuller. Soon I realized I was extremely thirsty and a bit hungry. All of us decided to walk to a nearby burger place that wasnt too far. When we got to civilization it was a HUGE culture shock. The cars the people everything, it was kinda disturbing. Crossing the street was pretty hard/nerv racking, finally though we got lots of French fries and water, then Ms girlfriend who looks down on drugs shows up after he told what he was going to be doing, got in a fight and it put a negative spin on everything, we just desperately wanted to get back to the spot. 
/n

After what seemed like an exhausting walk we made it back to the spot, by now it probably had to be 5 or 6 and we were very happy to have the water. After talking and drinking water we were over the whole girlfriend thing and it wasnt depressing us anymore. The fries tasted like complete shit but the thought of an orange or some really juicy fruit sounded orgasmic. 
/n

After drinking we laid down for a bit and the effects really got stronger. The light reflecting on the leaves was going all around like fireflies and I was getting intense pulsating closed eye visuals of purple green blue white spider web flashes with lightning, and chills down my body. We just sat quietly in our own little worlds pondering everything for what seemed to be a long time (contrary to most of the trip which had been very communication enhancing). 
/n

Then after an hour maybe we began the beginning of one of the best, most spiritual, insightful, philosophical, long, inspiring conversations Ive ever had, ranking above many heavy dosed ecstasy conversations. I could not possibly write all of the things we came to realize then, the only word I can use to describe it is magical. During this conversation we all realized that we had found what we were looking for, how earlier in the day we had the strong feeling on the trails that we were looking for something but we just didnt know what it was, we felt like the mescaline was leading us somewhere well we all agreed what we were looking for was this state of mind, that the trails led us to this state of mind and how ironic is it that it came to in 'the spot' we had spent a ton of time in during the beginning of the trip. 
/n

Soon it was getting dark and after watching a whole day pass by before are eyes we new we should get back to the parking lot because there were lights there. The effects were VERY SLOWLY weaning away just as they had come on but there was still a long way to go. We were really ready to be sober again. /n The rest of the trip involved having to drive home impaired, and playing it sober in front of my parents (pretty tough, I did pretty well though, I told them I just smoked a few bowls they believed me). Took an amazing shower that sent hot vibrations all over (definitely pleasurable), and laid in my bed exhausted. my cat walked up to me sat on my side purring extremely loud, I pet him until I fell asleep and I felt extremely close to this animal and I knew he felt the same about me. finally I drifted into a heavy slumber and woke up fine the next morning

I will never forget that trip.</bodytext></report>
