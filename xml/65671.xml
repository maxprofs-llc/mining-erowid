I have used e about 15-20 times, doses ranging from 1 tablet to 4 in any one night. My body seems to react well to the 'negative' effects of MDMA/MDA/MDEA/MDxx. Not once have I had a bad comedown or ever felt remotley sad the following day. Usually I am tired, only due to the fact that I had been dancing for 5 hrs and not slept since the previous night (everyone experiences tiredness.....). I usually feel very normal and happy the day after and well into the following days. It might just be me but I have never had a 'negative' effect or experience from using e or the come down.</bodytext></report>
