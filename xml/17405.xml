I have tried a wide varieties of opiates.  From Heroin, to pills, to raw opium.

I have learned that I prefer raw opium as opposed to any other synthetic or extracted substances.  Unfortunately, high quality black tar opium is difficult to come by.  Often, I have found that much circulating opium, is incense, or at best, a poppy straw extract.  Occasionally, you are lucky enough to find a high quality gram of smokable O, but these opportunities are few and far between.  This is not even to mention the extremely inflated cost, 20 - 30 dollars a gram for quality O out here in the great lake states.  I have tried growing, but poppies are difficult to grow indoors (I don't have a house) and growing is risky.

The best way, in my opinion, to enjoy a decent opium high, is through dried poppy pods.  Granted you can't smoke pods.  You could do a water, ether, or alcohol extraction on the pods and smoke the extract. I have done this before and found it can occasionally be successful.  Using ether or alcohol and the 'hen and chicken' variety poppy, I find I can do an extraction that is equal in potency to most decent O.  But I find it is preferable and much more euphoric to grind up the pods (I use 3-5 pods).  The affect is on par, for me, with a large dose of codene, or a pair of vicoden or darvocet. I wouldn't consider it as strong as percocet as one psychonaut mentioned in another report, unless 7 or 8 pods are used. This, however, as I will mention later, is a bit too much for most people.

Smoking a little marijuana will increase the effect signifcantly, and minimizes the urge to vomit. As a consequence of the amount of weed I  smoke, I haven't thrown up on any opiate since I did a large amount of Morphine.  But back to the point.

My strongest experience was the first time I got Poppy pods ground, not whole.  I wasn't exactly sure how many grams to put in, I normally go by a certain number of pods. This method can be inaccurate, but I deal with same variety of poppy and are familiar with the shape, size, and potency of the strain. I put in what appeared to by 3-5 pods for each person, and tried to take into account that the pods were ground better than I could ever grind them.

The tea was brewed, I added modest portion of cinnamon and honey.  I find this makes the flavor of the tea most bearable.

The tea was portioned out to each person with about one cup of tea leftover.  With me was my grrlfriend and another friend, also a female.

We each drank our tea.  While we were waiting the effects to kick in we smoked a half gram of raw Opium and we smoked 5 or 6 bowls of pot.  Within 45minutes we could feel the effects coming on, I felt I could finish off the remaining tea and I did.

After another bowl or two of marijuana, the grrls were feeling extremely O'ped up, as was I.  However, they began to complain of nausea.  I was trying my best to help them to their respectable bathrooms to vomit, without making myself too sick.  It was difficult for any of us to move at all and the grrls were vomiting all over my apartment by this point.  Realizing there was nothing I could do now, I let them vomit.  I realized I had messed up and should have wieghed out the pods.

I was dissappointed in myself, normally I am more cautious when doing the dosage for someone else.  I felt a bit guilty for making them sick.  Somehow, I managed to avoid puking.  Once they were no longer ill, we dragged ourselves to my bedroom.  We spent hours lying down, feeling extremely pleasant, somewhere between sleep and conciousness.  Finally we passed out.  Since that expierence I have learned to be more careful.

Reading the other opium expierence reports, I was dissappointed to hear so many negative reports regarding opium tea.  I find Poppy tea and opium to be extremely pleasant, but regretably addictive substances.

I highly recommend opium, but respect the pod.  Don't be a slave.</bodytext></report>
