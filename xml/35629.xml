Only being a Sophmore in high school I'm definitely not an expert on any drug, however I do like to experiment with different substances every once in a while. I've smoked some weed, messed around with inhalants, dropped ecstasy a few times but thats about all. I'm from a small, southern town so gossip spreads fast and before I even thought about doing cocaine rumors that my friends and I were 'crack whores' were everywhere. Being known as the 'crack whores', or 'coke heads' really didnt bother my friends or me. It did, however, make it a hell of a lot easier to get drugs. Once people thought we did all these things, they offered. So before long a guy friend of mine asked if I was interested in trying some coke. I said sure.

Let me give y'all a little more background on myself. I'm a staight A student, I'm on the honor roll, I'm on the debate team, and in many clubs at school. I feel that if I want to try some drugs while I'm young without the funds to support a habit, without my own place with privacy to go on drug binges, and as long as my school works being taken care of, why the hell not? Maybe I'm being naive but thats how I feel.

Anyway, my friend gave me the coke one weekend and I tried it. We only had a gram between the 3 of us and to be honest, I was scared so I did the smallest amount possible really. I barely got any effects but I still had some left. So I did a few more lines (they were baby lines I know now) I felt it a little stronger. I only noticed being extra talkitive and a bit hot. After we finished the small amount of coke we had I felt okay. I wanted some more for about a minute. But because I knew that wasnt going to happen I let it go easily. A few weeks later though, I decided that I wanted to do it again. I did and this time it was amazing. I wasnt so intimidated so I did a lot more. A little less than half a gram for myself I'm guessing. I was soaring. Basically everything you expect from a coke high. I felt perfect. I was outgoing, chatty, and friendly. After that my friends and I promised to wait to do it again. Yeah...right...

2 weeks later I was getting 1-2 grams (a lot more than before) from my friend. I never used it all at one time, I was always careful not to do to much at one time though. Anyways, that was about a month ago and today I'm waiting for my friend to call me with 4 grams, I believe, for my friends and I. Maybe thats not a lot in the world of drugs (or maybe it is) but for a few southern girls thats more than I thought I'd ever want. Since I tried coke, I stopped smoking and dropping just because I figure if I'm only using coke it's okay. I know its not but I tell myself that. I dont think I'm addicted. I'm still doing my school work, still involved with my school. As I write this I look at a letter I recieved in the mail congragulating me on being accepted into a  High School Honors Society program. Its hard to say if I'm pushing my luck with this or if I'm just having fun. If one day I'll wake up addicted to coke, and failing classes or if I'll graduate, a cokehead, at the top of my class still. Its hard to say, maybe I should quit while I'm ahead...if it were that easy.</bodytext></report>
