I was geting some gum at the convienince store and I saw this package, I was going on a long car trip that nite so I figured I'd try it out. After taking the three pills from the packageing, I felt great, my sinuses cleard up I was 100 percent focused and it gave me a sort of zippy buzz, sorta like I wanna go run arround allot, long story short im goin to get more and this time im takeing 6 pills.</bodytext></report>
