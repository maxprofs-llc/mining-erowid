I was recently lucky enough to meet someone who sold me 52 dronabinol pills (Marinol, 5mg each) for $95.  Last night I took my daily dose of 10mg Citalopram (Celexa) around 6:30 pm, then took 15mg Marinol at 10:00 pm, then another 10mg of Marinol at 11:00 pm.  I had been smoking high grade fresh cannabis all day (indoor trainwreck strain), and by 11:30 I am starting to feel extremely high, and even moreso by midnight.

Overall, oral Dronabinol (Marinol, synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, aka THC) has a  much more psychadelic effect than smoked Cannabis, even when compared to strong Sativa strains of medical grade Cannabis.  When high grade cannabis is smoked after taking Dronabinol orally, an intense euphorice high is induced that has to be felt to be believed.</bodytext></report>
