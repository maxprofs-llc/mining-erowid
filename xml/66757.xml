I dont know the mg dose but basically myself and 2 friends got 2 vials of methylone recently.  One of my friends and I had shared a hit of E and were drinking lightly.  Our other friend I believe had been doing some amphetamines before meeting us.

We decided to go to a club and meet up with one more friend (sober).  Once we got in we took our hits of the methylone.  I shared a hit with my friend.  This drug should probably be taken in large dosages.  After about 30 minutes I had some warm sensations hit me but nothing spectacular.  I was also really cracked out and just wanted to move around and talk.  I am not sure if it was the E (which I had taken almost 6 hours earlier) or the methylone but I started telling my girlfriend how great I thought she is and how beautiful she is and how glad I was she was hanging out tonight.  I think it was the methylone just because of the timing of when I started saying this. This was interesting because it had a pretty profound emotional effect on me which I didnt expect.  This didnt last long though.  After an hour or 2 I was pretty much down.

I think next time I will take a full hit if not more.  I am interesting in trying this one again though.</bodytext></report>
