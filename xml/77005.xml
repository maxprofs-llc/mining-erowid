I had a truly extraordinary encounter with /n and my sauna sangha--a group of four guys who meet once a month to sauna and probe the outer limits. We've done /n together pretty regularly, and appreciate it highly. But this time, something different happened. We were sucked into another reality /n. Someplace that isn't here, but is where we also live. I smoke it alone, and have tried this experience myself--but it was our common perception. I wish I could describe it better, but I don't know how. After we drifted back from that, one fellow wanted to check into it again. He took a hit on the bong and leaned into it, and I could see rings of energy pulsate out of his body. When they hit me, I was enveloped in a totally disorienting /n experience--which passed almost immediately, just in time for the next wave to hit. This went on for a couple of minutes. I had to cut loose of trying to get dressed, and just ride the energy for a while. -- /n , TN</bodytext></report>
