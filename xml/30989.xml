Something White Something Pure
/n
Something that fucked my life for sure.
/n
I want it now I want it bad
/n
This stupid shit drives me mad.
/n
And here I go a mile a minuet
/n
This is a battle and I'll never win it.
/n
My teeth may grind
/n
My jaw might clench
/n
It is a thirst that I just can't quench.
/n
My mind is numb as is my soul
/n
And my head feels sore and full.
/n
Dreams of mine that reach the sky
/n
Dreams that only last when I'm high.
/n
Something white something pure
/n
Living life in a blur.
/n
And here it is lined up again 
/n
And a brand new bill to take it in.
/n
And some minuets where I'll feel great
/n
Living life with drugs my fate.
/n
The sun comes up and I come down
/n
And the feeling of loss makes me frown.
/n
I am sad but it will come again
/n
Why must I take this in?
/n
Feelings come and feelings go
/n
But my feelings for you continue to grow.
/n
I want to gone
/n
I want you out
/n
It is time for me to start a new route.
/n
I want to feel clean refreshed and motivated
/n
And destroy this evilness that you created.

Something white
