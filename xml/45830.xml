There are many Brugmansia trees that grow around in my neighborhood, I had heard that an experience of 'hells bells' (Brugmansia) was an awesome trip and that I would love it.  So me and my friend decided one day we should trip out on hells bells, we both had no knowledge of how many flowers we should pick off the tree, so I picked 24 flowers around 12-18 inches each flowers.

We took the flowers to my friend's house and chopped all of them up as finely as we could, put them in a pot of water and boiled the water for 30 minutes.  After the water was boiled we took a screen and put it on top of a water bottle opening so we could just drain the liquid into the empty water bottle. ( we thought it was best not to drink the chopped up part of the flowers).  After we had done that the water bottle was extremely hot so we decided to keep it in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes, and then hid the bottle under his bed.

We didn't decide to drink the hells bells (Brugmansia) until my friends mom went to bed, through out the whole day we had been drinking and we picked up 4 g's some pretty good quality chronic.

My friend's mom had finally passed out, so we took the bottle, and we were makin sure we were ready to do this and we both were.  So we each drank half the water bottle and immediately our pupils became dilated.  About 5 minutes after I drank the liquid my mouth became very dry and I had an extremely upset stomach, probably from the rum I had drank earlier that day, and ran to the bathroom and puked red chunks all over the toilet.  I felt much better after throwing up but I wasn't exactly tripping yet and I didn't know what the problem was, we still had about 2 g's of weed left so we packed 3 bowls until finally around the same time we just stopped for no reason and started wandering around my friend's house.

10:00 PM:

At this time I had very blurry vision and wasnt hallucinating yet but was basically more stoned then I have ever been in my life.  My friend and I met back up several minutes later not remembering why we stopped blazing and we went on the computer, we both could still focus but at this point it was very hard.

My friend's sister went into the bathroom (only 12 years old) and screamed when she saw red chunks of barf on the ground and in the sink and asked who threw up, my friend told me to shut up and not tell her that I threw up, so she went into her mom's room and woke her up, we thought oh shit we're caught now.  My friend's mom looked at us and asked us 'What the fuck have you guys been doing both of your fucking pupils are huge.'  My idiot friend still told me to keep my mouth shut and not say what we had been doing. At this time all the lights were on in the house but everything seemed very gray and dark, it was very hard to sit down, I remember that I kept wandering around and my friend's mom had to keep sitting me down and asking me where I was going.

She kept trying to interrogate us and told us we were both very disoriented and that if we didn't confess what we had done, she would call my father.  I still didn't confess, and at that point I was swaying my body on the couch, and she said 'nick you're tripping me out man' which me and my friend thought was extremely hilarious for some reason and we cried we were laughing so hard.

My friend's mom called my dad and told him that me and and my friend are on some type of hallucination and that I needed to be picked up.  Now from this point of time I can only describe the hallucinations that I remember, but I don't remember what actions I had done, so I will tell you what my dad and brother had told me what I was doing.

I remember my friend's mom calling my dad and at that time, I ran out of her house and I was in my boxers and socks, no shirt, or pants, just boxers and socks, wandering around the streets for god who knows why, my dad searched the neighbor hood and found me on a busy street wandering around in my socks and asked me what the fuck I was doing.  I dont remember wandering around the neighborhood but this is what my dad told me I had done, he said ' nick you had no fucking clue who I was and you didn't even know how to open the fucking car door.'

Around 12:00 PM - 8:00 AM: 
/n
My dad took me home, and I remember when I came home I started hallucinating heavily, seeing very realistic things popping up out of no where, my dad asked me if I had been on belladonna, acid, pcp, mushrooms, etc.  I told him I had only been drinking and smoking and he kept me in my room, I remember when I got into my room I saw a few of my friends who werent really there, everything was still grey and dark, and at that point I was talking to my friends Andy, John, and Nate, and I even set up beds for them to sleep in because I thought they were sleeping at my house.  
/n
/n
My dad walked in and asked me who I was talking to and I said 'well obviously who does it look like Im talking to.'  He looked at me like I was a complete idiot and said that I needed to stay in my room and not dare leave it.  I later saw my mom in my room ( she wasn't there though) and she lead me in the closet where I jumped into the closet and closed the doors.  My dad had told me the next day that he found me in my closet talking to my mom and I had my cell phone charger in my hand.  I kept seeing my brother walking into my room and he was pointing at me and laughing and I was completely scared at this point, laying under my covers and trying to get the visions out of my head, I would look over the covers to see if anyone was there and my friends would be sitting there just staring at me and I would talk to them and scream get the fuck out of my house.  At around 1:00 AM the police called my house and talked to my dad to ask if I was ok, I guess my friend's mom had to take my friend to the hospital and gave the cops all my information.  My dad said I didn't need to go to the hospital and that he was keeping an eye on me every few minutes.

At around 3:00 AM my mom finally came home from work, she got the news that I was heavily hallucinating, walked into my room and asked me why there were beds set up, and I repeated to her 'Mom be quiet, Andys sleeping.'  
/n

Between 3:00- 3:30 AM I was still seeing people.  AT around 3:45 AM I think I had to get up to go to the bathroom, and this was by far the scariest thing that has ever happened to me in my life, as I was peeing out of no where about 15-20 grayish brown spiders that were pretty small popped up in the middle of the air and were forming spider webs all around my hands, I was terrified and tried to bat the spiders away but they werent leaving, I ran into my room extremely frightened where I came to find my imaginary brother sitting in the closet staring at me.

I dont exactly remember what happened or what I saw for the rest of the night, I think I fell asleep, but at 9:00 AM I woke up.  I went to the bathroom to pee and I looked in the mirror to find my pupils still dilated, and I was trying to remember what had happened the night before.  Something very scary that happens to me on Brugsmansia is that often I see people out of the corner of my eye for about 2 minutes straight, so I am shaking my head left and right constantly to see what it is that is standing out in the corner of my eye.

I had very blurry vision, my mom and dad finally woke up and I confessed everything to both of them.  The stories my dad still tells me about what I was doing seem actually to be very funny, I really wished that I had a recorded myself on a video camera or something so all my friends could get a laugh.  My mom went to the local nursery and asked about the flower and found out that I had taken way too many flowers and could have easily died.  It was a somewhat fun but frightening experience.  
/n
/n
After I did hells bells and told my friends about the experience and told them specifically not to do it, about 3 friends tried it anyways and all ended up getting caught, they first tried doing 4 flowers one night, then 10 the next night, after they did 10 flowers they had been caught, 1 friend had been arrested for peeing on his neighbors truck. it and now I know not to do it again.</bodytext></report>
