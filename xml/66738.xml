The other night, I really wanted to smoke some weed, but I had none.  So I went looking in my herbal cabinet.  There was some yerba in there and I had read online that it's a decent high, so I packed a bowl, and lit up.

It took about 5-10 minuets to start to feel anything.  The high was very similar to weed.  I had that same feeling in my shoulders that I get when I smoke weed.  Anyway, I was concerned because after about 5 minutes, I just kept getting higher, and higher for about 15 minutes.  The only real difference between a weed high and the yerba high is that I can focus a little better, and my brain actually can function better, but I'm still really spaced out!

The next morning I still felt it!  I guess this is my new back-up weed!

Overall, a good high, good up-time, and no withdrawls or crashes!</bodytext></report>
