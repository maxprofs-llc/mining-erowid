My Datura experience was far from enjoyable. It scared the Hell out of me. I have tried many psychoactive substances, both natural and chemical. The dehydration effect was intense. No matter how much water I had, it wasn't enough. The hallucinations were of any solid surface evolviving into maleovent 'mouths' that wanted to devour me. Sleep was impossible. Music was distorted beyond discription. Video was worse. The visual distortion persisted for days after. All print or photos would seperate into a blurry 'rainbow' effect. Disorienting and potentially dangerous. I will not do it again.</bodytext></report>
