I have had a lot of history of using opiates, primarily vicodin, oxycontin, percocet, and other commonly prescribed narcotic painkillers.

I have also had much experience with the feelings associated with the withdrawal symptoms which I almost 90% of the time will be completely aware of whenever I cease to take my pills.
/n

I have no real pain, however, I purchase the pills off the street.

Recently, I have tried to quit again, and a new doctor I aquired prescribed me a patch for clonodine which lasts for 7 days straight!
/n
/n
I put it on 26 hours following my last use of opiates, and for the next 7 days I felt NO WITHDRAWAL symtoms to my awareness. It worked wonders. I have been taking Prozac for almost 6 years, and also a drug called Neurontin (for the past 3 years), both of which are prescribed to me for depression.

/n
I do not smoke, however, I chew Nicotine Gum (for the past 2 years), and I drink an average of 4 cups of coffee a day. All of which did not change when I switched from abusing opioid painkillers to the mere application of a clonidine patch.
/n

When I quit the narcotic analgesics, I also quit the habit of smoking marijuana. It has been about 15 days since that first day of being clean, and compared to other times I have tried to quit using drugs, this time has not been too hard. (although it is never easy)

/n
Before I had quit this time, I had not been physically without some sort of opiate drug in my system for at least 3.5 weeks. This has been my experience with Clonidine.</bodytext></report>
