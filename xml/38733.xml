It was around eleven pm and right in front of me lie several fat snaking lines of Cocaine. Around me were the biggest group of junkies, left over hippies, and stoners to ever crash a Seattle condo. The sounds of Jimi Hendrix's Voodoo Chile blare through the worst PA system I have ever seen in my life. It was so loud I couldn't even hear myself think, let alone this moron in front of me trying to pressure me into snorting one of these lines of coke. I've heard the rumors about this drug. The horror stories of addiction, of course. I have always told myself that I would never do any drugs, only drink. Oh it's funny how things change.

Looking around for my friend Dave (the asshole that got me into this mess) I make my way around this dumpy condo tripping over passed out drunks. Down through a narrow hallway, I call for Dave. Without any sign of him I give up and head back to the couch to sit across from the annoying coke head again, hopefully he will find me soon. Not hesitating on a great chance to further annoy me, the scragly looking guy that kept offering me the lines of coke on an old broken down coffee table leaned towards me and practically shouted, 'ARE YOU GOING TO SNORT THESE OR NOT MAN?!' Finally, just to get this jerk out of my hair I respond, 'Alright, just one though.' Without saying a word he pulls a wrinkled one dollar bill out of his pocket, slams it down on the table and rolls it up perfectly as if he had rehearsed this a million times before. He then hands me this makeshift straw and says, 'Have at it brotha!' Instead of sitting and thinking about the consequences of my action I bend over and snort an entire line, about 4 inches long.

I would say less than three seconds after I railed the line my nose started to get numb. It started from the tip of my nose and quickly spread to my entire face. Dropping the rolled up dollar I look up at the scragly coke guy. He looks back at me with a twisted little grin, as if he was saying, 'You have no idea what you have just gotten yourself into.'

About a minute of staring at each other the guy speaks up, 'Are you feeling it?' I smirk and let out a big sigh, 'Ohhhh yeaaa...' I collapsed back into the couch. The first thing I realised was a very strong sense of euphoria, sort of like taking a couple percocets but maybe three of four times stronger. I felt like I could seriously hurt anyone that tried to pick a fight with me, and I don't think I have ever had the confidence of winning a fight in my life, considering I have never won one. After about three to five minutes I felt all of the effects of this wonderful killer. Extreme euphoria, increased energy, sweaty palms, runny nose and the need to TALK!

The scragly coke head guy turned out to be a decent person when I was higher than a kite. I found out his name was Paul, and he practically made a living selling this stuff. Must have talked to Paul for an hour straight. About everything from the Seahawks to the upcoming Presidental elections. Every fifteen minutes or so Paul would offer me another line. This drug that I had been told by so many people to never try because it would quote, 'Fuck you up' actually turned out to be not that bad of a substance.

Eventually, after four lines and two hours of conversation Dave found me and wanted to leave. Paul gave me his phone number and one last line. On the way out the door I remember singing the line from the song I heard earlier, 'Well I stand up next to a mountain, and I chop it down with the edge of my hand.' I found some kind of irony in this, because it's exactly how I felt at the time. Like I could chop a mountain down. The rest of the night was absolutely wonderful, I made three new friends at Jack in the Box and went home and cleaned everything, eventually passing out around six in the morning.

I woke up at about seven at night feeling like garbage and to make matters worse I had to go to work in three hours! I ended up throwing Paul's card away. Although a wonderful drug with a high better than sex, the after effects aren't worth it. I ended up not eating anything for an entire day, falling asleep at work and battling the worst cravings ever imaginable. I can't even begin to imagine how much weight I would lose if I used this stuff for only a week, I had no appetite at all!</bodytext></report>
