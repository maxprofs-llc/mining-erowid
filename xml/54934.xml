Before I had many experiences with western theraupetics so I reasonded that in my Ayahuasca experiences,I should use a reversible MAO inhibitor like moclobemide (Aurorix) to increase the effeciency of the brew.

SO that's what I did. On two seperate occasions, I brewed P.viridis and B.caapi mixture (50gr each) and took this mixture an hour after taking two seperate doses of 100mg moclobemide.

On these occasions, while waiting for the moclobemide to kick in before the brew, I felt that my hands and mouth drying and my back starting to stiffen.(Being a pyschonaut for sometime I try to be aware of these changes as much as I can).

Nevermind, when I drank the brew I found that moclobemide really dimmed the visuals and most interestingly increased the emotional tone of the experience in mostly in a negative way. I felt much more queasy, insecure and withdrawn from my surroundings. Also I physically trembled more.

I had a similiar experience with a serotonin reuptake ACCELERATOR (tianeptine) before. At that time as well I was almost shivering down to my bones. It is very striking that moclobemide effects serotonergic systems massively. [Nevertheless, I should add that, tianeptine should not be combined with any MAOI containing drug or herb.]

My other experiences with the same batch of herbs at the same dose interval were quite mind-opening and valuable even without addition of moclobemide. So far I have found moclobemide a bad admixture to the brew that dimms valuable emotional colors.

Thank you very much.</bodytext></report>
