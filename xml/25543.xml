About six months ago I received two grams of Salvia divinorum 5x extract in the mail. Provided that the quality of the product was good, that would be enough for 15 - 20 doses. Several bowls of the extract were smoked by a few people within a couple of weeks.

I myself dosed five or six times in about a month. After that i voluntarily quit, because weekly administration of a potent short-lasting psychedelic is, for me, mostly a waste of both the material and my cognitive resources. I quickly found that all the salvia trips were in some ways alike, and that as for exploration of the mind, i could continue from where i left when I redosed. This reminds me that at the time of the experiments, i was also on nightly Calea zacatechichi, which may or may not have affected the way I handled the Salvia experiences.

I had read that it takes about two hits of 10x to really get going, so i tried to get four big bong hits of 5x when i smoked for the first time. The dosing took place on a couch in a friend's apartment. After i had taken three hits, one of the observing guys had to leave for some reason. This interrupted the event for a while, which somewhat annoyed me. After the first three hits, i was feeling quite weird. It seemed that parts of my body had become separate, like if i strached my neck, at first it didn't seem to move my head at all in relation to the rest of my body, as if the body parts could overlap each other. The head did eventually follow the neck, but with quite a delay. The physical feeling was like slowness of mass had quadrupled on me. When  I closed my eyes, there were some basic geometric CEV:s, but with opened eyes i could still see the room. After guy A had left, I managed to ask guy B to pack some more into the bong and to pour the water out. He then lit the bowl and I took the largest hit i could. After that i lost normal vision - i still don't remember if my eyes were open or closed. Psysically it now felt like it was raining inside the apartment and the raindrops were falling all over my body. I remember seeing the patter of 'rain' as a visual texture that was completely analogous to the physical sensation. As the number of drops increased, the normal world seemed to disapper into the mist.

Normal tactile sensations were also numbed during ascension, but not at the peak. At the beginning of the peak, which was at about t+0:05(counting from the first hit), there seemed to be a tunnel, through which I was going backwards at a pretty low speed. It felt more like sinking into a fluid, but there were also strong rotating forces around me that formed the tunnel. As i sank down the tunnel, there seemed to be entities of some kind on my sides - they seemed to be going down with me. I could see an alarmed jester-esque figure appearing and disappearing on my right side, and on my left side there was a pale face with black eyes and a blank look. It was like the thing on my right had access to things i've mostly kept secret even to myself - lost memories and subconscious routines that were undoubtedly part of my everyday thought processes.

In retrospect, it is quite impressive how directly a short-lasting psychedelic can work - even at heavy doses. I wasn't prepared for it at all at the time, so it mostly felt bad, because the part of me that had become the fierce entity on the right didn't want to waste any time. I don't remember if it used language, it was prorbably in enhanced internal communication code, but it still feels like i could remember occasional sentences if i really tried.
/n
I don't remember ever being as afraid as i was when the thing rapidly narrated my life from a perspective previously unimaginable to me. I couldn't really relate to the white entity on the left. It seemed that 'I' was in the middle, but still, there really was nothing in between. It felt like it was my mission to unite the two parts so that they and the additional 'me' could find my way out of the place. When the peak was over, a wooden pier seemed to appear in the bottom of the tunnel. Visual activity was very much diminished by now so instead of seeing the other side, i navigated by ideas. It was now clear how the whole thing was generated by mechanisms between different ideas, modulated by feelings and filtered by perceptive functions.

There actually was nothing new with any of the discoveries made during the trip, for example, in literature there has always been information about preconscious phenomena, it's just that they're seldom encountered in the flesh, so to say.

When I was returning to baseline i started walking around restlessly and talking. I was told that I talked about weird hallucinations that persisted into the normal world. At about t+0:15 i was completely back to baseline, but i still felt psychologically stimulated as a natural implication of being strongly influenced by a psychedelic. After this experience i've taken salvia a few times, and it has almost always been a success.</bodytext></report>
