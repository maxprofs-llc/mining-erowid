First off, I've been on drug testing for 6 months, and looking for ways to get high.  So I've been doing stuff WAY more dangerous than pot which I was put on drug testing for.  Parents should keep this in mind if they're thinking of drug testing their kids.

Anyways...I remembered I had a can of this computer duster stuff, and tried it.  I immediately got REAALY dizzy, INTENSELY Dizzy, and my voice sounded like it had been taped and the recording slowed down.  Eveyrthing sounded really tinny, like a cheap reverb on a guitar amp.  It lasted for about 2 minutes.  It was mildly amusing.  I did it a few more times just to see.

I wouldn't recomend it to anybody.  The effects are NOT worth it, huffing is BAD.  Go to the store and get morning glory seeds (oh how i love them) cause inhalents are fucking dangerous.  Nothing super bad happened to me except a pain in my chest which is now gone, but seriously, DO NOT DO THIS!!</bodytext></report>
