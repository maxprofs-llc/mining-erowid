I tried ivory wave or mdpv having previously experimented with mephedrone san pedro cactus lsa dxm among others. The powerful stimulation caught me off guard and I was racing around camden town for hours like a madman. The compulsive nature of it was terrifyingly strong. 60 MG WAS A STRONG DOSE BUT I CONSUMED BETWEEN 1 AND 1.5 GRAMS DAILY FOR A MONTH. This resulted in hospitalisation and being sectioned on a mental health ward. Vivid hallucinations and intense paranoia lasted weeks after stopping. I genuinely feared for my sanity.</bodytext></report>
