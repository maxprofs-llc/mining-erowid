My girlfriend and I purchased 25 mg of MYSTICAL SPOT REMOVER from a headshop in town around 3 pm on a Wednesday. They had .25, .5, and 1 gram containers for sale, but I knew that you only needed a little bit to get the job done, and I didn't want to run the risk of massive redosing so we decided to just get the 25 mg package.

We get home around 6 pm and we cut out a few bumps (I don't have a mg scale, but since there was only 25 mg in the container I'd say that each bump was about 2-3 mg) and waited for it to kick in. I had read up on the chemical and was aware of its harsh comedown and binging risks but I figured that since the normal/moderate dose was around 10 mg I would have no problem staying up all night on it with minimal negative comedown effects.

We started to feel it within 30 minutes and pretty soon we were feeling good. Not really euphoria, but more like an extreme need to be social and focused. We worked on homework, and watched TV, doing a bump every couple of hours until around 4 am. My girlfriend had to be at class at 10, so we did our last bumps right around 9 and left the house. And it's all downhill from here.

I've never been on a stimulant binge before so I didn't really know what to expect from the comedown. I had read about it online and there were definitely some horror stories, but they were mostly from people who were up for like a week at a time or had done a ridiculous amount, so I figured I would get a headache be a little irritable and then sleep it off. Nope. Around 10 am my chin started quivering and I couldnt make it stop, my heart was pounding, and I couldn't see straight. My eyes were watering so bad it looked like I was crying, and I was miserable. But that was just the beginning. I should probably mention that during this time I'm inside of a college campus, surrounded by hundreds of people I've never met before (she goes to a different school than me). I tried to stay in the car but I had a panic attack and didn't want to be by myself, I looked awful, people were staring at me and I was worried that someone might bring the strung out kid to the attention of campus police so I went for a walk around outside.

My voice was so shaky that I could barely talk, I was walking like a zombie, and I couldn't really figure out what was going on. Finally after 4 hours she was done with class and we headed home. (I should note that I have NO idea how she made it through class, I could barely stand to be there, let alone actually trying to be productive and function in front of people) We get back home at 3 pm, and we try to go to sleep but we can't. We are both exhausted but by this time the full effects of the comedown are hitting us. My heart is pounding in my chest and it's very hard to breathe. I can't focus on anything. My head is pounding and I'm having major anxiety attacks. Aside from stimulants I'm a pretty experienced drug user so I knew that it was just a side effect and it would go away after a bit. At 9 pm the panic attacks stop, but I don't think I got to sleep until like 3 am, I just laid there and my mind raced through every possible thing that could be wrong at that moment, and then when I did sleep I had crazy nightmares and woke up constantly cause I would start freezing or burning up.

Summary
/n
MDPV is NOT mephedrone, and the comedown is definitely not worth it.  I ended up throwing the rest of what was in the container away, something I've NEVER done before.

Approximately 10 mg kept me awake for a total of 40 hours, that's ridiculous. I'm sure it would be better if you were to only take one dose and then be done with it, but that's really, really hard to do when you start coming down and have more. Personally, I'll never do it again. It's just too much strain on the body.</bodytext></report>
