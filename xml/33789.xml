I just discovered the best way to eat nutmeg. APPLESAUCE! you can either mix your dose of nutmeg with a bowl of applesauce or scoop a spoon of applesuace followed by nutmeg followed by more applesuauce. The taste of the applesauce and its wet yet still solid texture allow you to almost totally ignore the ill flavor of nutmeg. I JUST DID THIS five minutes ago, so I havn't tripped or anything yet but the applesauce definatly helped out with consuming the nutmeg.</bodytext></report>
