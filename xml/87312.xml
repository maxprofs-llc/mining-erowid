The first time I smoked it, the experience was so much like weed that I was confident I had found a new addition to my life. Im on leave from Afghanistan, so being in the military finding an alternative that they wouldnt drug test me for when I get back seemed like the greatest thing on earth. I have been smoking give or take every day now for ten days. My experiences have been very varied depending on how I smoke Spice. Let me first state I have smoked five different types of spice. Some spice Summit, some Super Kush, some Citron, some red stuff, some blue stuff that I dont recall the name of. Every type got me high. I did notice a little difference between some of the brands, but mostly just regarding how quickly I got high. I have smoked it from two different methods. I have a single chamber water bong, and a one hitter with the whole dugout thing. I like the one hitter because it allows for hasty refreshing of my buzz, but I feel the bong is better for getting high faster, so I generally start my day with the bong.

As far as my experience, I smoked marijuana religiously for about two years before I joined the military. I drink, eh, fairly routinely. I smoke cigarettes. But have otherwise not tried other drugs. I tripped on acid once (Did not enjoy my experience), and smoked crack once (Also did not enjoy my experience).

As it compares to weed there are many similarities. The feeling of High is very close to weed. I get pretty mellow, things are funnier, music sounds better, watching Lost is like the coolest thing ever, sitcoms are funnier, and video games are just more fun. I get the munchies pretty similar to weed, some cotton mouth, Im always thirsty, and food and drinks taste better just like on weed. Taco Bell and White Castle are the shiznit. But Spice isnt weed. It is a fairly viable legal alternative, but Spice has a bit of a Dark Side that I think should be mentioned.

I experienced a few side effects that werent so great. In public places I feel way more paranoid than on weed. Sometimes to the point where it almost feels like Im going to trip out. Slightly reduced physical capability too, like Im clumsy after I smoke. Sometimes I will get an Out of body or detached feeling where it feels like Im sitting there looking at my life with some limited control over what Im doing. Unfortunately its a very dismal feeling. Perhaps my life is dismal. I wouldnt say Ive ever felt like I was dying as some people have, but I can understand what theyre talking about. It happens usually when Ive come down from the full high.

The hangover seems to last for a while. The first night I smoked and got really high, I also got fairly drunk. All in all it was a great experience. The next day at like four in the evening I still felt a slight hangover, though some of it was from the alcohol, I could feel the lethargy and just overall lack of motivation of a high hangover. To remedy this I smoked a bowl, and became like INSTANTLY high again. Admittedly I havent really been not high for more than a few short intervals in the last two weeks or so. But I can tell that the high hangover is long lasting.

I feel Spice is best for occasional use. Like once a week or less, and it should be used in situations where I dont have any real obligations that day, and preferably not many obligations the next day since I might have a crappy high hangover. And in the words of the famous Katt Williams, It is easy to get high. It is not easy to get un-high when your baby walk in the room!mI dont recommend daily use. With more frequent use I notice the hangover is worse, and the the detached dark feeling sneaks in more often. As a recommendation to anyone who freaks out in a public place (I can see how it would affect some people that way), the best advice is to calm down and regulate your breathing. Take a step outside, smoke a cigarette, etc. Also, I find if Ire drinking and high the alcohol tends to reduce freaking out as it counterbalances the paranoia. If I find myself feeling the dark side high hangover, a kinda self defeating way to fix it is to smoke more and get back to the good high again. Otherwise I recommend getting up and doing things, cause it seems like I get this feeling if I'm just sitting around doing nothing. So forcing myself to be active will help somewhat.

I notice a decent amount of anxiety and restlessness with Spice that I didnt get with weed. But I think that occurs more with overuse and wouldnt be as much of a problem if I wasnt smoking daily right now. I am currently high and feeling pretty good, but Ive got to do some cleaning and I know that is not going to get done tonight.</bodytext></report>
