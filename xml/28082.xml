Stomach still fairly full from evening meal with 2 pints of beer. It's midnight, everyone is in bed upstairs and I am alone, stretched on the sofa watching television. Feeling relaxed and slightly sleepy.

T0+40   BP 150/76 PR 75  Very stimulated alertness, yet calm and relaxed. No difficulty in concentrating or talking. Watching TV, chat show host seems quite amusing (though he isn't). Pupils not dilated, no nystagmus, no jaw clenching. Pleasant sensation overall.

T0+180  BP 130/75 PR 59  Effects almost gone. Stimulation almost back to zero. Feel a little dissapointed. Feeling sleepy and doze off watching an original Star Trek episode.

T0+240  BP 193/85 PR 153  Suddenly wake up. Overstimulated, confused and very anxious. Shit, I can't handle this! Can feel blood pressure is through the roof and heart pounding. Make myself sit up. Realise what is happening and concentrate on calming down. Can't relax and feel I am going to loose control. Don't feel co-ordinated enough to make it to phone or stagger upstairs for help.  If it gets any worse I am going to have to shout for help and an ambulance. Whole body trembling strongly. Face muscles twitching, jaws clenching, nystagmus. Gradually gain control of myself and calm down. Over 15 minutes, anxiety fades and co-ordination returns. Chest is really thumping - take blood pressure - shit, too high! Look in mirror - pupils very dilated, face pale. Mood has become very calm, euphoric and alert. Feeling cold and whole body shivering, teeth chattering. Assume this is MDMA-like affect on body temperature regulation. Worried about hyperthermia, take clothes off and stand in back garden in rain and wind at 7 Celsius for 5 minutes.

Still shivering, come indoors and wake someone for a thermometer. She thinks I have flu and fetches one. Just 38 Celsius - not going to die yet. Prepared to jump under cold shower if things gets worse. Wedding tackle shrunk.

/n
T0+260  BP 180/84 PR 142  Feeling very stimulated and yet very calm and friendly. Still shivering and teeth chattering, worried about overheating so stay bare-chested. Skin cold, armpits dripping. I drink a couple of beers to try and sedate myself slightly. It's 5 AM and my thermometer provider asks how I am. I sit at the foot of her bed and tell her what has just happened. She laughs and we chat, me through clenched teeth. I feel completely relaxed and speak very calmly and openly and joke a lot. Very interested by what she has to say. BP comes down to 160/85 after 10 minutes and 150/79 after 20 minutes. We talk for 6 hours.

/n
T0+10 hours     BP 124/82 PR 59  Pupils back to normal. Still feeling slightly stimulated and wedding tackle remains shrunken. Urine production has gone into overdrive (maybe because stopped earlier?) and piss 3 times with difficulty through shrunken member.
/n

T0+15 hours     BP 115/75 PR 52. Wedding tackle almost back to normal size. A little tired from lack of sleep but no other ill effects. Not much appetite but force a meal down and feel better for it.

I am fairly resistant to stimulants but 450 mg Methylone was too much for me. It's possible that a full stomach delayed full absorption. Very speedy with a strong serotonin component. I felt very warm towards people, mellow but alert. This large dose caused MDMA-like side effects: facial twitches, jaw clenching, nystagmus, mild hyperthermia and possible reduced kidney function. The latter 2 could be dangerous in the wrong environment. Most stimulants have a very bad effect on my wedding tackle and Methylone is no exception - I could not perform for 15 hours.

Despite the oversized dose, a pleasant and rewarding experience with no bad comedown. Next time I will stick to a single dose of 250 mg.</bodytext></report>
