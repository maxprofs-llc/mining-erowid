Under the stunted oak I waited for her
/n
the Green Lady
/n
clothed in the black of the mystified, the lost,
/n
but more truly, naked and unshriven, seeking a dying moment.
/n
/n
Under my tongue, the bitter mint
/n
above my head, invisible leaves,
/n
known only for the moonlight they intercept
/n
below my back, the green grass that saw me through my youth.
/n
/n
She came to me in a spirograph body
/n
wings twined with ivy in curliqued ringlets
/n
her fingers the thorns of roses pointed with the blood of the unworthy
/n
the edges of her smile reaching up to the stars, her teeth, barbed spikes
/n
/n
I had not expected fear, but terror came with her
/n
and tho I sought a dying moment, she showed me a dying eternity
/n
and tho I sought to bring wisdom into the real, she tore the real from me
/n
and I was no more, and in unbeing, I lost my fear
/n
/n
She made me into a mist, expanding slowly until I was all
/n
everywhere, blown by the wind of her breath
/n
into eddies and whorls within myself
/n
and it was I that her wings beat, to keep her aloft
/n
/n
She flew in me, acrobatically spinning and turning
/n
casting off parts of myself in colors I have never seen
/n
I flowed across her wings, she breathed me
/n
and I flowed through her grasslike hair
/n
/n
Soon, oh, too soon,
/n
boundries encircled me and I contracted, condensed
/n
and rained myself on the stunted oak, and dripped from it in rivulets
/n
and froze beneath it into this mortal body, clothed in black of the still
/n
mystified, but no longer lost.
