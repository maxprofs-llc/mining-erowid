Lets get right to now - twelve hours after ingestion and no sign of relief.  I am only glad that I have sanity, a wonderful partner and two lovely children, because if any one were lacking I would be entirely lost now.  The most striking aspect of this trip is the total mundanity of it in terms of aural and visual perceptions.  Very normal.  However, my tactile senses seem very acute and are causing me anxiety at the moment.  I just want my nervous system to quieten down.  I'm confident it will in time - in the next twenty four hours I'm fairly certain.  And right at this instant I am resolving to take no more silly risks with myself for the sake of 'insight' or whatever other nonsense.  Imagine, just for a moment, that this is how I will have to face the world from now on...  Am I completely stupid?  I think we know the answer to that one.  Perhaps smart enough to avoid doing anything so stupid again.

What can I say to myself twelve hours ago to stop me doing it?  I am compelled to say something - I might stop you going this same way, getting here.  I should say this - I feel absolutely dreadful at the moment.  I may feel better in twenty four hours and I may not.  At this moment neither you nor I have any idea.  And that is not much fun.
