I received a supply of librium from a foreign pharmacy. The pills were encased in foil. Upon removing them I notice they had no marking, but I took a sample dose to make sure they were what they said they were.

Mild Sedation, a general relaxation.

More Sedation, and I feel more relaxed.

Sedation has been reduced but the feeling of being relaxed has not receded.

I conclude that this benzo is decent among a long list of weaker benzos. In the doses of 75mg (3x25mg) it felt comparable to 50mg of valium or 10mg of xanax without any negative side effects. None of the Valium hangover, or the memory loss caused by xanax.</bodytext></report>
