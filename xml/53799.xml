Trip Report for June 10th, 2006

The day started out pretty normal, got up at around 10am, and had my sole meal for the day, a huge bowl of Life cereal. At around 3pm I called my friend, let's call him Jake, to make sure hed acquired the necessary stuff, and also called the other 2 participants (Shawn and Brian) to make sure we were set for the night and that it would go off without a hitch. The plan was to meet at Bryans house at around 8:45, consume the mushrooms at around 9:00 and start our trek at around 9:30-10:00. At 8:00 Im incredibly hungry and decide Ill eat a couple bananas and an orange, as well as take a couple of motion sickness pills, which seem to really help with the nausea I usually get from shrooms. I also got some essentials together in a backpack (Water, flashlight, pot, some benzodiazepines in case anybody started to have a really bad trip, a few granola bars, some Pepto-Bismol chewable tablets and a handful of lighters).

Jump ahead to 8:45, Im the first to arrive at Bryans house at almost exactly 8:45, then 5 minutes later Shawn and Jake are here and were all ready to down 3.5 grams of these vile pieces of fungus. It was quite the ritual, as everybody used a different method of ingesting them, I made tea, Jake ate them by themselves (accompanied by quite a few gagging sounds), Shawn made some cheese-toast to put them on, and Ben ground his up and put them in a cup of orange juice. It was about 9:10 when we were all finished eating/drinking.

As we all started to head for the door to start our walk, Jake realized that in his excitement he had accidentally locked his keys in his car. Not wanting to start the trip on a sour note, Shawn offered to give him a quick ride home to get his spare set./n  While they did that, myself and Bryan sat around and listened to some Talib Kweli and Krayzie Bone, chatted about his new job as well as my lack of employment. The time passed exceptionally quickly and before we knew it, Jake and Shawn had arrived back with the spare set of keys, and we were ready to start our trip. By now its about 9:30, and everybody but I was starting to feel to first effects of the mushrooms. Im usually the last to feel anything.

Bryans neighborhood is by far the trippiest neighborhood Ive ever walked through. The street itself has a lot of hills and inclines, which with the body load of mushrooms proved to be pretty entertaining. Theres also plants on both sides of the road which seem to almost hang over it, which accompanied by street lamps provide some pretty interesting shadows. We kept walking for about 30 minutes until we found a park with a huge field and on the other side of the field was a small playground, which we thought would make for a good tokeing spot, we all climbed up onto the playground and proceeded to smoke a couple joints and 1 bowl in Bryans pipe. At this point we were all very stoned.

After the session Jake mentioned that he was starting to see some CEV and a moderate distortion in his vision at which point Bryan and Shawn mentioned that they were also feeling like that. I on the other hand had yet to feel anything but the slight change in body load. About 5 minutes later, I find myself with an amazingly strong urge to laugh and burst into laughter about absolutely nothing which trigger all 3 of my friends to burst into hysterics, after wed calmed down, we started talking about various philosophical subjects, and some not so philosophical :P, things like: whether we believe in creatism or evolution, how it would be shitty to be a rock because people always step on you, about how something that can just grow out of the ground is able to make us trip out, to name a few, while listening to some trip hop (which Id never heard until that night).

I felt a sudden urge to yawn and flex every muscle in my body, which usually means the shrooms are about to kick in and at the same time noticed that there was a kaleidoscopic array of colors on top of my vision, at which point I stop talking and just start taking it all in. One of the first OEVs I got was in the clouds, at first it just looked like a jumble of letters not in any particular order, I focused on them for a few minutes until they seemed to spell out Welcome Home at which point I decided to thank them out loud much to the surprise of my friends, they didnt say anything but I sense that they wanted to know why I had just said thank you, so I explained it to them.

Across the field there were some tall bushes in somebodys yard directly under a street lamp which gave way to some interesting visuals. It appeared that there were samurai warriors and cartoon characters bursting through the bushes but could never make it all the way through, the only way I can describe it, is it looked like they were pushing through a thin piece of rubber so theyd push up against it, and make an impression on it, then bounce back, kind of like when you look underneath a trampoline when people are jumping on it. Thats probably a pretty bad explanation, but I dont know how else to put it. I also saw quite a few pictures in the clouds, like, superman, goofy and Donald duck.

I think itd been about an hour and a half when we all decided we should continue walking. While we walked across the field I got the most amazing sensation, almost like I was walking on clouds. As we walked across the field we noticed that the moon had come out and it was a full one at that, we stopped and just looked at it completely awe struck with its beauty, how it commanded everybodys attention, there was a cloud hanging just above the moon, which seemed to have a lot of faces looking down on us, almost watching over us, which gave me a great sense of security and euphoria.

We decided wed make a big circle around Bryans neighborhood to arrive back at his house and watch a movie. After walking for about 15 minutes I suddenly got a urge to be closer to the nature around us, so I started walking through the trees, it felt like they were pushing me along, guiding me way through them, at first I thought it might seem weird to my friends but I felt like I got a telepathic message from all 3 of them saying We understand, do what you need to do. After walking through the bushes and trees for a while, I noticed that on the other side of the trees, there was a park, which seemed to be completely hidden from everything, it felt like I had x-ray vision and could see the park in its entirety without going all the way through the bushes. I told my friends about it, and we all climbed through and sat down on a bench.
/n
/n
As I looked around I noticed that there didnt seem to be any direct pathway into this park, it felt like it had come out of nowhere just for us. Bryan decided to pack up another bowl and we just sat in completely silence apart from the occasional flick of the lighter, when it was my turn, as I hit it, I felt like I could inhale an infinite amount of smoke and without realizing it, cashed the entire rest of the bowlwow, I felt like such a dick, so to make up for it, I decided to pack a bowl as well. After the second bowl we just sat there taking in all the visuals, it was now that I started to feel very different then Id ever felt before while shrooming. I felt like I didnt exist, like I was everything, a complete loss of individuality, I felt like I could read everybodys thoughts, like I knew what anybody I thought of was doing, like I could communicate with the plants around us. It sounds horrible, but it felt like my soul had separated from my body and fused into everything. I was everything.
/n
/n
I dont know how long this went on for, but it seemed like an eternity and I didnt want it to end, I dont remember too much after this in detail, we walked back to Bryans house, not talking very much as we were too busy thinking and watching things around us melt and morph into different things. We got to Bryans house at around (I think) 1:00am, I had a hard time reading the clock, the numbers kept twisting and moving around. To our surprise Bryans grandmother was still awake, which didnt really matter, because weve gone to his house while tripping before and she knows we know what were doing.

We then headed downstairs into the basement and popped in a DVD Jake had rented earlier in the day, called Waking Life. While watching the movie, I couldnt help but feel like I was in a lucid dream. About 2/3 of the way through the movie I could tell I was coming down and by the end, I wasnt tripping too much anymore, just some tracers and I still had quite a pleasant body stone. When the movie ended, Jake, Shawn and I all thanked Bryan for letting us walk around his neighborhood as well as letting us watch a movie in his house.

During the drive home, I didnt have any music on, I just sat and thought about the nights events, and how I was lucky to have such great friends who all shared the same passion and appreciation for magic mushrooms. When I got home, I decided to have a bowl of cereal and a banana, and threw on the cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland and smoke a couple of bowls in my Vapolution which, to my surprise, brought quite a few visuals back. After watching the movie I decided I fall asleep listening to music, so I put on The Best of Bob Marley and the Wailers, and dozed off.

I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed and energized, contrary to how I usually feel after a night of shrooming (tired, worn out, headache, lethargic). This was by far the most spiritually enlightening trip Ive ever experienced, I felt closer to my friends then I ever had before and gained a new perspective on life, to live every moment like its youre first and last. One of my favorite quotes from Waking Life, one which I really understand and enjoyed was when Guy Forsyth said: The worst mistake that you can make is to think you're alive when really you're asleep in life's waiting room.

This trip report was written a couple of days after the trip, so I may have left some parts out, and it definitely doesnt do justice to the way it actually felt.</bodytext></report>
