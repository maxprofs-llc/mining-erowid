6-apb (benzo fury) held great promise but was way short of the mark. One hour after taking a 150mg pill I felt mild sensations and a sense of weirdness. No euphoria or heightened empathy.

Another hour after taking another 150mg pill I felt mildly euphoric and still a bit weird. Penis doesnt function at all on 6-apb - girlfriend not happy.

Another hour on and theres a strong feeling of sickness that lasts for an hour, and then after the feeling is always in the background. Feel like I could get off my face with this, but I certainly dont want to ingest any more and I dont feel like snorting it.

The whole experience was a bit of a disappointment. I try smaller doses an see if the subtle effects are worth it, otherwise the lot is going in the bin.</bodytext></report>
