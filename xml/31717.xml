I'd like to share my experiences on the above combination.

Taking 5HTP with speed tends to make the body rushes more intense and me less 'wired' and anxious than speed alone. An odd side effect is I tend to go to the toilet more often (number 2). Speed alone puts me in a 'study' kind of mood when I take it on my own, but this does something else. The body rushes feel like something between a sexual climax and being in 'limerance' - the lustful, passionate feelings at the beginning of relationships. This lasts for about 5 hours, tapering off a few hours later.

Let me warn you that this experience is not for those with weak self-control. After trying it a few times, I was hooked and it took the best part of a year to break the habit. Very addictive. I don't want to encourage others to try this, as it will probably  cause more harm than good in the long run. Try it at your own risk.</bodytext></report>
