During July of 2006 I was subjected to an over the seas exchange at Oxford, England where I stayed and studied philosophy and psychology at Pembroke. During the duration of the program all the students spoke of absinthe, absinth, absintha, ect. I took great interest.

My friend, and I visited the Duty free shop where after a grin and a quick, 'are you thinking what I'm thinking,' I wrapped my grubby little fingers around Aphrodites neck and escorted her in the most loving and lustful manner. The 50cl bottle of Sebor absinthe cost me about 20 British Pounds (at the time a little less than $40), and the woman behind the counter looked at me and asked whether or not I was heading to the states. I answered yes and she informed me that if found with it, it would be removed from my person, and I would be sent on my way.

Nervous with nothing to lose besides my precious little green friend my friend and I hurried to the bathroom considering the no drinking policy in the airport, and the chance of losing the fairy to the men in blue. I grabbed a handful of sugar packets on my way knowing that the taste was supposedly foul, and we locked ourselves in a stall and nervously tore open the sugar packets and lined our mouths. I cracked it open and took a swig, and pure euphoria over came me, mind you more of from the taste, not the drink itself. I have never been a fan of black licorice, but when the fairy embraced me in her green mist, my mind was immediately swayed eternal. I handed the bottle to my friend, and he took a gulp gagging it down in 3 sips. As I watched him I could literally feel the absinth trickle down my throat, and pool in my belly. I could feel everything in my body as if watching a liquid glowing in an x-ray. After my friend was done I took another swig without the sugar and felt the same sensation. I packed the bottle away and we headed to our planes to part ways for who knows how long. With a firm handshake we said our goodbyes chuckling about our celebration.

As I walked away noticing the airport was steadily warming to an uncomfortable degree. I began removing layers as I was surrounded by a pleasant and most welcomed buzz on my way to my plane. Everything glowed with a warm sensation, as if cuddled up at home with a classic by a warm fire. My mind became stressed with thoughts of being caught and I continuously fuddled with my bags still uncomfortable warm, but intensely happy. You could say paranoid, but with a positive attitude. As I walked past I viewed the tarmac under my plane and noticed it teeming with workers and decided, what a perfect time for a going home snapshot for the family and the album. After I pulled out the camera and prepared to take the picture I realized there was no one on or around the tarmac besides and empty luggage truck being pulled past. I recognized this as my first possible hallucination, although due to the low thujone concentration, a possible misconception brought on by the stress of getting home, and/or being caught.

Once on the plane I awaited take off, and once in the air I felt as if I was one of the astronauts blasting into space. My seat belt was the only thing holding me down and there was no such thing as gravity from my perception. I was soon asleep after 30-45 mins of my absinthe experience.

6 hours later I landed and had another hallucination. I do not believe that absinth lasts this long, for I felt no other effects despite it is very likely it was out of my system. I believe it may have been possible that because I slept the entirety of the trip with body processes slowing/shutting down/changing processes during sleep that maybe it is possible chemicals remained in my system? Just my hypothesis, the same as if you drink, or smoke cannabis, and wake up the next morning still high, or drunk. Anyway, as I was walking through customs I saw EVERYONE being searched at customs, and I began to spas out a little. Walking quickly and as inconspicuously as possible I went into the restroom, changed and secured the bottle in my old clothes slowly realizing my entire bag smelled of anise, as well as my clothes. Customs turned out to be no trouble at all and the line where I had seen everyone being searched was unoccupied. This is a documentation of the final day of my journey as written in my journal riding home.

I have since finished the bottle and have always felt the same feelings, mentioned above whilst lacking in paranoia. Ever setting has been quiet and comfortable more often than not accompanied by friends. In the end I will leave it to you to determine what brought on my hallucinations, and in my concluding statement I will sum up that the absinthe gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling it also gave me a more active imagination, and sweet dreams on the plane ride home</bodytext></report>
