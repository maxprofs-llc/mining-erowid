A few weeks ago a female friend of mine told me about mugwort, a herb she said promotes lucid dreams. I looked it up, and discovered that indeed, mugwort contains thujone, the active ingredient in absinthe. Me and a few friends decided to try it out.

We mixed it with cannabis and smoked a large bowl, between five people. The mugwort causes a 'face-melting' feeling similar to taking a large hit of weed, but this fades quickly. I became drowsy and calm. It was a very nice, clearheaded high. I always have lots of CEV's, no matter what drug I do, but these were definitely sharper and flowed better. It also had a mild aphrodisical quality on me.

It seems to complement weed really well. Probably great for a bowl just before bed.</bodytext></report>
