Recently I've found that chamomile tea is a rather potent relaxant. I picked up some bulk tea bags from a local dry goods store (like a natural food store, but way cheaper.) I've been steeping one tea bag in a mug (approximately 15 oz.) of hot water (really hot, but not boiling.) I leave the tea bag in the water,  wait five minutes, and drink the tea, not removing the bag until it's all gone. It's like being comfortably stoned, with a nice body high, and a clear, sedated mind. I've found chamomile a helpful substitute for cannabis and alcohol. It helps alleviate jitteriness and encourage a deep, relaxing, and restful sleep. In the spectrum of substances that I ingest, frequently and occasionally alike, chamomile has become a useful tool for rest, relaxation, and recovery.</bodytext></report>
