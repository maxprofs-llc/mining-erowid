I have suffered from migraine headaches (light sensitivity, light pulsing across vision, pain, vision loss) since I was an adolescent. Nothing has ever worked, NOTHING. I've had debilitating 36 hour bouts with these headaches.

Now I take 3-5 of the seeds when I perceive an onset (or during) and away it goes. Now after 2 years, on ocassion 3 might not do, so I take one HB woodrose in addition to 3 and GONE! The side effect is clearer thoughts, creativity, and a sense of well being.

That has been my experience and I hope it can help you too. Lastly I hear LSD is good for cluster headaches (migraines) so I guess it stands that pre threshold amounts of LSA work too. I've never had the LSD.</bodytext></report>
