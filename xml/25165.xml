July 4th, 2003
/n
24 mg of 4-Ho-DIPT (4-hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine hydrochloride, Iprocin)

It is the Fourth of July and no freelance fireworks are allowed in my town due to the significant drought the state is experiencing.  So to celebrate the United States freedom from oppressive English tyranny, my friend M and I figured we would try a compound that is new to us both.  That material was Iprocin.
/n
/n
Determining the dosage was a little difficult.  Although I strongly believe in starting off with lower doses of compounds I am unfamiliar with for obvious reasons, it was Independence Day and I wanted a trip to remember.  Yes, I could have chosen a substance I was already familiar with but I have been rather set on trying Iprocin for some time.  I acknowledged that my actions carried great risks and I accepted them.
/n

Based on Dr. Shulgins /n in the book TIHKAL, twenty-milligrams was the maximum suggested dosage.  But Ive heard a few first-hand stories from people who adamantly suggested and recommended that we take an extra four-milligrams or so because, they claimed, it would make a dramatic and positive difference.  Also, Shulgin seems to be conservative in his dosage recommendations for many materials.
/n
/n
Instead of doing the smart thing and dosing on the side of caution, we decided to play dangerous and go with the slightly higher-than-recommended dosage.  One individual told me that his twenty-milligram experience was amusing and pleasurable but unmemorable, but that an experience with twenty-four milligrams was of a much different nature and a plus-four occurred!
/n
/n
Considering Shulgin mentioned ten-milligrams to be basically without activity, fifteen to produce moderate effects, and twenty-milligrams enough for a dramatic plus-three, it did not surprise me that a seemingly tiny bit more might be enough to reach even deeper and more complex worlds.  At first, we were bigheaded and decided on taking twenty-six milligrams, but we settled with a more reasonable twenty-four milligrams after careful thought.  I was extra careful when I weighed the powder.  I triple checked everything including the /n and /n weight of each capsule that the power is placed in.  You cannot ever be too careful!
/n
/n
We both wanted to find a nice, quiet and private spot to have the experience, so we decided to dose the drug after we began our walk, figuring we had a long walk ahead of us and I had read the trip might begin within fifteen minutes of ingestion.  We ended up deciding on the same spot where I had my /n last month.  It is a very isolated area with some unique energy.  We knew a long walk was ahead of us so we loaded up with water and took a few cans of ginger ale.  I also grabbed some pot just in case.
/n
/n
Along the way, we stopped at a frog-infested pond to take a rest.  I took a stick of incense and prayed over it.  M did the same and then I lit it and walked around to cleanse the area of bad thoughts and release the smoke as an offering.  Then we each took our pills.  Suddenly, after we'd swallowed them, this group of individuals came along and loudly proclaimed their intention to ignite fireworks.  That was our message that it was time to go.   M and I did not want to be anywhere that the police would soon show at so we continued the walk on to our spot.
/n
/n
Although neither M nor I had a watch, it could not have been more than fifteen minutes until we both announced we were feeling it.  For M, he said it was warmth or energy emanating from his arms.  For me, the energy came from my chest or heart.  Unlike the energy from LSD, or members of the 2C family that I am familiar with, with this was not at all stimulating.  It was almost relaxing in a way.  Soon, it somewhat reminded me of the kind of intoxication mushrooms initially produce, but it was not quite as buzzy.
/n
/n
After I felt the initial alert, and subsequent feeling of a mushroom-like body-buzz, the trip took on some characteristics that I remember noticing in 5-MeO-DiPT.  Admittedly it has been over two years since I have tried that substance, but I still remember it well.  I experienced a similar mental state, as well as the visual and tactile enhancement I remembered in 5-MeO-DiPT.
/n
/n
The main difference between this and 5-MeO-DiPT was that Iprocin thankfully lacked any negative body-energy, body-load or anything for that matter that did not feel right or that I could possibly complain about.  However, this phase did not last long and the material soon produced feelings and took on aspects that were unfamiliar to me and clearly unique to the Iprocin.  The drug rapidly advanced in intensity once I got out of the 5-MeO-DiPT phase of the trip which lasted for perhaps five minutes.  At this point, it was approaching a gentle and plus-two in general intensity.
/n
/n
Everything soon took on a warm orange tinge, and I seemed to be able to see more clearly.  Mild trails were developing and I felt a general overall trippy feeling, which I must admit is an awfully vague description, but thats all I can come up with folks.  I also experienced what has been termed unmotivated smiling and I think conversation at that point with non-tripping folks would have been difficult.  There was also some difficulty in walking.  My limbs felt a little heavy and I seemed slightly inebriated.  M noticed this as well.
/n
/n
We finally reached our spot by the stream and we sat down on a rock.  M and I turned to each other and exchanged a big hug without either of us initiating it.  We just both knew.  It seemed we simultaneously experienced a feeling of empathy for one another and we hugged almost as if by instinct.  I thanked him for being my friend, and he said he was thinking the same thing.  After this point, words between us were becoming unnecessary.  We were very connected to each other and both now at a full and rolling plus-three.
/n
/n
From this point of the trip on we both experienced many, many deep moments of profundity, oneness with god/the universe, and blissful out-of-body experience.  Iprocin was amazing in its utter intensity, yet it was never overwhelming like LSD.  I recall one moments when my sense of ego/self completely dissolved away and I simply became one with the rock and forest I was sitting in.  There was no thinker to experience or evaluate the moment as it happened, rather it simply occurred and I was only able to realize what had happened after all was over.  My energy began to vibrate at the same level of the rocks, stream, etc and I was simply became a part of it all.  There was complete and total oneness with everything.  It was utterly amazing and beautiful.
/n
/n
In several instances, M would have an out-of-body experience, only to hear me say wow because I was having it too.  I know we connected on this trip in a very special way.  I cant claim that everything I experienced happened to my friend, or vice versa, but there was a definite and undeniable connection to what we both were experiencing.  Again, true oneness.  There were no negative effects at all to speak of.  No tummy rumbles (nausea), no uncomfortable body energy, no digestive problems.  I felt great.  I also never experienced any of the tremors reported in TIHKAL, and neither did M.  Interestingly enough, I do get them with 4-Ho-DET and 4-AcO-DET.
/n

Around what I estimate to be two hours into the experience, we both smoked some marijuana and that really kicked things up a notch!  After that, I was out of body for a least a good half-hour.  I couldnt realty communicate.  I was simple absorbed in the energy of the forest and was at one.  M reported the same thing.  Because we were in the dark, we never really got to explore the visionary potential of Iprocin.  Most of the visions were very internalized and occurred with eyes shut.  We elected to move on to a different spot to see what the visionary properties were like.
/n
/n
Along the way, we walked underneath this bunch of trees and both of us stopped.  At that point, both M and I experienced perhaps the most powerful out-of-body experience of the night.  We stood there for at least five minutes under the canopy of trees simply taking in the energy of the forest.  Being one with the trees.  We existed at one with the universe as well.  It was a blissful experience.  No word were ever said, but we both moved on after we came back to out bodies.  I am convinced we went to the same place.
/n
/n
The walk on the bike trail home was blissful.  We were both in utter ecstasy for what we were privileged enough to experience by the stream and under the canopy of trees.  We also finally got time to explore the visionary properties because the bike trail had many lit tunnels under the roads.  Iprocin was not the most visual material Ive tried, but there seemed to be more to them than the reports in TIHKAL made out to be.  They reminded me of DPT visuals, but with a unique look of their own.  The walls of the tunnel would bend and contort.  I was moving my arms around to look at the trails, and M said as my arm moved this made the sides of the tunnel move with it.  There was also an audio component to it.  Lots of ringing and what I call tryptamine noises.
/n
/n
By the time we got home, a little over three hours had past.  We for down for the most part, save for a few lingering trails.  We spent the remainder of the evening recalling the blissful events of the day, and smoking some nice pot.  Sleep came easily around the seventh hours of the experience.  No problems getting to sleep at all.  Iprocin was very easy on the body

I must say I am highly impressed with Iprocin.  It was much more than TIHKAL seemed to make it out to be, but then DiPT was as well.  I will even go so far as to name this my favorite synthetic tryptamine so far.  It had the power to take me out of my body, but there was no fear attached as there can sometimes be with LSD, 4-Ho-DET, 4-AcO-DET, and DPT.  All in all considering the intensity, it was really a very gentle substance and again so easy on my body.  Two thumbs up for me and I look forward to working with the material again.  I will probably go twenty-milligrams next time to see what I can get out of it.  Once Ive had a full psychedelic experience with a material and I learn its language, I am usually able to milk a lot out of smaller dosages.  This was one of the best trips I have had in some time and I thank the universe for granting me what I experienced.  This psychedelic enthusiast is very impressed!</bodytext></report>
