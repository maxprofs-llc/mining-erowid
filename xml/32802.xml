Sneakin around in my dad's stuff, and there you have it!  A pill bottle that says may cause drowsiness!  Triazolam (halcion) is what it said and it said take one every night for sleep.  I did it a couple of times and noticed some good things and some bad things.

First up, the good news:
/n
- On a dose of just one pill, I got a very mild buzz and a slightly mild feel of relaxation.
/n
- On a dose of 2 pills, I noticed and greater buzz: things were more wavy and my head was heavier.  I got more of a relaxed sleepy feeling.
/n
- On a dose of 3 pills, I noticed a very nice buzz much like the buzz I get with 10mg or 20mg of Ambien. Its Like the buzz I would want to have taking it as a psychedelic.  But after about 20 minutes of fun, its sleeping time.  It makes me really tired.

Now, the Bad news:
/n
-  Triazolam makes me tired and sleepy
/n
-  It takes about 30 - 45 minutes to kick in. (that is normal though)
/n
-  I must take it on an empty stomach or I will not feel any buzz at all!  I will just feel tired...

Well, that's my experience of Triazolam, it is not something I would like to take for enjoyment.  Yet, it makes a wonderful sleeping pill and I wake up nice and relaxed by morning!</bodytext></report>
