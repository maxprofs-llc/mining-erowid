Hey guys, just wanted to share my blissful experience.  My parents were out for the whole day, and I thought that it would be a great opportunity to get 'high'.

I was in a fairly good mood that day, I decided to invite my mate over and share a spliff or two.  We smoked a joint around 12pm, and I was feeling great. Unfortunately my friend didn't feel so good, and later regurgitated most of his lunch into my basin. :(

At 2.30pm I decided to smoke a cone of weed in my bong.  I ripped the cone with ease, and felt the smooth smoke running through my body.  I felt great.

My friend left at 3pm.  By this time the effects were wearing off. I was coming down, but I wanted to relax more, so at 3pm I poured myself a glass of Jim Beam.  After finishing the glass I felt rather happy.  I decided not to drink any more. I find that when I drink after smoking, the effects of the weed is less obvious.

I've always had a liking for diazepam, and I had some left over from a past injury.  I popped two 2mg Valiums with water at 3:30pm and sat down at my computer.  I was feeling great, and the familiar numbness and peacefulness of diazepam was kicking in.  For no good reason (perhaps a suicidal urge?), I decided to take another 4 valiums and two pain killers (20mg codeine).

These 6 tablets were taken at relatively short intervals, 5 minutes between each Valium, and 10 minutes between the pain killers.  I was in for quite a ride.

My whole body seemed to assimilate with my computer chair.  I attempted to chat with my friend, but my fingers felt as heavy as lead.  I didn't want to upset the equiliberum of my body.  My mind started wandering and my eyes started to close.  I tried to stay awake, because I had to make myself pasta for that night.  My typing was absolutely incoherant, it took me multiple attempts to relay any messages.  My friend continually told me to 'go to sleep', but I thought that would be boring. What's the point in doing drugs if you concsciously experience it?  I decided to turn the computer off and make my way to the couch.
/n

With great effort I walked to the lounge room, turned on the TV and slumped down onto the couch.  I have no memory of what I was watching, but the sounds that I heard were comforting.  I felt very relaxed and nearly fell asleep.  I rolled off the couch, crawled to TV and turned it off.  I slid across my cork floor, on my stomache, into the kitchen.  I pulled my self up and almost collapsed when I stood up.  I made a mental resolution to pull myself together.  I managed, anazingly, to make myself pasta and a meat sauce.  I ate this, then, in an absolute dreamlike state, made my way to my bedroom.  I turned on my amp, started up a GoA Trance CD, and lay down on my bed.  The music had new meaning, I felt it pulsating through my body. Then I think I passed out.
/n
/n
The next morning I woke up at 5 am in a slight state of confusion, I couldn't think what day it was, and I had difficulty remembering how I got to my bed.  I went back to sleep, woke up at 10 and found myself in more sober state.  The Valium was still in effect, but only mildly.  I pieced together the last day with little trouble.

That same day I felt fantastic, I hadn't had such peacefull sleep in years, and I was filled with energy. I have never felt so good in all of my memory.

OK, diazepam seems to exaggurate the effects of alcohol greatly.  The major effect of the diazepam though, was putting me to sleep.  I don't believe that the cannibus had much effect in the long run, but who knows?  Cannibus may have added to the experience, but the effect wasn't obvious.

I would reccomend this mix to anyone, but please be carefull about the amounts of the drug that one takes.  It can't be stressed enough that drugs affect people in different ways.  Please be very carefull.

Also note that these drugs were taking over a long period of time. Time is undoubtably a key factor in the outcome of a trip.
