Well, the day started off with me mixing 10 mg of oxy into a 2 shots of vodka. It was fine, not feeling anything too special but being cautious I ended up waiting about 2 hours to see if anything happened. Well all it did was get me more drunk with less alcohol, and I have high tolerance.

After 2 hours passed I take 20 more mg of oxycontin and start to drink vodka, after about 30 min I'm feeling a mixture of drunkness and euphoria. I've had around 200ml of vodka at that point. At this point I take some adderall, don't really know what it did since it was the first time I tried it but I received an energy boost shortly after taking it. I continue to drink and ended up with around a half litre and being tipsy, which is a great thing for me since it takes much much much more alcohol for me to feel tipsy.

This was a great way for me to feel alcohol again and I loved and cherished every moment of it.</bodytext></report>
