NOTE:

I am not in anyway, shape, or form a spiritualist. My use of entheogens and other mind altering substances is strictly recreational. I am not trying to achieve a higher state of mind, nor am I attempting to discover 'god(s)'. Simply, I find the use of psychotropic substances to be an interesting and safe way to spend an afternoon.

The setting was my apartment on a lazy fall Saturday. After my girlfriend left for work, I went to the gym for a light workout. I find that keeping my body in good condition and the healthy dose of endorphins offers better highs, trips, and experiences with these substances. After working out, I drank two glasses of water with lemon.

It would also be wise to note that when I use any entheogen, I fast for the 12-24 hours before dosing. The last thing I had to eat was salmon around 6pm the night prior. I dosed the Cannabis and Kratom around 1pm.

I went in the living room, layed on my back, and closed my eyes for a while. After a short nap, I went into the kitchen and cooked 1 gram of Cannabis in olive oil for 10 minutes, let the oil cool for a moment, then I drank the resulting 'bud oil'. I chased it with another glass of water and lemon.

I then threw some laundry in the dryer and began preparing the Kratom. I put the kettle on to boil while I placed 2 grams of 10x Kratom extract in gelcaps. After the kettle whistled I put another gram of Kratom in a coffee mug and poured the hot water in the mug. I swallowed the gelcaps while I waited for the Kratom tea to cool. After stirring the tea for a while I placed an ice cube in the tea and drank it slowly. I then went into my bedroom and layed down for a while.

20 minutes after consuming the cannabis and ten minutes after consuming the Kratom I began to feel a little drowsy. This is not surprising since I've found that with my biochemistry, cannabis and some stimulants (caffeine, nicotine, etc.) cause me to become mildly lethargic. A few minutes later, I even felt sleepy.
/n

I closed my eyes, and for the next 15-20 minutes I slowly felt the Kratom come alive. It started with an overwhelming feeling of indifference: I didn't feel like getting up to fold the laundry. Even though I wanted to, I couldn't rouse myself to get up and drink the remaining gram of Kratom. 
/n

I simply layed on the bed letting my mind wander for an hour. I had trouble keeping my eyes open, but I never fell asleep. I was so content being lazy and useless, I can only imagine that this is what those Chinamen in opium dens felt like. I could see myself (if I had a steady supply) laying in bed, doing nothing but eating Kratom and watching my beard and nails grow. The Kratom/Cannabis combination provided a very strong body high.

When I finally did get up to fold the laundry and get more tea, I found it somewhat difficult to walk and maneuver myself around the apartment. I put the kettle on again and folded the laundry. As I did so, I drew up a bath. I then made some tea with the remaining 1 gram of Kratom and took the kettle into the bath with me to get the water extra hot (I take very hot baths/showers). I then sipped the Kratom tea while I sat in the bath.

Although the combination of eaten Cannabis, Kratom, and a warm bath was one of ineffable bliss, I wouldn't recommend it. I began to slip into an almost sleep/dreamlike state, and if I would have slipped under the water, I don't know that I would have made any effort to pull myself out. My body was enjoying a throbbing warmth that lasted long after the bath water had lost its temperature. I stayed in this stupor for almost an hour before I 'came to' and realized how long I'd been in the tub and 'out of it'. It was wonderful. I couldn't help thinking of the Euphio Question, a short story by Kurt Vonnegut, in which a group of people experience a state of bliss so strong, they don't even notice that two days have passed and they are freezing to death.

I, with pruned fingers and droopy eyelids, stagger out of the tub and dry off. I then get in my car and go to visit my folks. At this point I've come down for the most part and I find I'm a little foggy cognitively. Driving probably wasn't a good idea, and meeting parental figures for dinner might have been a bad idea as well. Although I feel a little foggy, I also find I can't shut up and I talk extensively with my folks about everything. My mother even asks if I'm drinking caffeine again.

Overall I find the Cannabis Kratom experience to be very favorable. I just ordered some more Kratom and I think I will do a smaller dose next time (probably stick with 2 grams of the 10x). For those who are looking for an opiate like experience, I can't help you because I have never done opiates before. The closest thing to what I experienced on the mental level was when I was on a demerol drip, but demerol didn't have the body high this experience did.</bodytext></report>
