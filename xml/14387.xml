After a week of back pain I finally broke down and wanted to try some of my friends pills. This was the first time I have tried this drug and I wasn't sure what to expect. So I watched some TV and left the pills on the counter. I just wanted to look at the pros and cons of taking a pill I knew nothing about.

That's it!!! I couldn't stand it anymore. I had to numb this pain. I am a regular user of MDMA and just like everything else you should know your source and your body. So I split the pill and took half.

No adverse reaction no pain relief either. I take the other half and go down to the spa hoping that the pill might kick in. Damn there were some hot chicks in the spa......

Out of the spa and walking back to the house I felt a little out of the norm. Almost like a mild drunkness but not anything that was worth noting.

These pills suck they don't do much. Or so I thought. So I took my second pill. As I was watching TV I suddenly realized that I was going into a dreamy phase. Things were still normal. I would say that they reacted very slow.

Second pill is going pretty well. I am feeling no pain and I feel totally relaxed. I got to the point where TV was no more fun so I left for bed. I was out in a flash.

The only other thing I can compare my experiance to is taking two shots of nyquil. I mean I felt more relaxed and less drowsy but overall it was the same affect. I would recomend that you take the prescribed amount and if you are getting some from a friend start off with one and split the second tab. Better to be safe than sorry.
