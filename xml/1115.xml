So, a few of my friends had been doing Ephedrine to get that famous body buzz, and my friend 'J' heard about it.  He decided that it would be cool to try it.  It was for a while, until he decided to do about 13 pills right between classes.  That night, we were back at the dorms, and J suddenly fell to the ground, writhing in pain.  All of his muscles were fucked up, none of us knew what to do.  It was pretty scary, but he got over it in about 1/2 hour.  Just warning you...Ephedrine might be fun, but don't do too much of it.</bodytext></report>
