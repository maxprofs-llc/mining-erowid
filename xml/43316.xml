One day, SWIM got some 2C-T-4 and found himself in the mood to try it out. This is what he experienced. Most of the report was written live during the experience.
/n
/n
7:30pm: Ingestion of 4mg (another 1mg waiting). Stomach half-full, bloodstream clean except for caffeine (the usual state after a day at work). Had a small amount of psilocybin the day before; cross-tolerance possible.
/n
/n
8:20pm: Additional mg has been consumed a few minutes ago. Hardly any effect noticeable - ingesting another 5mg for a total of 10.
/n
/n
9:00pm: Something's coming up. Minimal color changes, excited tingling in the stomach. Slightly stoned (when I turn my head, the world seems to 'jump' instead of moving smoothly; an effect that will go away later). Let's see what this will develop into.
/n
/n
9:30pm: Take-off! Pupils somewhat dilated. I'm chilling without a reason. Euphoria building up. np: 'Make Love' by Daft Punk. Marvellous song. 2C-T-4 is great so far. Could this be a dance drug?
/n
/n
10:15pm: This rocks. 2C-T-4 is indeed a music and dance drug. I just HAVE to move my body. Visual perception is changed very subtly; mostly color shifts. The material is somewhat psychedelic, but not that much. It doesn't seem specifically empathic either. As usual on mild psychedelic trips, I like talking to people, but only about fun or interesting topics. DON'T ask me how to fix whatever little computer problem you're having just because I happen to work with computers for a living. I've come to hate that kind of conversation (happens to me a lot online). (Nothing of this is happening right now, I'm using this to illustrate my current mood.)

10:17pm: Out of nowhere, one of my all-time favorite songs by John Scofield begins to play (gotta love the shuffle function). I am caught off guard and rolled over by a wave of euphoria, so strong I have to stop typing for a second. Wow. This is THE music drug.
/n
/n
10:24pm: I'm sweating and freezing alternatingly. Or both at the same time? Interesting observation: Music over headphones is no good at all. Pumping speakers is where it's at. T-4 wants to feel the body punch, not just listen through the ears.
/n
/n
11:00pm: I notice I'm very lucid. I can think and talk almost normally... I just don't really want to do either. I want to DANCE. Next time, I'll take this in a club. Hot and cold flashes continue - a weird feeling, but enjoyable. Mouth fairly dry. No unpleasant side-effects so far.
/n
/n
11:30pm: I'm hungry and thirsty the whole time, seemingly no matter how much I eat or drink. Still listening to my all-time favorites playlist and feeling GRAND. Acoustic and electronic music equally enjoyable. Pupil dilation not detectable anymore; maybe it wasn't even there in the first place. 
/n
/n
12:15am: For its relative sobriety and clearheadedness, 2C-T-4 is a wonderful, lulling, energizing and consuming drug. I have no desire to augment or change the effect of 2C-T-4 in any way. I'm sure I'll have some weed and nitrous later, just to see how the interaction is... but right now, 2C-T-4 on its own is blowing by wave over wave for me to surf on. The body temperature thing is quite amusing... I'm still sweating profoundly, but not actually feeling hot at all.

Music. More music. On headphones now which is fine. Music. Aaaah. Thirst. Music. Music. Music!
/n
/n
12:27am: T-4 is a fantastic all-round body high. Anything feels great: being hungry as well as being full, moving as well as just sitting. Even a full bladder is fun on T-4. I'm sure sex is pretty cool too.
/n
/n
1:13am: Just had a couple nitrous capsules. 2C-T-4 seems to largely cancel out the effect of nitrous. I never had that before, I'm more than surprised. Nitrous did alter my perception of the outside world and had a dissociative/anaesthetic effect, but music perception was completely undisturbed. Weird. I generally don't really like nitrous anymore anyway. It interrupts the experience too much when combined with a non-dissociative drug. 
/n
/n
1:30am: Smoking some weed.
/n
/n
2:15am: Weed doesn't add much to 2C-T-4... if anything, it subtracts from it. Well... maybe I'm just disappointed that I'm feeling the trip fade. It does seem to fade at this point, there's a distinct drop in energy and intensity. It's weird as the typical duration of 2C-T-4 is thought to be 12 hours or more. Whatever, as I'm getting tired, it's time to call it a day. Music is still fun right now (Chemical Brothers on the turntable), but nowhere as orgasmic as earlier on.
/n
/n
Conclusion: My first experience with 2C-T-4 was nothing short of amazing. I'm very keen to see if this is repeatable. Perfect party material at any rate, especially with good music. Oh my God. I went from listening to music to becoming the music.

Next time I'll try 15mg. I'm very curious what a higher dose will do. Anything that tops the 10mg experience will have to be called unearthly good.</bodytext></report>
