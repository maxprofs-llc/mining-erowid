I made a decent trade at school during our first break with a shady character I know. I traded 3 of my 20mg Adderall (I had a whole bottle) for 4 5mg Vicodin, and a 'sleeping pill', which turned out to be Zyprexia. At first I thought it wasn't a good deal, but later today I would notice that it was indeed, great.

Time: 00:00 - Popped my first vicodin before 6th period, I wish I could have waited till later but I was very anticipated.
/n
/n
Time: 00:35 - Began feeling lighter, a little floaty, more socialable, calm, less anxious. Our class was on a mission to the textbook room to get the proper British Literature book. Most of the period was spent outside, and it gave me a chance to explore these new social skills the hydrocodone would teach me.

Time: 01:10 - School's pretty much out, I take my time leaving to talk to people, I feel much more comfortable with myself than usually, I tend to be an anxious person. I might suffer from anxiety, and the Adderall I have been taking the week before has made me more paranoid and anxious than before, even a while off the 'medication'. I definetly don't have ADD.

Time: 01:30 - I decide to leave, and try to get a ride home from my mom. She comes about 15 minutes later, so in the meantime I buy a Mango Madness Snapple and pop my second Vicodin with it. Oh man, the taste was unbelieveable. It might have been my altered state, but this was one of the best drinks I've ever laid my mouth upon, it was a beautiful mango ocean in my mouth. I didn't mind waiting another 10 minutes for my ride, as I saw an old friend and enjoyed my environment and my beverage as much as I enjoyed my body high at the time. I talked to my mom fine and felt comfortable around her, although the second Vicodin was creeping up on me, I embraced its white aura of nothingness and everything. 
/n
/n
Time: 2:00 - My mom leaves to get us some Subway sandwiches, oh boy! In the meantime, I swallow my third Vicodin with some Gatorade. I also do something I would regret later, I drink half a can of beer! I drank it pretty fast too, and to my stomach, it felt like there was a frog in there. I just felt gross, and the frog feeling was swelling up my stomach. I steal some tobacco from my dad's office, along with a skin, and enjoy this rare moment. I hardly ever smoke tobacco, but this was one of those times where I really wanted it. I could have enjoyed my decently-rolled cigarette more if I didn't have that nauseating feeling in my intestines from the beer. 
/n
/n
Time: 2:30 - I begin to feel even more euphoric. I take 2 mediocre hits of resin from my unpopular metal pipe, Cosmo. Thank God! The swelling frog in my stomach reverted to a minor tadpole. I also eat 4 crackers. They were good, to say the least. 
/n
/n
Time: 2:45 - I decide to 'cut the foreplay' and take my last vicodin. I had my doubts, since I still felt a little uneasy, but I was still comfortable. My white aura slowly grew stronger. 
/n
/n
Time: 3:15 - My stomach tadpole slowly grows larger and larger, I end up vomitting a lot of red gatorade and crackers. It was only half an hour after taking the vicodin, I was very angry thinking I had lost it. However, the cursed alcohol amphibian in my stomach was gone. The next 20 minutes I spent in vain and anguish, I told my friend on the phone I was the biggest idiot for drinking the beer and vomiting, which I thought killed most of my buzz. I literally felt like I was only on 2 vicodin, though it wasn't just after throwing up, it started since I was feeling nauseous. 
/n
/n
Time: 3:20 - Before I'm ready to lie down and really experience it, I do some things first. Read up on some message boards. I also do something really stupid. I wanted to test the pain-killing aspects of Vicodin so I whip out my crappy swiss army knife, and start slashing at my legs. It hurt just as much as it would if I'm sober. They didn't really bleed though, just turn red. I'm not a cutter, I was just doing something dumb. I also bite and pinch my skin, and it feels as if I'm not on vicodin, what the hell? I hope if I really need shit like this for pain it will do its job, I don't understand why I would still feel the pain. Maybe Oxy would work better? :-D

Time: 3:30 - I'm lying in bed, meditating, trying to experience the 'nod', a point which I've never reached before. It takes me a good 8 minutes to fully relax and just realize that I must be in a very relaxed position and mentality, if I want it too much it won't happen, I just have to 'let' it happen. And so it did. It's very hard to explain. My eyes were sort of half open and half closed, I believe, my pupils pinpoint in daylight and in night. Dreaming awake, that's what it is.

Once in a while I would come to, sit up, and admire the beauty of my room. A whole orchestra is playing my senses completely in tune, my blankets are the ocean, my COOL BREEZE fan from Target is the gentle, yet taunting sea breeze. Each breath is my first breath in the hospital room, and my head is being pulled out from my mother's womb. I bet my mother was feeling the same, as she was on IV Morphine during her C-section. I'm glad she got to experience a state similar to the one I was in at the time, probably even stronger. I itch a little, but it's okay, I am more powerful than them in my own acre of Heaven's land. When one gets high, he or she gets closer to Heaven. Well, God cradles me like a baby in his arms, and I just don't care if I look immature to the onlookers, as they just can't get this high. 
/n

I wake up an hour and a half later, as most of my high is wearing off, very satisfied. I eat half a subway sandwich and some chips. It's damn good! While typing this report I found a small piece of marijuana under my keyboard, and get a little buzz off it. Is this an omen? Should I have been writing experience reports more often with my other drug experiences? I think I will.

Anyways, I can now grasp the opiate high, I know it's personality and it's characteristics. I finally understand that my passion for drugs is in depressants, no longer stimulants. I don't plan to take amphetamines or methamphetamines anymore, I have a new lover, her name is Opiate.</bodytext></report>
