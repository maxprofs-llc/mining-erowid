I received cyclobenzaprine from my doctor because of back pain, a symptom I had been controlling up until that point with weed, but still bothered me at work (since I don't smoke before work).

The first time I took the cyclobenzaprine I took the prescribed dose and thinking that its wasnt doing anything I decided to smoke a spliff to deal with the back pain (and boredom). After about an hour I noticed I was more than high from the weed. I felt very much detached from my body.

Another interesting thing was the coming down.  Normally I just start to feel less stoned after 2 hours or so.  But with the cyclobenzaprine in my system I stayed drowsy and introspective until I went to bed.  That night I slept like a baby.</bodytext></report>
