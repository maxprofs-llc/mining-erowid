I have been in 4 car accidents in 3 years and been on a number of muscle relaxers and pain killers. By far, XODOL is the best. It is 10mg of hydrocodone, and 300 of acetominaphin in on pill, decreasing the chances of liver problems.

The first time I took it I thought I was flying, my pain completely vanished. I took one XODOL, and a flexeril and was completely out of it for about 3 hrs. The next thing I know I am waking up to techno and feel like I actually slept a full night.</bodytext></report>
