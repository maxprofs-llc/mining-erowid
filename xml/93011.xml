I have battled chronic depression since my adolescence.  Years of therapy and rigorous exercise helped little until I started taking the new-generation anti-depressants. For the last 15 years or so, I have had (temporary) good results with a series of these: Zoloft worked well for some years, then lost its efficacy.  Effexor likewise, and then Cymbalta.  A couple of years ago, rather than change to a new drug when the Cymbalta started to work less well, my doctor prescribed Provigil as an adjunct to it.  It has been great, on the whole.

Because my insurance will not cover the drug for off-label use (I don't have narcolepsy, just depression), the cost of the prescription drug is prohibitive, so I have been buying modafinil from overseas pharmacies, and have mostly had good luck with these sources (once, the product delivered seemed inert).

I take 120 mg Cymbalta and 200 mg modafinil daily.

I find myself not depressed, have normal levels of energy (like other people, instead of feeling barely able to get out of bed), have little in the way of side effects.  I am more prone to motion sickness or other nausea than when not taking the drugs, but the problem is mild.

The one concern I have is that I have found that cutting the dose (as I did once for several days when I didn't place the online order in time) seems to have a dramatic negative  effect.  A couple of days at 100 mg/day instead of 200mg/day had me sleeping 12 or 14 hours/night and dragging myself around feeling exhausted, and after 3 or 4 days at the lower dose, I experienced a  pretty serious bout of depression (uncontrollable weeping; ruminative, self-lacerating thoughts; generally excruciating misery).  A day or so back on the full dose put me right, but it has left me a bit nervous about the prospect of ever getting completely off the drugs.</bodytext></report>
