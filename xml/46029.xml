I was with a friend in Japan and had just bought 2-CE at a vendor.  It came in 100mg powder or 30mg/ml bottle of oil; and having no scale, I opted for the safer liquid vial.  My friend complained about a stomach-ache right after I just downed a little over half the bottle, so I dropped him off at his hotel and took the subway back to the streets of Tokyo.
/n

The moment it really kicked in full blast was while I was exiting the subway. It occurred to me then, that I was left in the middle of the streets. All alone. With nothing but 1,000 yen (U.S. equivalent to $10). After JUST taking the 2-CE. I. Am. FUCKED.
/n

As the trip grew with intensity, I came to an even harsher reality: THIS SHIT IS TOO INTENSE DAMMIT!  I was expecting some euphoria with mild hallucinations, but 20mg was too much, due to the fact that: 1) I am a 100 pound female, 2) Being a daily ex-meth user, I adjusted myself to a subtle high, so I am more sensitive to psychedelics, 3) I am in a foreign country, and though I can speak the language, Tokyo's activity and lights alone makes it overwhelming to be there SOBER.
/n
/n
I lost track of where I was walking, and stopped at an intersection to cross the street. But instead of waiting to use the pedestrian walkway, I jaywalked while the signal was still red. Keep in mind this is dangerous as HELL to do in a big city like Tokyo, where the drivers run amock like madmen of New York City, not to mention the fact that I was a bit delirious on psychedelics at the time.
/n
/n
A taxi cab turning left towards me screeched his brakes to a halt and honked, but I barely noticed. A guy across the street yelled out in a Jamaican accent to 'Hey, be careful!' Crossing the street, I made non-chalant eye contact with him, and moved past the crowd of shocked bystanders. I only had one mission in mind: Finding that vendor I purchased the 2-CE at.
/n
/n
I found the vendor after stumbling down the main street across from the bank. He was selling and making small talk with one of his regular customers, a Japanese man in his late 20's. 
/n
/n
I came up to the guy who sold me the RC.  'Oh man, this 2-CE is really not a good drug for me,' I sighed and wiped the sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand.
/n
/n
'You don't feel happy? Oh no,' His face filled with sympathy, 'I am so sorry that the 2-CE was not a good match for you, I feel responsible. Look, if you're having a bad trip, just try listening to some music and focus your thoughts into something pleasant.'
/n
/n
Coincidentally, I was lugging around a small backpack in preparation for departure to Kyoto the next morning. I was too exhausted to walk anywhere, so I politely asked for permission to sit next to his shop, which he allowed me to wholeheartedly. Using my bag as a backrest, I leaned against it and sat on the pavement, more worried about being in a comfortable position than appearing demure. I noticed passerby--both foreign and local--staring at me and giving me odd looks. I closed my eyes to avoid their awkward ogling.
/n
/n
I suddenly felt even more nauseated, to the point of it almost being unbearable. I lifted my head and felt beads of sweat trickle down the front of my shirt. I guess I looked really sick, because I could hear that same customer and the salesperson arguing about what they should do, but I couldn't form the words to respond.
/n
/n
'She looks really sick! Maybe we should get help.'
/n
/n
'I don't know... I think she's just having a bad trip, she will be fine hopefully.'
/n
/n
'How can you say that?!?!?! You yourself don't even take these chemicals! Look at how much she's sweating, that isn't normal!'
/n
/n
I wanted to tell them I was okay, but for some reason, it was incredibly difficult to form words. I bobbed my head back up in an effort to signal them that I was somewhat coherent. I kept reminding myself that this was nothing compared to the other shit; I have been through much, much worse. The last thing I wanted to do was attract attention, and that one action was enough. 
/n
/n
I heard from a distance, 'Look, I think she'll be okay. As long as we keep an eye on her and she stays awake it will turn out fine.'
/n
/n
I had a flashback about my last trip (which involved a suspected DOXX blotter), which was primarily regarding the theory of reincarnation, and about merely being generations of the same people, simply evolving for a better future. However, I distinctly remember that there was one final part of my trip that I did not finish, and it was concerning the placement of everything in the universe. Before, I was shown a map that tracked the location of where we were all destined to be...but the one part of that hallucination that was missing--the final piece to the puzzle--was my own destination. 
/n
/n
I focused all my energy and fell into a trance, reminiscing of the same patterns I had seen before. Eyes remained shut, the final piece to the map of fate, suddenly came rushing and unfolded before me in an earth shattering split second.
/n
/n
I opened my eyes, and the visuals were FUCKING. AMAZING. The city lights pieced through my retinas, shattering through my very center and touched with an awe I had never experienced before. Was this the reason I had tripped all those neon lights during my first DOXX trip, before I even knew it was about Tokyo?
/n
/n
The city was absolutely gorgeous. Just sitting there alone on the pavement, gazing up at the night sky, it was all so profound and rich with life. My God. It was paradise, and EVERYTHING just fit so perfectly together. And it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
/n
/n
I was purged of all destruction, and suddenly overwhelmed with a fierce determination to persevere. And much to the other natives' dismay, I stood up immediately and reassured that I was fine, explaining that I just took too much and was having flashbacks of bad trips. I apologized for causing them panic and trouble for not being more responsible.
/n
/n
A look of relief spread throughout both their faces, and the worker at the RC stand spoke first. 'I felt bad for you. Usually when people do these drugs they have somebody with them to help them out during a bad rip. I've never done these myself, and I didn't know what to do. I was getting so worried.'
/n
/n
I learned then that he himself did not take the substances he was selling. As a member of the older generations, he strongly believed in consuming only natural products and had no experience with any chemicals aside from methylone.
/n
/n
'Weren't you scared all by yourself? Any ordinary person would have called police or an ambulance at the first hint of trouble.'
/n
/n
I told him, 'It's okay, I've been through much worse, I've learned to be patient and handle those kind of situations. Besides, I'm always partying with people...Being with myself for once was a really refreshing change for me.'
/n
/n
'I know the feeling.'
/n
/n
The conversation eventually led to me asking how he gets away with police hassling him. He answered that all these drugs were actually legit and legal, just that his stand was so small and secluded it wasn't a big issue to local police. In fact, they even safely regulated it by doing a lab test on all the chemicals on a regular basis. I learned then that dealers and salespeople have as much responsibility to regulate safety by properly informing customers of the quality of product. So many times I have done my research, yet had close calls and almost died, because of misinformation or miscommunication from dealers.
/n
/n
I confided that I really feel for people in accidental OD situations, just because I could easily relate to them, having been through it all. I gave him tips on how he could minimize harm by including a detailed instruction in the most common international languages, and that selling in 3-dose liquid bottles (the kind he sold to me) was too inviting for an unknowledgeable buyer to make a purchase and down the entire 30mg, thereby creating a higher likelihood of incidence.
/n
/n
He proclaimed that I was very practical and had first-hand experience, therefore was very god at coming up with effective ways to reduce harm. He clarified that because of his inability to speak English, he could not properly express the VERY necessary and essential precautions one needs to take with careful dosage to many of his customers whom were English-speaking tourists. Because of this, he has gotten arrested in the past due to kids (and adults) who end up misusing the drug, or mixing it with alcohol, resulting in fatalities. 
/n
/n
I don't know what inspired me to be so free and open with this stranger (must have been the 2-CE), but I began talking to him about all sorts of experiences I have had with drugs, including my meth &amp; coke OD, about how I tripped for 5 days straight on an unknown psychedelic, how I had quit meth recently for the second time recently, and so forth.
/n
/n
He complimented my wisdom, experience, independence, and insight I had for someone of such young age, adding that I was so brave. 'Many times we are often judged as brainless, low-life scums without so much of a second thought. And sometimes I think it's true. But you are different...It's a nice change from the rest.'
/n
/n
I asked what he meant.
/n
/n
'Just more grown up. You realize what many adults still do not know. How old are you anyways? 22? 23?'
/n
/n
'Nineteen.'
/n
/n
'19?!?!?!!? SHIT!!!' He couldn't believe it. 'That's incredible! You are REALLY something! You are young but you take so much action, I wish I could be like you. You have much power and are so unique, I bet you get told that all the time!'
/n
/n
I shrugged. 'I guess, but I'm just average.'
/n
/n
'No way,' he insisted. 'You have no fear, I really admire that. I am amazed that you can do all these things.'
/n
/n
'I'm just bored,' I laughed, and he did too.
/n
/n
He got serious again. 'I really mean it, no joke. You will definitely make it big somewhere. I can feel it.'
/n
/n
We shared an instant bond. I spent all night exchanging stories and sharing experiences with a complete stranger all night in a still-technically foreign country. And you know what, I had the time of my LIFE. We watched the sun rise on my comedown, and it was absolutely breathtaking. It was a truly unforgettable experience. 
/n
/n
Since then, I have experimented with 2-CE on several occasions, and discoverd that it is not the drug for me, though I inevitably have an amazing time on it due to pure luck or coincidence like above.  I have also found that through this, I prefer mild visuals with a euphoric body high, so 5mg is the perfect dosage for me.  Always start low with this drug...20mg is no fucking joke, for real!</bodytext></report>
