If any one is ever thinking of getting a cheap high and trying this datura, Think Again!. After I first heard of this plant I was very excited about trying it. Well finally my time came. I was by the Delaware in PA and stumbled across A couple plnts. I took 4 pods and a bunch of leaves and brought them home.

I initially started off with eating 3 leaves and a tbl spoon of seeds. After an hour all I felt was a dry throat. So I ate two more spoonfuls and brewed 2 more leaves in some tea. After that I went to go lay down and wait for the effects. Next thing I know I woke up in a hospital with an IV in my arm almost naked in a gown. I was very delierous and stayed there for 2 days. When I got out my dad told me what really happened. He said he took me to the emergency  room  and I kept buggin out and talkin to people that werent there. He said I freaked out because I thought some lady got murdered. He tried taking me to the bathroom but I had no idea how to pee or where I was. We went back to the room and I peed all over myself and started talking all this crazy stuff. I then got transfered to another intensive care unit where I woke up very sick. I heard things, saw horrible images. I almost died that night.

Datura is not a psycodelic drug. It is a very potent poisonous plant. I was lucky. Please anyone thinking about trying this, rethink it could be the last thing you ever do.</bodytext></report>
