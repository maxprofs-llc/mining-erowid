I found a Datura inoxia plant out in the middle of the dessert while hiking one day. She was all alone some of the only greenery on the horizon. Knowing of its capabilities I took it home to do more research. After reading countless stories suggesting to never ingest Datura I decided to do it anyway. First I ate 1 seed waited then to and hours later I ate 6 seeds(fresh). Then made a tea of 7 green leaves. Boiled the leaves and drank the liquid and tossed the leaves. I had quite a body high for one hour and felt sleepy. After reading stories of people being hospitalized I thought I was next. Once I stopped worrying the high was gone, I awoke an hour later with no effects. I know I have a good strain of inoxia but I still trying to find a correct dosage to produce desirable effects.</bodytext></report>
