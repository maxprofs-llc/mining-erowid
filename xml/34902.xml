I went on a burn run and ate 2 Amitriptyline thinking I could determine my dose once they started kicking in. An hour and a half later I felt nothing so I popped 3 more and began to feel a body buzz. I figured I had better drive home and so in doing so I started to hallucinate. I thought a deer was in the road and slammed on the brakes for no reason.

When I got home the walls were crawling and I found myself lounging tiredly at the computer. When I heard my mom pull in I jumped into bed and told her id been up all night and that I was going to take a short nap.

My short nap lasted 17 hours.

17 hours of talking and walking in my sleep. Some of the strangest dreams Ive ever had. the one time I woke up, I was in a trance and could hardly make my way to the bathroom.</bodytext></report>
