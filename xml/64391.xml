After years of experience trying to find that miracle pill which never came, I finally found something that cut down my drug cravings completely.

Suboxone, what a wonderful drug if used in really small doses. For my cravings of drugs it has totally satisfied my apetite. In fact, whenever I think about lighting up or toking up, I say to myself, I have suboxone, not meant for what I'm taking it for, but it definately works, and the world should be let known that suboxone should not only be used for opiate withdrawal. It's an amazing drug if used properly.
