Where I come from, South Africa, this drug is not taken orally as it's done in the rest of the world our country has a much more interesting aproach, smoking it. Methaqualone or Mandrax as it is reffered to here is the most used drug in South Africa. I have smoked a lot of Mandrax, which i do not regret, but i am really thankful that I don't do that shit anymore seeing as it's one of the most addictive substances around and has fucked up many, many lives.

I smoke it outa a bottle neck with a mixture of weed and tobacco. I fill the pipe with the weed and tobacco mix and smoke a little of it. Then I put out the pipe and put a little or big scoop of the crushed up white pill into the pipe. I stir it in a little with a match. Then I hit that pipe as hard as I fucking can. The world will change. My whole body goes numb. I start to drool. My eyes may roll back or close. I finish half the pill in this way, usually with a couple of people, it'll get you all absolutely wasted.

I usually get about 8 hits of the pipe out of half a pill, that's 16 hits from a whole one. Don't try smoking this stuff alone because you will not be able to light the second pipe.
