I had read many reports about mimosa extraction and it seemed to me to be one of the more powerful trips out there. I've tripped mainly on shrooms but have lately been looking for some legal ways to aquire a new experience. I ordered 56 gr of mimosa bark from an online store and a good amount of syrian rue seeds as well. My first try wasn't as good as I had hoped. I made a tea from the brew that tasted so foul. It was totally bitter. I was expecting a bad taste according to the reports I had read but bleh! It is sooo bitter. Any way, I ended up puking my guts out 30 minutes after I started drinking the mess.(i.e. I don't recommend the tea.)

I decided to try a better extraction method. I read up on it and tried my own hand at a cross method from different sources. I had already shredded the bark in a blender (it worked nicely). I placed my remaining bark(40 gr) in a pot of water(4 cp) and lemon juice(1 tblsp). I boiled it for 30 minutes. I did this 3 times collecting the water each time. On the final extraction I soaked the bark in Level vodka for 15 minutes(I was out of lemon juice) and then dumped it in the water and boiled another 15 minutes. Added all the water together and boiled it down until it became syrupy, I guess that's a technical term. I then poured it on to a sheet pan I had covered with foil. This stuff can really stick in this phase. I stuck it in the oven at about 250 degrees.

I continued to check on it until it obtained a tar like consistency. Ohh, I also put about 5 gr of ground syrian rue in the boil I used vodka with. I have no idea if this helped anything.

The time was about 5:30. I scraped the foil and collected the goop into a disposable plastic container. I took 4 gr. of syrian rue about 40 minutes prior to consuming the dmt. I then took a spoonful of the dmt goo which totaled a little over 1/3 of the goop I had made. About 20 minutes later my stomach began to hurt and I thought surely I was going to puke again and nothing would happen. Then an hour after consumption the pain stopped. I opened my eyes and it looked like drops of water were hitting the apparently liquid ceiling which was now greenish instead of white. I had other decent visuals but no introspection as I had hoped. Then about an 1 and 1/2 hours later it abruptly stopped. Like somone had turned off the water. Dissapointment.

I decided to try 4 days later with the remaining goop. I had left it to sit in darkness and it had become thicker. At 9:00 p.m. I took 5 gr. syrian rue ground up. At 9:30 I took the goop covered in peanut butter. It is still damn bitter. I then drove 30 minutes to meet my friends who were going to keep an eye on me just in case. I began to feel very anxious but also calm on the drive. By the time I arrived at Blockbuster ( where my friend works/ usually gets slow after 10:00, safe place ) I knew I was going to trip hard. I had that super anticipation feeling. About 10 minutes later I began to get visuals and a body high identical to many of my shroom trips. It was good, but then thirty minutes later it all but vanished. I was sad but still felt a little trippy when I stood completely still. Then it happened. My stomach began to hurt. 'Oh my God', I thought to myself,'It hasn't even kicked in yet.' I sat down outside and stared at my blurred reflection in the window. My mind began to race. Visuals began to swarm all around the reflection of myself. I thought about my entire life. Who I was, how I came to this moment in time. I was blown away. When I closed my eyes, hands, flames, and rainbows spiraled from the bottom of my vision accompanied by this primitive drum beat in my head. I opened my eyes and another one of my friends, P, whom I had given HBWR seeds to so he could trip with me, came outside to sit with me.

I was beside myself with excitement and joy. It was great to be myself at this moment. I enjoyed P's company very much. Then another friend who was an older black man did something totally unexpected. He began to play 80's rock music starting with Bohemian Rhapsody. I opened my eyes to see that all sorts of little insects were crawling on me including a spider. Normally I would have jumped up and dusted myself off, but it didn't bother me. I blew the spider and he dangled from my hand on a thread. Now all this and the music began to get the better of me and I stood up and began to move with the music. I felt so great. One of the best body highs I have ever had. I was wired with an abundant amount of energy. Standing still wasn't really an option so I resorted to speed walking in a large circle so as to not leave the safety of my friends. I touched everything I walked past. When I stopped walking, I started doing something I have never done, at least never done unless trying to get a laugh. I began slowly dancing in a Michael Jackson kinda way. It felt weird but so natural. I don't dance.....ever.

Time was moving so slowly it seemed as if it wasn't moving at all. Finally I went inside; no one had come by the store for quite some time. I then witnessed my friends having one of those conversations that only happens when you are tripping. Not because you are tripping, just when. I was astonished at the things I was hearing. They were also closing down the store which they had seemed to be doing for days now. I was stuck in a time loop. I went back outside and sat on the hood of my car. It was my car. I could sit on it if I wanted to. It felt good to know that. I closed my eyes and saw brilliant spiraling celtic knots which I often see tripping. Then, Jerry Garcia pops up and gives me the peace sign and disappears. I know nothing of his music or him, but it didn't really seem like him. It actually felt like I had seen God. Like he was trying to prepare me for something intense. Then I started to feel bad. I had felt nothing but good for the last 2 hours or so. I had no idea how long it had truly been.

From here things went south. I stumbled to the edge of the sidewalk and began to puke my guts out hard core. I stumbled backwards back to the sidewalk and leaned up against the movie return box. I felt terrible, both mentally and physically. I dry heaved a few more times and puked a little more. I have never felt this bad in my whole life. I thought I was dying, and desperately wished for an ambulance. By this time, time was now frozen. The lights from the store went off. My friends were done closing. I was stuck in some kind of purgatory and was terrified at the prospect that this feeling of pain would last for what seemed like eternity. I couldn't move, talk, think of anything else other than the mistake I had just made. The price I paid for forbidden knowledge you are not supposed to have until the end of your life. I felt like crying but couldn't. I was too scared. Finally I broke the chains of muscular paralysis. Got up and sat down next to an ash tray and trash can because they looked like I felt. I just wished I could die and finally understood the name of Garcia's band , The Grateful Dead; something that had aluded me for years.(It was before my time. I'm only 20.) I just wanted to be normal, the way the rest of my life had been. I remember P had told me he was going to the playground at this school across the street sometime ago. I had to find someone to get me grounded.

I started walking begging God to take this from me. I told him that I got it 100%, just send me back. I couldn't seem to find the playground that I had been to tons of times since I was a child. I was flipping out. The sun was never going to rise. I finally found the playground and P wasn't there. This was more than I could bear. I found myself making sounds of defiance that my 2 year old nephew makes wishing all this would just stop. I thought of my family and how I could never see them. I wished my mother was there to hold me. I decided to call one of my friends who I normally and foremost trip with. The phone rang once and then I got a computer recorded message. Not his voicemail, not him. Instead I heard,'You cannot reach this customer right now. Please hang up your phone.' What the hell! I knew now I was truly alone and not on the Earth that I had once known.

Everyone was gone. I gave up and laid down on a slide and died a little more as I stared at the stars twinkling like a thousand diamonds. After a little while I begged to be allowed to talk to my friend Keith. He had called me right as I started tripping so I thought that God would let me talk to him. I found his name, hit send, and held my breath. It rang, once, twice, he answered. Thank you God, thank you for Keith. He played a guitar riff for me that he had made up and played  for me 100 times over the years. It really helped bring me back and he didn't even know I needed his help. He just did it. Then I heard all kinds of laughter in the background and it seemed like everyone I had ever known was there and in on this whole huge joke that had just happened to my soul. I demanded to know who was there. He replied,'you know everyone.' He was just a little drunk and had know idea what that did to me. Then he named people and they talked to me, asked me where I was and where I had been. Helped ground me better. Made me laugh a little.

My other friends found me at the playground and we walked and talked on the way to a friends house down the street. I was beginning to feel alot better about everything that had just transpired. Walking with my 2 buddies made me feel the age of my soul. I felt as if we had done this same thing many times for thousands of years. It is how God keeps us sane about the concept of eternity. We never seem to get all the way to heaven. I told God that I would walk in his ways forever and thanked him for what he had given me and for allowing me the experience. Ohh, something strange, my friends told me I puked up alot of stringy stuff and little black balls.. I had not eaten anything stringy for days if not longer and only rice and pork like 5 hours prior to tripping. The little black balls were the undigested DMT lumps I had taken earlier. Over all it was quite a night. The most intense parts lasted just a little over 3 hours but it felt like it had taken days. The sun did rise, and the day was more beautiful then it had been for quite some time.

If you are going to try this, BE DAMN CAREFULL! This is a powerful tool for getting to know yourself and your exsistence which exists so delicately. Trip to the edge of the universe, just remember to come home.</bodytext></report>
