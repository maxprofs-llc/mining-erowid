This is what I've written down of an experience that a friend of mine had and told me about:
/n
/n
Background: Male, mid twenties. Extensive experience with a wide variety of mind altering substances. Earlier the same day 1 mg of his prescribed clonazepam and his daily kratom dose was ingested, reportedly not to get high but to keep him from getting sick. This may have dulled his experience. 
/n
/n
Mindset: In a normal neutral mood. Hanging out at home, listening to music and chatting with friends on the internet.
/n
/n
T+0:00 250 mg dimethocaine insufflated. Gentle with no burn at all. 
/n
/n
T+0:10 Numbing of the face and a slight euphoria beginning to build up. Light soft speediness, unlike the comparatively harsh speediness of amphetamines. Feeling light and talkative and a bit lightheaded actually. Only slight increase in heart rate (maybe + 20 bpm or so) but peripheral vasoconstriction is pronounced rendering hands, feet and foreskin ice cold. No increase in sex drive, but notable shrinkage of external male reproductive organs is present.
/n
/n
T+1:00 Effects beginning to fade. The light euphoria experienced earlier is no longer present but he still feels energetic and in a good mood. 
/n
/n
T+1:30 Decides to snort another 100 mg and rectally administer  150 mg. 
/n
/n
T+1:45 Feeling a very subtle euphoria coming back from the last refill. Chatting away on the internet with me and reportedly feeling good. Nothing like the real South American thing thou. More of a background feelgood. Got up from the computer to get his phone and felt his heart rate increase fast. Nothing bad and he's back to the previous slight increased rate within a minute.
/n
/n
T+2:15 Basically back to baseline. 
/n
/n
T+2:45 At this point he reports still feeling some residual light stimulation, vasoconstriction and increased heart rate. Mood seem to have gone gently back to normal without any crash.
/n
/n
Summary: Nice experience but really subtle. Therefor not really worth it considering the high price at the moment (around 20 per gram from RC vendors in Europe), unless you have a lot of money to spend on novelty drugs that is.</bodytext></report>
