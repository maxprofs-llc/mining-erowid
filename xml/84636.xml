Hello fellow travelers of mind. We have that drive in us for direct experience; experience has been demolished from our society. Many of us have been ostracized, criticized, or otherwise put down in life for pursuing that intangible right. Then, there are those of us who are exiled because of our sicknesses. I have been in both; this report is about this sickness, and how one of us has finally found balance.

Today I was discharged from a mental health facility after a one-week stay; and Ive not felt this balanced and optimistic about my Bi-Polar ll Disorder since my diagnosis. After being stabilized the concluding medications ended up being: Lithium Carbonate ER (900mg daily), Bupropion (300mg daily),  Lisdexamfetamine (30mg daily), Clonazepam (2mg daily) and Ambien Cr (12.mg daily).

It is great that to be balanced. All of you who are suffering or not found the right combination keep your head up and you will find your combination, you will find your practice, your will find what it is youre seeking. We all are looking for that one thing that is missing we will find it.</bodytext></report>
