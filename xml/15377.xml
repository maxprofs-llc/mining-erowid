I'm submitting this report because my experience was so intense and different from anything else I've tried, and also as evidence that packaged 'Legal Highs' can actually work . . . albeit with a kick start from some good old illegal drugs as well.

On Sunday afternoon my girlfriend and I decided to take some Herbal Highs I'd bought a few weeks ago. I'd bought them (along with some Salvia, which I still haven't broken through on yet) thinking that they would be a nice, fairly mild introduction to psychedelics for us (I really want to try acid and other psychedelics when I can get some, my GF is less sure but is interested and wanted to start off with something mild). Well I thought they would be mild, in the end I had a pretty intense experience, but anyway, you'll see why.

These Herbal Highs came as 6 x 800 mg green gelcaps filled with a combination (I don't know the proportions) of Morning Glory seeds, Calamus extract and Kava Kava extract. I'd read up on Morning Glory etc., tried to find out all I could. So (as recommended on the packet) we took 2 caps each, then 2 more every 30 minutes with lots of water - this is apparently to avoid nausea . . . HA bloody HA!! My GF vomited shortly after her 3rd + 4th caps, I managed to hold back the queasiness (which came on really quickly, felt like a blender churning your stomach) until just after my 5th + 6th at which point I puked more violently than ever before in my life - proper projectile vomiting. I then took my GFs remaining 2 caps as she didn't want them after puking.

So for the next 2 hours we sat around, feeling little more than an edge of nausea apart from a kinda stoned (but not in a nice way) feeling - just sluggish and tired. Anyway, after this time I went upstairs to get something, and going into my dark room I noticed the green power light on my computer was kinda brighter, I couldn't keep it in focus either, it swum around and distorted into a kind of linear shape, that to my mind looked like a hedgehog. I'd been thinking that nothing was going to happen because we'd puked too early, but with this mini visual I got faith again. My GF came upstairs and we then smoked a couple of pipes of skunk to bring out the effects. Well this is where it REALLY got interesting.

The only way I could describe what I felt was that every feeling and emotion was amplified and made much more real - heat felt not hotter but more heat-like, likewise with cold, the same with textures. The emotional amplification really started when I put Push - The Legacy on the stereo (one of our all time favourite trance tunes) The feeling we got was like the feeling I get when I hear a tune I last heard when I was on ecstasy in a club and get that tingly sensation, but amplified many, many times. The feeling of euphoria that the trance gave us was so intense that we both decided to drop pills, more from the memory of the tune in the clubs than from anything else. So I took 2/3 of an ecstasy pill (a white number 1, good strong pills) and my GF took the remaining 1/3.

We then had a momentary 'WTF are we doing taking all this shit on a Sunday night' moment, but that passed. By this point I was really starting to trip quite heavily, no visuals but a really intense emotional change. My GF says now that over the remaining course of the night she wasn't tripping anything like as hard as I was, but it was like she could see and understand where I was when I spoke about it, without actually being there - like seeing someone a few 100 metres down a road, i.e. where they are but not exactly what they can see.

Anyway, I was now feeling the most incredible sense of widening of time. There was no perceptible come-up, it felt like nothing had changed at all, but everything just became so loaded with meaning and significance. For about 30 minutes this feeling continued, we went out for a short walk as dusk drew in and I had the most incredible feeling that I'd lived my entire life to be here, at this moment, with my girlfriend. It was like time was an hourglass and I was at the point right in the middle where the sand falls through, I could see all the events, people, feelings in my life which had led me up to this point, and see them all in the same light. Everything pointed me to this place and moment, and most importantly this person - the amplification of feeling I talked about earlier was working on the love I feel for my girlfriend, and I realised that she was the most important defining single thing in my life, the person who was most important to me and who would shape my life to come, the person who I wanted to be with forever. This amplification of love was so intense I was almost overwhelmed, I found it very hard to move or do anything, the emotions just overrode everything else.

Anyway, this peak which at the time seemed timeless passed, after this I became rather confused and anxious, I think it had all been a bit too much for me - I kept saying that I was getting lost, it felt like there was too much of this widened reality and I couldn't find my way back to the section of it where I should be. It didn't help that we put the film Shrek on when we got home, and because I know the film very well and knew exactly what lines were coming next my sense of time got really messed up. Later we tried to play chess, but that really messed with my head as well  eventually we fell asleep, I felt tired and washed out, drained with trying to sort out everything that had happened, but at the same time still marvelling about the experience.

Well, that ended up going on for a whole lot longer than I expected, but I wanted to share that experience with people, it was by far the most intense and important drug experience I've ever had. The most amazing thing was the confirmation of what I already knew, that I am madly in love and want to be with my girlfriend forever.

I would definitely recommend morning glory seeds to others if you would like a different experience, they gave me a very thoughtful and pleasant high, until I became overwhelmed that is. I would like to try them on their own in the future (i.e. not mixed with the other things in the Herbal Highs), but I would definitely recommend a strong anti-emetic for the nausea.
