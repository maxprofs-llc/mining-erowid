Smoked five large bong hits to get me going for the evening, it is exactly 9:00p.m. my time, and I plan on dosing a little before 10:00p.m.  I'm feeling pretty high off of the marijuana.  I plan on taking a shower to refresh myself for the night ahead.

Just got out of the shower and I'm feeling very refreshed.  I've still got a nice weed buzz going and my eyes are a little red still.  I'm getting ready to dose here in about fifteen minutes.

INGESTED: 2.5mg Klonopin 
/n
Just dosed 2.5mg Klonopin.  I took two 1mg pills, one solid and one broken in half.  I also took an additional half of a 1mg pill.  Not that bad of a pill taste really, kind of a light bitterness in the back of the throat when drinking iced tea.  I've tasted much worse pills.  Getting my usual pre-buzz jitters, especially since it's the first time I've tried this drug.  I have, however, tried a few opiates (Methadose 20mg tablets) and benzos (Valium, Xanax).  I'd like to take the time to tell you a little about myself.  I am nineteen years old and weight approximately 250Lbs, at 5'11'.  I have been smoking marijuana daily for the past seven years of my life.  I experimented with acid when I was fifteen, went on an E binge between 16-17 and then went back to bud.  I occasionally pop Valium, Xanax and Vicodin whenever it is available to me.  When I found out that I could get Klonopin, I jumped at the chance to try a new drug.  I'm going to finish watching this movie which should end in about thirty minutes or so.

Just smoked a cigarette and I'm debating as to whether or not I want to hit my bong.  I might as well, since I doubt the affects around going to hit me for a little while.  I ate somewhat of a big dinner about two hours ago and I still feel a little bit of it churning down there.  Yeah, I'm smoking my bowl.

Just took three nice bong-hits with some of my highs.  I figured I'd waste some of the goodness because I plan on getting messed up tonight.  I'm about to kick back, check out a few websites and check back here in a few minutes.

Starting to get a few effects.  Most likely from my excellent weed buzz, but the Klonopins might be kicking in.  My head feels a little spaced out, the keys feel a little more difficult to hit and I find myself stopping in mid-thought and then resume as if nothing happened.

It is definately kicking in right now, either that or I'm getting a really good placebo effect.  My vision seems a little spacy and it's getting harder to focus on objects, I'm also getting a little bit more tired.  That might just because it's the end of the day and I'm getting naturally tired, I'm not too sure.

Just stood up and walked around for a minute or so, time seems to be moving very slowly.  It is difficult walking around the room, I kept wanting to lean on things and at times my legs felt weak.  I'm about to play a video game for a minute or so since I have nothing better to do at the moment.

Very strong high, very similar to drinking on marijuana.  The keys are getting very difficult to hit properly.  I kind of like this drug since I haven't smoked a cigarette in over an hour.  That is very unusual to me.  That last hour seems to have flew by.  I just turned on some Led Zeppelin and I'm enjoying some nice calming affects.  At the moment, I have no worries in life (Not that I had any to begin with).  Cigarettes taste a little different right now, usually my full-flaver tastes sweet, but it left a nasty aftertaste when I smoked them this time.  I almost feel like I don't want to smoke this, but I know I'll get irritable and pissed off if I don't.  I'm about to go wander around my house for a few minutes.

The effects are definately great.  I had quite a bit of difficulty walking around and I kept finding myself having to prop myself on objects.  My typing is severely decreased, but I don't find myself making too many mistakes.  I plan on looking at my eyes in the mirror here in a little bit.  I'm definately feeling the drowsy affects of this drug.  It almost feels like I just want to turn off all the lights, lay down on my bed and just zone.

I've baselined at the peak it seems, my motor skills aren't as bad as they were about forty-five minutes ago, but they're still not great. I plan on drinking a can of Budweiser and smoke a bowl here in a few minutes to bring the buzz back up.  Overall, I am liking this buzz very much, it is a typical Benzo 'downer' buzz, but you feel more high than anything.  It's a great buzz, I highly recommend it.

INGESTED: (1) 12Fl. Oz. Budweiser 5.0% Alc/Vol.

I can feel the buzz start to deplete and I am becoming extremely tired.  The buzz so far has been awesome, I have noticed great increases in my creativity.  I'm also starting to develop a little indigestion/ heartburn, but it's nothing that I haven't dealt with before.  The beer is going down very well, I usually don't drink anything under 7.0%, so it kind of tastes like sweet, carbonated water.  I am thoughouly enjoying it, I'd like to experiment with lower doses of Kolonopin and higher doses of alchohol.  Once I finish this beer I'm going to go take a piss, and pack myself another good-night bowl since I feel that this evening is coming to an end.  I just stood up to grab my cigarettes from my counter and got a whicked head-rush, that definately stepped up my buzz.  I'm still staggering around more than usual.

I finished off the beer and it definately kicked the buzz up just a notch.  I didn't help my indigestion, though.  I plan on taking a few bong rips here in a minute to end my night.  Marijuana seems to make a great ad\dittion to this experience.

I found that a 2.5mg dose, was more than enough to provoke a very good buzz.  It is now T+5:00 since I dosed and I still have a very strong buzz.  I plan on enjoying myself the rest of the night, listening to Led Zeppelin.</bodytext></report>
