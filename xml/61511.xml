I 2 pills twice daily for 9 days, usually with breakfast. On day 10 I was late for work so I took them with my Zoloft (Same Dr gave me the script) and a cup of coffee.

I went to raves for a period of about 2 years, 5 years ago, during which I did mostly ecstasy and amphetamines -but I've tried almost everything I could get my hands on at the time. Never had a reaction like this before, no family history of seizures either.</bodytext></report>
