I have taken promethazine before, yet in combonation with meperidine in my favorite capsule called Mepergan Forte.

Yet my friend recentley was prescribed a bottle of 25 mg promethazine tabs only. Of course he called me up to make a few bucks.

That night at around 6 PM I took 3 of the tablets.  Before swallowing I snapped them in half on the scored line.  They were quite hard to break actually.  Dont no if that made a difference or not but I broke them anyways.  I swallowed the 3 tabs, 75 mg in all and waited for effects.  I new that on Mepergan I felt a heavy alcohol buzz and a warm heavvvvy sensation.  So I sat and wondered which of the effects would stand out tonight.

I played cards with some friends and after about 45 minutes the tabs had almost completely set in.  I felt a decent alcohol buzz along with an anxious feeling I cannot describe.  Its not an ampheta type of anxiousness yet a axniousness with which I didnt even think about pursuing nor was I intrested.  /n After 2 hours of feeling this my friends decided we should goto another friends house so I drove over and on the way I saw several hallucinations.

It was dark out and I was driving down a road, feeling the effects of basic alcohol comsumption, Lagged time, blurry vision.  I approached my friends apartment complex and noticed a man standing infront of a doorway. I turned my head and looked back and no one was to be found.  I then pulled up to my friends building and noticed a girl sitting on the stairs.  I turned off my car and looked up to see nobody.  This insanely freaked me out because I didnt know if I was hallucinating or not since my lagged time vision and blurryness, yet these people were so real looking.

After I arrived at my friends house I felt the anxious feeling plaguing me extremely heavyly.  This is the most uncomfortable and annoyed ive ever felt in my life.  I just wanted this drug to be over extremely bad. I cannot stress how bad I was annoyed and fed up with promethazine.  I felt like id rather die than endure this feeling of coming down for another second.

At about 1 I drove home with the effects lessing but tiredness increasing.
/n

I awoke in the morning at 10 A.m. extremely sedated still and extreme tiredness plaguing me.  I felt almost numb.  I went to turn on the shower and I felt myself push the handle up yet, milli seconds after I had done this task it was as if I relieved the physical feeling of turning on the shower.  This repeated feeling is the weirdest feeling ive ever felt from any drug.  It was as if I actually did it again, yet my hand didnt move, but in my mind I felt the physical touch.  This happend several times when touching the soap and shampoo.  Absolute weirdest feeling, its like the opposite of trying to move a limb that has been severed. yet ive never had any limbs severed, that is all I can relate it to.

I dont plan on ever taking this drug again due to its extremely annoying and eerie side effects.</bodytext></report>
