Well the night started up as I counted me out 600mg of diphenhydramine. Well, the night before I tripped hard off these pills and it was quite pleasing. But the night after I had a lot more so I decided to popped 24 more but the thing I did not know I had the medicine built up in my system which I would then overdose, bad. And to make it work I broke each pill on half and took it on an empty stomach. Then it hit me. My heart slowed down drastically and every minute I would have shooting pain that felt like electricity either going up my chest in my neck down my back or down my leg and my arms.

I noticed my pulse was low and I couldnt even feel it so this is when I stumbled to the bath room and induced vomiting for I could at least get all the shit out that hadnt been absorbed. After that, I drank 2 glasses of milk which would absorb most of the shit in my stomach. I wouldnt go to sleep even though how fucking tired I knew that when people sleep the pulse slows down and if mine did that I knew I would die. I thought I would of died. I thought it was the end. I felt stupid as fuck afterwards also.</bodytext></report>
