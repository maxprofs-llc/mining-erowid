OK one thing I wish I knew.. NEVER MIX CALAMUS AND ANY MILK PRODUCT..

 I was at a site and I guess this guy was sick or something.. he had a recipe for calamus drink... I had some with me and hadn't tried it yet so I decided to give it a shot.. The mixture was 1 cup of calamus root, 2 cups of water, 1 cup of milk, optional(choc syrup + ice cream for taste).. I mixed it all up and drank it.. Even with the syrup it was some nasty tasting stuff!.. Anyway I waited a few hours and felt nothing and it was getting late so I went ot bed.. About 2 hours after I fell asleep I awoke with a bad stomach ache and a terrible taste in my mouth.. i ran for the bathroom and puked the worst tasting shit I had ever tasted( this was 10 times worse than alcohol incidents) Anyway I felt kinda of out of it and decided to try to go back to sleep.. 10 mineuts later i got the feeling again and ran to the toilet and empty the rest of my stomach... for the rest of the night I sat by the toilet dry heaving.. it was the worst experience in the bathroom I ever had...
