The night before I had eaten 5Meo-DiPT (Foxy) and had a decent peak off of it.  I slept normally, woke the next day and anticipated trying 2C-I before going to a 311 show.  I dosed myself and several others with 22mg pills.  I ate around 7:00.

7:00 pm Watched some TV and then skate boarded with drunk roommate to the dorms.

8:00 pm Hoobastank opens for 311, not feeling much... lots of stimulation around me.  Lots of people I know, new friends and older ones too.

9:00 pm- 11:00 pm Danced at the 311 show but no incredible psychedelic feelings.

11:00 pm- back in the apartment, decide that I am not feeling the 2C-I and pop another full dose.  This was not a good idea because it doesn't take too much to fuck you up.  In retrospect I should have taken half a dose if anything else at all.

12:00 am After smoking some ganja we go to a neighbors apartment for a party.  Crazy numbers of heads and more people I haven't seen in a while.  Realizations of things have changed.  Everyone changes; I see it in myself and in old 'friends'.
/n

1:00 am Have to leave the party, no one left to chill with, not up to striking up conversation although I should have been able to do it.  Once outside I see a girl from class and talk with her for a while... invite her for a bong hit, no go, but its all good.

2:00 am Out to another apartment, less people and a much more relaxed environment.  I feel more social.  Colors are extremely vibrant, speech patterns are clear and exact.  Honesty is easy.  For a while I did good to not take things too far.

3:00 am I start to bug.  I'm left with three girls I know.  Two I like, one I'm attracted to, and one who tends to get on my nerves.  We're all close through experience however.  More people return, I begin to develop crazy theories about apartment hierarchy.  Just who is the top dog in the apartment?  I begin to worry that I can not trust anyone.

4:00 am I don't let anyone know that I feel bad.  I do begin to lose touch with reality however when I begin running in and out of different apartments on campus breaking light bulbs.  I tear one fluorescent light bulb out of its stand but my friend E took it from me.  I then unscrewed one bulb, which was also taken from me.  I go up to my other neighbors apartment and I'm acting fine when I decide to unscrew their turned on light bulb, try to squeeze it in my hand.  I decide to throw it against the wall just missing my friend M's head by two feet.  She had to pull glass out of her hair.  I then go next door and do the something in my CA's apartment.  A bunch of other shit happens and someone throws fist and busts my CA's lip.  I go back to my apartment but before I go in I take a swing at the light above my apartment door.  I see a cop parked outside another court and begin asking him where I live.  I was so confused that I didn't know if I was gonna end up in my hometown or if I was gonna stay at college.  I kept repeating my self saying, 'Yea, but was it good man?'  I kept thinking I'd wake up on the set of a TV show as John Goodman.  There was something about the phrases, 'Yea, but was it good man?  Yea man, it was John Goodman.'  I was completely out of my head for a good two hours.

5:00 My CA has been informed that I'm all fucked up on drugs.  Other kids come to my aid and begging to talk me down.  It was and interesting experience, words like Karma, and other religious references seemed to be what I responded to.  I also strive very hard to get laid.  I was going after friends and friends' girlfriends.  I was looking for some love, someone to take care of me.  I asked my male roommate to marry me. I think I freaked him out but he'll be ok.  He hugged me when I came back to reality and held my hand, and told me everything would be ok.

6:00 I'm down and begin to tell about my experience, believing that I was the baby Jesus, but I was about to be sacrificed.  I would only do things that would benefit mankind.  For some reason I thought that I needed to electrocute myself.  I was gonna take lightbulbs or the whole damn TV down to the lake and toss it in.  Then it occurred to me that if I stuck my finger in water and broke a light bulb, that'd probably do the trick.  I was thwarted in my unconscious but willing attempt to remove myself permanently from reality.

7:00 I'm finally going to try to go to sleep.  I sleep rather easily until about 5 or 6 in the evening.

The rest of the day I get to hear all of the wonderful things I did.  Breaking light bulbs near other peoples heads, getting in the middle of a fight, remembering about the other two lightbulbs.  All lightbulbs were on and in lamps that I am talking about.  I regarded the bong as a mode of transportation.  I thought life was a game.  I thought I had been baptized.  I thought StarTrek was all one big joke.  I felt layers of reality strip away.  The night felt more and more like a waking dream.  I'm happy to be unhurt, but I am somewhat angry with myself for the things I have done.  It was a learning experience, one in which I want to shift the learned to the applied.  I hope to finish college on time and get everything completed on time.  I know it's not gonna be easy, but I also think that I have pushed some of the boundaries far enough.  I need a break from not too sporadic ventures into subconscious realms.  I'm not done, but I need some sober time, after all, life is a trip with out drugs.</bodytext></report>
