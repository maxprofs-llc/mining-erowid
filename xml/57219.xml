Let me start by saying that the use of mushrooms for me involves a very severe and revealing spiritual aspect which is the primary motive behind taking them. In my past trips (a total of 5) I have been taught much by the mushrooms and my own personal guardian spirits about myself, the universe and my (mans) place in it.

Last weekend was my first trip in about four months, a brilliant and inspiring return to self and the world of knowledge that the mushrooms have to offer. The timing was impeccable as I had recently been testing my limits and endurance with regular cocaine use, which despite being self inflicted and therefore controlled, had brought me through a great struggle to a dark, doubtful part of myself from which the mushrooms swiftly delivered me. I had taken about 2.1 grams (one giant stem and cap) and had experienced the most vivid visual, aural and physical trip of my life.

Not having set aside a specific time to trip the following weekend my roommate and I spent almost the entire weekend waiting for the right moment to occur. After a lot of rest and preparation we finally set to it on Sunday evening, joined by C, one of my roommates close friends.

I measured out about 2 grams for each of us and a slightly smaller one for my third roommate A. We ate the mushrooms at around 6pm. I tend to purposely cut myself off from the outside world during trips so things like time become a little harder to pinpoint. As usual I felt things begin to change after about an hour. The sense of physical wellbeing began to grow slowly inside of me. But after what seemed like more then enough time I still hadnt broken through. Visual and auditory hallucinations were sparse and faint when they did occur. I had approached the threshold but hadnt crossed over.

I became very somber, feeling rejected by the mushrooms which only a week earlier had comforted me in their return by assuring me that they would always be with me and that I was meant to have them. I sought out my friends in the other room and told them what was happening. My roommate commented that he was doing fine but his friend C was having an experience similar to my own. He suggested eating another cap. We each took another average size cap. I then ate another small cap and stem bringing my total weight to approximately 3 grams.

For a while I wondered if this was even going to help. I reconfigured the lighting setup in my room to a combination of black and red light and put on some music. I felt as if I were searching for a key. It wasnt very long before I realized I had found it. The effect of the additional caps hit me and hit me fast. I almost exploded into the trip. Objects began to shift shape and color in the reddish dark. The city outside came to life glowing in the cold wind that moved grinning, swirling clouds across the sky. There was a shift in my thoughts as they became tinged with the truth of the mushrooms. I realized then what I had done, how greedily I had pursued this effect. But this I realized was my lesson for this trip. I stared at myself in the mirror for a long time watching myself transform before my eyes into several frightening non human forms. I basked in an ecstasy so intense I thought it would tear me apart.

By the time my roommate and C came to check on me I was somewhere else entirely. I opened the door shirtless, wild eyed and bathed in red light. Both my roommate and C jumped back in terror. They couldnt have picked a better moment though as I am sure that I wouldnt have returned from wherever my mind was going if the hadnt brought me back right then. They came into the room and things calmed down a little but I was at the top of the most extreme trip I had ever had. It was then that I thought about trying to smoke the mushrooms as a means of heightening the visual element of the trip. There was unanimous consent to this idea so I crumpled up a cap and packed it into a mid size wooden bowl.

I took the first hit, my mouth was instantly filled with dust. The smoke wasnt harsh at all though. I held it in for about twenty seconds before letting it out and passing the bowl to my roommate. Somewhere in the next few seconds a sort of frenzy began in my brain. Things moved very quickly, before I realized what I was doing I had retrieved a bag of Salvia Dinivorum (5x) from a stash spot on my desk. Acting completely on impulse I exclaimed that we had to put the Salvia in with the mushroom cap. I packed the bowl with a heft pinch of salvia and handed it back to C (who had never tried Salvia before). He took two hits and returned it to me. I took three quick hits and handed it to my roommate. At this point my third roommate A burst in compelled by God knows what to change the music. In the instant that the door open and the light from the hallway hit me so did the effects of the Salvia.

I couldnt speak and spat out a jumble of words, only some of which I was able to identify as English. The Salvia gripped me so ferociously that I could barely move. I began to sweat profusely. The bright light from the hallway engulfed me for a minute and then they came. I couldnt tell if there were one, five or a hundred but it seemed like they were everywhere, spiny reddish brown creatures moving at the speed of light all around the room and my body. They had long spindly noses and hands like polished branches. I spat out the only words my mind could formulate at the time. Tree People. In fact it was as I said Tree People that I began to catch sight of them. They took hold of me by the back of my neck and threw my body down onto my bed, stuffing my face into a pillow and holding it there. And then just as quickly they were gone. The next few minutes blew my mind as I witnessed a severe increase in visual hallucinations brought on from smoking the mushrooms and compounded by the Salvia trip I was now having.
/n

I asked C if he seen the Tree People since he had also shouted Tree People! at some point shortly after I had first said it. He said that he had felt them first and then as soon as I had said Tree People they took shape all around him. His description matched my own. My roommate who had also smoked the mixture said that he had not seen them. The rest of the night I was not myself. The increased visuals from the smoking mixture wore off after a short time but I still enjoyed an immense trip for the rest of the evening despite a sense of bewilderment that didnt subside until shortly before I fell asleep sometime around 2am.

I was left with such a vivid impression of these visitors I had called Tree People that I still swear that they were really there in the room with me. Ive seen spirits when smoking Salvia before but never like this. I would describe them as playful (without knowing their own strength) and still swear I heard them laughing and rustling when they moved. As real as the experience was I cant be entirely sure what happened and have only my very subjective description. Whatever it was we encountered/unlocked in that mixture but I am anxious to experiment with it again during my next trip. That moment, while not the peak of my trip, pretty much made the evening. And the state C and I were left in after their visit was ideal for the completion of our journey.</bodytext></report>
