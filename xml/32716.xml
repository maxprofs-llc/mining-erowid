I am male, 85kg and have no opiate dependence whatsoever.
/n
/n
7.15PM - Took 150mg of generic brand tramadol orally. 
/n
/n
7.25PM - Ate a sandwich before feeling any effects. 
/n
/n
7.30PM - 1st mild effects felt (Have to concentrate hard to notice.  Thought it could have been placebo, but, in hindsight, it was certainly the start of the 'come-up').
/n
/n
8.30PM - Now experiencing a very mild (but quite pleasant) opiate style stone. Some nausea (very mild again... just a feeling of slight queasiness). Appears to take some time to take affect fully.
/n
/n
9.00PM - Effect has deepened a little (pupils very slightly contracted and that 'squeezy' feeling behind the eyes that accompanies it). Queasy sensation persists. 
/n
/n
10.30PM - Effects are still intensifying. Not 'noddy' at all, but pleasantly mellowed with a slight 'stimulant' style effect in the background... Definitely worth trying in its own right (very curious to see how it reacts with Kratom.) 
/n
/n
11.30PM - Seems to have reached a plateau. Definite 'speedy' sort of feeling along with a mild euphoria. Slightly itchy around the face, queasiness has totally gone, now. 
/n
/n
3.15AM - It's difficult to sleep on this... Effects are starting to wear off (down to about 60% of the peak) 
/n
/n
8.00AM - Still feeling some effect - about 40% of the peak... (hard to put a figure on it). Could not sleep for the life of me.</bodytext></report>
