Most people find zopiclone has no recreational use. I beg to differ.

I have done this far too many times to report on just one event. I start with 7.5-10 mg of zopiclone and then have a few drinks, at least 1/2 pint of 80 proof, and top of the zopiclone later to a total of 15 mg usually. Then drink on! Once I hit 15 mg of zopiclone, it's lights out soon after. I just find that zopiclone combined with alcohol gives very pleasant results. Complete alcohol inebriation is achieved much easier and with a little more sedation/no rowdiness and no nausea. Go a little too far and I will black out.</bodytext></report>
