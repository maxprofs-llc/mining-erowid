I just recently cut back on smoking weed, too much short term memory loss. I started using Ginko &amp; Phosphatedtidyserine to help my memory as well as combat my very annoying lifelong allergies, what I felt has been nothing short of a miracle. My Allergies has lessened alot and so has my athsma and I can remember alot better. I had got this product from the company I work for and man I would not go a day without it. It gives me a energized euphoric feeling that I've never felt from anything.</bodytext></report>
