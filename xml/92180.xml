I took 70 mg methoxetamine after repeated uses over several weeks.  I always allowed 7 days before re-use.

I took the 70 mg IM and in 10 minutes was going under.  I usually would dissolve into  a point of consciousness watching the universal mechanisms of the foundation of the universe.   This time though I went much deeper. I just kept going deeper and deeper into the fabric of the universe, through the loom, the threads, the molecules of the threads, and onward.  I was aghast with my unworthiness to be where I was, so deep into the secrets of everything.  It was nearly unbearable in its intensity.  Yet, I did not long for it to end.  I was willing to cease my existence in exchange for this satori.

When I finally came out of it, I texted a friend, 'I have breathed the breath of God.  And I am a humbler man for it.'  Soul shaking!  I feel no immediate need to revisit.  How can that be topped!!</bodytext></report>
