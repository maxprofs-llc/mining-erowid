Background - I am in college and am 22 years old. I am one of those people who never has to worry about their weight - and have maintained my weight +/-10 lb for the last 8 or so years. I go to bed at 2am every night and I smoke weed every day pretty much all the time unless I have work/classes/homework, and I wake up at 730am on m-t-r and go to work for a property mgmt. company helping around the office, walking/inspecting buildings, and help maintenance and and leasing. I wake up at around 9 on t-f and at 12-2 on weekends.

I had just gotten 200 100mg pills online 2 weeks ago and had been taking it every day during this time, staying up 1 or 2 nights a week. I had only tried modafinil 3 times before I ordered it, once staying all night for an exam and twice when going to ac and playing poker.

When I took it for an exam the first time it was amazing, I took 400mg at around 8 and stayed up the entire night studying with no problems. It was amazing, with no side effects other than slight jitteryness and a faster heart rate which was fine because I usually have very low bpm. I studied the whole night for 2 exams one science and one business, and when I got the exam in front of me information just flowed out of my head faster than I've ever experienced, as I'm usually nervous when taking exams and very often get frustrated with problems when it comes to math and formulas.

When I took it for gambling it helped to stay attentive and focused, but I wasn't any better, but it does raise my tolerance to alcohol significantly. I think I drank 8-10 jack and cokes (one every 10-20 minutes or so) one night and did not feel drunk in the slightest at any point and slept fine.

So I have been taking them every day and on Sunday one week I had an exam the next morning in a chemistry, having never studied or read chapters past what I needed to do for homework which actually I find incredibly easy to do for chemistry and manage to beat the class average every time. I take 200mg and cram the whole night and take the exam no problem, but something in me wanted to see how far I could go, so I took another 200mg in the morning, repeating this about every 8 hours for the next three day.

Now, when staying up even one night I start to get hallucinations, they are only prominent when my surroundings are dark and do not really manifest during the day minus some points where I maybe see something move really fast in my peripheral vision. On Monday and Tuesday I went to work and on Monday it went fine but on Tuesday but there were a couple points in the morning where I would just fall asleep for 1-2 seconds standing up or sitting doing something, then I would startle awake once I realized I'm sleeping, thankfully nobody saw. I felt just as tired on Monday as I did on Tuesday, but on Tuesday once I got home from work I fell asleep for two hours and then woke up for no apparent reason, took more modafinil and went on.

During Monday night as I was on my computer sitting in the dark I'd noticed the hallucinations getting worse (aka more awesome), when looking at computer screen stuff would just start moving, it was crazy. Every still picture I looked at suddenly started becoming animated, playing out exactly what the pictures should be doing. When looking at a forum with avatars for instance it was even better, with everyone's avatars moving around and doing what they should be no matter how crazy. During Tuesday night there was a point where I was standing in the middle of my almost pitch black room except for one window who was letting some light shine on my dvd collection in the closet when I noticed a demon on the back of one of the covers. It had faint red eyes and a indistinct shape although it was just as big as the dvd cover. It slowly melted off of the cover and jumped out of my closet onto the floor when I realized I was imagining it, but it did scare me a bit

On Wednesday morning I started noticing another side effect in my throat. For some reason either my tongue got bigger or my throat widened or something, but when I swallowed I started to swallow my uvula which made the feeling of a large lump in my throat that I couldn't swallow. It lasted for about 6 hours then went away and it was damn annoying. I had to go to class at 10 and made it there just fine, when I got there and had to focus on the distant board and teacher I found it absolutely impossible to focus. I was blinking and rubbing my eyes like a madman but nothing helped, I probably looked crazy.

I would find myself freezing in slumped positions and found it very hard to make my body move out of it. I also had incredible drymouth much much worse than pot and make it impossible to talk. There were multiple points where I just froze and stared at something then snapping out of it as if I was sleeping. It was 100% like falling asleep with my eyes wide open, I would remember nothing that happened during that time and did not even know if I closed my eyes. Once I left class that all stopped and I could focus once again just fine. I got home and fell asleep on the couch sometime after eating dinner (10pm), eating made me VERY tired while being awake for long periods of time.

Now I had work the next day and fell asleep setting no alarm, and thank GOD I woke up at 8:30 for some reason. I fucking sprung awake in a panic knowing subconsciously that I had to get up, it was nuts. I rushed to get myself together and made it to work on time. I stopped taking modafinil for the next week and now I continue taking it every other day without incident</bodytext></report>
