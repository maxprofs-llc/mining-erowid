One day I was bored and had no money for weed, so I thought I would try to trip off some passionflower. I had some dried passionflower, about a quarter ounce by weight. I made it into a tea that was translucent orange. It tasted gross so I drank it down with two cups of coffee.

After about 10 minutes I felt very hyper as if I drank a double shot espresso. After another 15 minutes of bouncing off walls, I got disoriented, almost a drunk feeling. I sat down and relaxed as I came down. But the disorientation got stronger and with closed eyes could see some color patterns. After 5 minutes with my eyes closed I could see colors changing with my eyes open, mainly purples greens and yellows. After the colors stopped I felt like I had worn off from a marijauna high (tired, muscles relaxed). That lasted for about 20 minutes. It was a good high for just some tea and coffee.</bodytext></report>
