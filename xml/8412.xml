My friend brought a brand of duster of my house called 'end duster' from where he works.  It said it's gas was 1,1,2 or 4 tetra - something - ethane.  I decided to do it even though a website I read said to do chlorodiflouromethane or something else instead. So up at my neighborhood pool, I held the can upright, put my mouth on the opening and took 6 deep breaths of it.  In about 10 seconds, my body felt like it was on nitrous.  I was tripping.  I heard a ringing sound in my head, there were psychedelic patterns around, and when I walked, I felt my body drop between my legs with each step I took.  This stuff started to wear off awfully quickly.

I then started to hate my life.  My body feel micro pinches in random places, and I felt like some sort of a poison was floating through me.  I was paranoid about fucking up my brain for the rest of my life, because I was thinking about my uncle who stares off every time you talk to him, maybe due to the inhalants he did as a teen.  I couldn't think as clearly as I normally could, and I'm still feeling a little stupid even though it's been 5 hours.  I pray I didn't REALLY fuck up my brain for life, or maybe I'm just paranoid after seeing an 'anti-drug' commercial about inhalants.

By the way, I took vitamin B-12 when I got home, since the effects were most similar to that of nitrous.

If you have a brain to waste, go ahead.  But I don't recommend this crap for other ambitious 16 year olds who want to be able to think clearly in life.  There are better drugs out there for you.</bodytext></report>
