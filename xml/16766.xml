I am suffering from narcolepsia nad have therefore been treated with Ritalin, which is a drug similar to methamphetamin, for 8 years. Approximately four months ago I met a guy who was trained in chinese medicine and he told me that I could maybe substitute the ritalin with a herb called ephedra. I gave it a shot, and found to my surprise that the ephedra worked, and in a much more psychologically comfortable way. Now I am no longer on Ritalin daily, and I only take it in weekends when I'm out partying. I thought that this might be helpful for others suffering from narcolepsia.</bodytext></report>
