I got two tabs of Mirtazapin 15mg from a friend to treat my insomnia and decided to start with taking one of them in the evening, about half an hour before going to sleep.

It pretty much knocked me out when I lay down in my bed, which is very uncommon for me, as I usually lie awake in my bed for a few hours before I go to sleep. I slept for 7 hours, then woke up to pee, afterwards I went back to sleep and slept another 5 hours, I had no hangover at all.

The sleep was refreshing but I had twice very vivid (and one lucid) dreams during which I had to fight with a baseball bat against multiple attackers who had bats as well.

The friend who gave me the tabs later told me that he had a dream in which he stabbed somebody with a knife, so vivid violent dreams seem to be pretty common.

When I took the second tab I slept great as well and had lucid dreams, which did not contain anything violent or nightmarish.</bodytext></report>
