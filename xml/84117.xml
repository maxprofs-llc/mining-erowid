I'm an extreme opiate addict and have a very long history of abuse but this is about this single experience. I inject half an eight mg Subutex twice a day for the past two months and quit 50 hours ago.  Now I came up on some Percocet and since I haven't been high for months decided to take all of them equal to 75mg Oxycodone and after waiting 50 hours since my last sub dose I pop the Oxys 10 min start to feel warm. 25 min start to feel slightly high like I would off of 30mg Oxy if I had not done opiates in a week or more. 45 min starting to peak and it feels like a good 40mg Oxy high should, very disappointing I should have waited longer so I could have gotten a full 75mg high but I have certainly learned my lesson.</bodytext></report>
