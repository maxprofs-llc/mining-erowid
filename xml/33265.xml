I have suffered from Narcolepsy for over thirty years. Stimulants are a must for me. Prescribed amounts of Ritalin, adderrall, etc always fall a little short and require an OTC boost from caffiene, ephedrine or adrenaline. Provigil is no exception. What is truly different, large doses of Ritalin etc quickly leads to a tolerance making a single pill ineffective. Provigil has a reverse tolerance up to a point. Even after 4 yrs non-stop of Provigil =&gt;, the first 200mg pill of the day is always noticeable. Around 6 in the morning I usually awake to use the restroom; this is when I take my first pill and go back to bed. 7:30 or so I wake up; and the best way to describe the feeling is from the MOTEL SIX commercial where the fellow wakes up proclaiming 'I'm in a good mood; and I slept like a baby!!'.</bodytext></report>
