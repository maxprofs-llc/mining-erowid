I had been smoking weed for about a year and a half when I decided to try LSD.  I became hooked on it immediately.  I loved the high.  I used frequently, about twice a week, for almost a year.  I realize now that I had many bad trips, but I never realized at the time that it could be the acid doing what it did to me.  I would experience great feelings of anxiety and paranoia.  It even got to the point where I would experience minor hallucinations when I wasn't high.  I talked to a good friend of mine about it and he said he experiences the same thing and told me to just ignore it.  Thank god I didn't listen to him.  I knew I had to quit.

I quit doing acid and just stuck to weed for a while,  I stuck to weed for a while but realised the feeling weren't going away, even when I wasn't high I felt them.  Time to quit everything.  It was over a year before the feelings went away, it was very gradual.  It was during that year that I learned that any mind altering agent brought these effects on stronger.  I was helping a buddy paint a store and started getting affected by the paint fumes and had to leave him to finnish on his own.

Finally about 2 and a half years later I was free from these feelings (so I thought)  I decided one day that I was gonna test the waters when someone offered me a joint.  After just a haul or two off the joint and the feelings came rushing back.  I knew then that I would have to stay drug free if I wanted these feelings to be gone for good.  I haven't experienced these feelings since.  Painting and minor toxins no longer bother me, although I've only tested them in short bursts.  I'm not brave enough to test out prolonged exposure.

It took me a long time to openly admit to other people what I had gone through, for fear of disbelief mainly I guess.  I eventually opened up though and am glad for doing so.  I have to say though, I don't regret any of what I did or what happened to me.  I believe I learned a lot about people, life (morals,etc.) and most importatly myself from all of it.  So again I don't regret it, but I don't recommend it either.</bodytext></report>
