I took 0.5 mg of Bromo Dragonfly and it took about 4 hours to come on. After a couple of hours I didn't think it was going to work. I began to get a slight feeling in my head. Not really good or bad, some people I imagine may become nauseous by this, but it didn't bother me.  There was a very slow build up over a period of hours where the visuals were slowly increasing in intensity. They were not as strong as acid in terms of dose for dose. I would describe Bromo as a gentle acid trip that lasts for almost 24 hours.

During the trip my thinking was totally interconnected and I was able to think to a certain degree, holographically, thinking about everything all at once and focusing on what I felt was important at the time. It was a great aid in terms of understanding, however no more so than I would describe any other psychedelic that I have taken. I would advise having a very good night sleep before taking this because it goes on for a long such a long time. The benefit depending on reasons for taking it is the extended period of time that one has to think and focus on ones desired subject matter.

To conclude. Everything about this drug is gentle, it is like a wave that rises and falls very slowly. Or to put it another way it is the psychedelic polar opposite of DMT.</bodytext></report>
