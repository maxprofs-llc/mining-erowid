I have been ill with bronichitis for 2 weeks and ended up drinking a whole bottle of Dextromehtorphan. I started hallucinting - I had thought the people were trying to feed me metal and turn me into a toy metal robot. I went to the ER and ended up testing positive for PCP - I have not used an illegal drug in 20 years and have NEVER used PCP. The sample was taken through a rapid urine tox screen. I insisted that it couldn't be true and so they sent the specimen out to a lab to have it tested further.</bodytext></report>
