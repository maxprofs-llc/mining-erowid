Approximately a year in a half ago was the first time I smoked marijuana; I was 16 and it was my sophomore year. Marijuana put me in a better mood, gave me energy, and also increased my focus and concentration. I began smoking once a day, which gradually increased to several times a day.  For about half a year I was a heavy user, smoking about 4-5 times a day.

Unfortunately (or fortunately), I'm not able to smoke pot at all anymore, because I began getting this devestating allergic reaction.  These past 6 months I've smoked less than 10 times, yet each time I smoke I get the same reoccuring symptoms.  The symptoms feel as if my throat is swelling up, it also becomes difficult to breathe. The doctor said there was a lot of sinus drainage in my throat.  When he prescribed me antibiotics it knocked out the sinus infection fast, but of course I still have this terrible reaction to marijuana smoke.

My hopes are, eventually this allergy will pass and I will be able to enjoy being high again, without throat irritations.  Now, if I eat pot I don't have this kind of reaction, so it must be from the smoke.  As of now, since I don't enjoy alchohol a whole lot, I'm going to have to enjoy my recreational use of mushrooms and LSD.</bodytext></report>
