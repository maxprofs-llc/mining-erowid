I was stuck at home on a friday night and I figured I'd make the best of it and have a little party with myself.  I looked around the house and located a bottle of Irish Cream (60 proof).  I poured myself a tall glass full with the intentions of chugging it.  However I got sidetracked and went looking for a gram of regs I had left over from a session with my best friend the day before.

I found the marijuana and surveyed that I didnt have anything at hand to smoke out of because I lent my bowl to a friend of mine.  So I grabbed my pack of cigarettes and began to pinch out about half of the tobacco in 5 cigarettes.  I later filled the half empty cigarettes with the finely ground marijuana and smoked them throughout the evening, about 8-11.

At 11pm I drank the liquor and smoked a cigarette and was ready to sit back and relax.  The mood was so lifted and despite being stranded alone at home, I was having a blast of a time.  This isnt such an extraodinary event, im sure many people do things similar to this.  I do it whenever I have the necessary ingredients and im home alone or bored.  As simple as it may seem, these three substances when used together have such a perfect harmony.  Whatever the chemical reasons may be, at the same time, all three create an ideal euphoria.

I sat back and relaxed as all of my worries drifted away and I turned on the television so I could drift off into whatever movie I began to watch.  I smoked a few more of these very strong cuban cigarettes I had left over from a recent trip to mexico.  Each time I smoked I got the smallest, most perfect lift back into my state of bliss.  All in all, what posed to be a boring and dull night turned into what couldnt have any more fun.</bodytext></report>
