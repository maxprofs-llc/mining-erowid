12:50AM
/n
-------
/n
        OK, so its actually the 18th now. So what. I haven't gone to sleep
/n
yet, so its the 17th as far as I'm concerned. Anyway...
/n
        I have 2.5 tablets of Propacet, each containing 50mg of 
/n
dextropropoxyphene. They're the last of a batch of 8 of them that I was
/n
given. I ingest all of them. I had smoked a little cannabis earlier, still
/n
feel a lingering effect, but am close to baseline.
/n
/n
1:09AM
/n
------
/n
        I begin to feel a hint of opiate feel kicking in. I also seem to
/n
be feeling random itches all over my body, but they are easy to ignore.
/n
This is a typical opiate alert for me. I feel slightly warm, a little
/n
'floaty,' and real calm. Not much else yet. Narcotics seem to take a long
/n
time to take effect orally.
/n
/n
1:21AM
/n
------
/n
        The itching passed several minutes ago. But other than that, there
/n
has been no change. I almost even feel closer to baseline than at my last
/n
check-in. I'm yawning a little now though.
/n
/n
1:45AM
/n
------
/n
        Well, I definitely feel 'something' - basically the same as I have
/n
been feeling, but its moved up a level of intensity. Its tempting at this
/n
point to smoke some cannabis to bring on the effects. I'm holding off
/n
though, so I can get a good description of an unclouded dextropropoxyphene
/n
experience. But damn... this slow come on time is a negative in my
/n
opinion. I would hate to have to wait this long if I were using it for
/n
pain relief!
/n
/n
2:10AM
/n
------
/n
        T+1:20 and it still hasn't really kicked in yet. This is taking an
/n
unusually long time. I haven't eatin in 11 hours or so, so my stomach
/n
wasn't full. I feel slightly more than I did at last check-in. Same
/n
effects again, just a little stronger. A kind of warm tingly sensation
/n
diffused throughout my upper body and somewhat in my legs. A feeling of
/n
calmness. Somewhat quieted thought processes. But I'm not yet feeling the
/n
euphoria or the 'buzz' yet.
/n
/n
2:15AM
/n
------
/n
        As I typed that last paragraph, things did jump up a level. The
/n
body tingles increased alot, and spread all over my body. There is some
/n
tinnitus in my ears now. Every now and then I get random itches, which has
/n
been going on since I felt the first hint of effects. I'm developing a
/n
decent 'buzz' and some euphoric sensations now as well. 
/n
/n
2:30AM
/n
------
/n
        Things still seem to be building, but I'm at a pretty decent level
/n
now. I feel typical opiate effects, though sort of mild. As I said,
/n
narcotics are very different from other CNS depressants. Its hard to
/n
compare this high to something like GHB or alcohol.
/n
        I feel a little warm, its a pleasant warmth. My body feels a sort
/n
of tingly, floaty sensation. I feel much lighter than usual. I don't feel
/n
like moving around at all. I tried to lay down, though, and that wasn't
/n
noticably more comfortable than sitting in my computer chair or standing.
/n
It doesn't seem to matter what position I'm in, I'm equally comfortable.
/n
Its a comfortableness that seems to come primarily from not caring about
/n
things that might normally make me uncomfortable. My thought processes are
/n
slow... I'm a verbal thinker, and the voice in my mind is much quieter
/n
than normal. Its not that thought is impaired, I *can* think if I want
/n
to... it just seems nicer to not think though. Opiates are a very
/n
detatched high. You just want to float around feeling calm, not doing or
/n
thinking. Its not that you feel unusually happy - you just feel mentally
/n
relaxed and physically good. Personally I find it sort of boring, but I
/n
can see how this state would appeal to alot of people, especially those
/n
with escapist tendencies. Music is slightly enhanced. Orbital's 'Halcyon
/n
On &amp; On' sounds prettier than usual, and goes well with the floaty
/n
sensations. Other minor effects... I have dry mouth, but its different
/n
than cannabis 'cottonmouth.' I was pretty hungry before I took the pills.
/n
The hunger vanished within a half hour or 45 minutes or so and hasn't
/n
returned. The itching is still somewhat there, but its so easy to ignore
/n
as to be a non-issue. Its concentrated on my scalp, face and arms now,
/n
though, whereas earlier it was all over. My juice tastes bland.
/n
/n
2:50AM
/n
------
/n
        Its been 2 hours... peak plasma concentrations of
/n
dextropropoxyphene are supposedly reached at 2-2.5 hours, and I do feel as
/n
though I've gotten as far as I'm going to. There doesn't seem to be
/n
anymore sensation of increase in the effects. I'm kind of bored of the
/n
high already. Narcotics just don't do all that much for me on their own.
/n
I've been wanting to smoke some cannabis, but haven't yet because I wanted
/n
to write an accurate report of an unclouded narcotic high. I think I've
/n
accomplished that.
/n
/n
3:00AM
/n
------
/n
        I smoke some cannabis. One hit from my glass pipe and I'm already
/n
feeling much nicer. Yes, I think this is what was needed.
/n
/n
3:15AM
/n
------
/n
        The cannabis made a huge difference. I can feel the effects of
/n
both blended into a fuller high than the dextropropoxyphene alone. The
/n
cannabis also made me think more vocally again, and the combination makes
/n
mellow music AMAZING! It is making me a little sleepy though. Neither drug
/n
seems to dominate the high, its an even synergy, at least at these
/n
dosages.
/n
/n
3:45AM
/n
------
/n
        I feel much the same as before, but the narcotic aspect of the
/n
high is starting to taper off ever so slightly. I'm pretty tired and plan
/n
to go to bed soon. This was interesting to actually document a narcotic
/n
experience, but I've never really been a big fan of this class of drug.
/n
I'd definitely do it again if I was given some more, although I'd combine
/n
it right off with cannabis. Ah well...</bodytext></report>
