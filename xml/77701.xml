I have been a recreational user of dxm for about 7 months now. I would say I am psychologically addicted. There have been periods of time where I discontinued my use of it, for about a month last October, and currently. I am also a frequent consumer of alcohol. Lately I never seem to feel drunk at all that is until the point where Im puking my guts up. I originally chalked this up to tolerance, being as I drink a lot. But it didnt make sense to me that I didnt feel that drunk no matter how much alcohol I consumed.

I havent consumed dxm in over a month because I felt it was destroying my social life. I would stay home on Friday nights instead of going out with friends because I got more kicks out of dxm. I was also getting sick all the time and hurting my relationship with my mom. So I quit. But the really big plus side to it all is...
