This is by far the best ethno I have tried.  I have tried Kava and Amanitas, and this is the only thing I got any reaction from.  Here is my experience.

I am an occasional opiate user, hyrdocodone (Vicodin) 7.5/750.  I usually take 2-3 pills at a time.

I got home from work and I made this mixture.

10 oz coffee mug, filled with warm water, and added 1.5 heaping teaspoons of powdered Kratom to the mix.  Drank straight.  It tasted ok, better than most of the other stuff.  I compare it to eating grass.  It did not taste bad, but took about 4 more glasses of water to rinse all of the powder out of the glass.

About 20 minutes later, I had the exact same feeling that hydro gives me.  A rush to the head, a flushed feeling, and a strong euphoria.  It mimicked Hydro exactly.  I may have taken a tad too much, because I had a slight queasy feeling.  It was very similar to taking a little too much hydro, but was easily tolerated.  I ate on it, no problem.  I also suggest drinking a lot of water while on it.  It seems to make you feel better and it does seem to make you a bit dehydrated.

To me, this is one of the best things I could have found.  It gives me a great euphoric feeling, I can function fine, no clumsiness or any other adverse side effects, nausea was minimal, and it lasted about 4 hours.  Coming down is really no big deal.  I was very tired, but it could have just been that it was 1:00 am.  I slept well, and woke up with no lasting effects.</bodytext></report>
