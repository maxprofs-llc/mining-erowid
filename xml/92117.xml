Background on me Im an artist living in New Zealand, where cannabinoids are now class D, which means anyone over 18 can purchase and consume them. Cannabis is class C, weird laws, but great for consumers. I got this in the mail from the USA.

t- 5 coming on strong a lot like JWH-018. General stimulated stoning very much like sativa cannabis. Anxiety is present this dose is too high for a beginner this is strong in your face high. My mind is racing being chased by a general anxiety in my head. Is something wrong? Nothing is this dose was too high for a comfortable stone. Use 3-6 mg next time. A lot stronger than JWH-073 and JWH-018 in effects, Im totally blasted.

t- 10-  A++ rising euphoria reality is blinking in and out very strobe now its more euphoric. Its quite like a longer lasting JWH-250. The same trippy feeling coming up but now its leveled to a nice stoned body relaxed. Music sounds good. This is pretty strong cannabinoid. It feels like a higher dose of the usual ones. Im interested to how the duration is on this one. No dry mouth but anxiety as parents are headed home. I cant be stoned here. Feeling passed. No red eyes. Few. And its like strong herb, like  my first experience with weed not knowing what would happen.

Well chest feeling weird, heart ok. It seems common but also this was a higher than usual dose. I wanted to see the pronounced feelings this gave. Also I hate not having a scale. This is settled to a very body high music sounded awesome. Trippy high its up down up. Thoughts are scattered eyes feeling heavy fingers way colder. The experience and duration is very surprising as Ive tried most the other JWH-. Its been 1 hrs since the pipe it feels like 10 hours later. Its dying down now. Its like a medium mellow high. Still euphoric eating cornflakes is better than usual. Mind a lot more relaxed now.

1.30 hrs. Well, conclusion: its like a sativa indica strain very potent long-lasting more potent than JWH-018 or JWH-250 by weight. A mind stimulated chem at first then settles to a nice relaxed body stone. Not too much euphoria but a strong stoned feeling. Its still going on so duration is a good one. Does have some physical effects like chest pain that worried me but it was a lot to do with dose so aim low with this one to avoid Im guessing a lot of physical discomfort.</bodytext></report>
