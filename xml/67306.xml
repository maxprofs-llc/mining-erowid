I have little experience with tripping on Salvia, and no experience with tripping on LSD. I had developed a bit of control with my Salvia trips, so I thought I would take the leap of tripping for a great deal of time on a more powerful psychoactive drug.

I crushed ten seeds and chewed them for about two minutes at about 6:30 PM. Soon after, the first hour of my experience, I felt a warming sensation in my head. It was distinct enough to tell that this was not just wishful thinking, but that the seeds were doing something. During the course of that hour, ever so often I would feel a flash of what seemed like insanity for less than half of a second. From what I had heard about LSD experiences and the fact that LSA was very similar, I was expecting to have a very color and unique trip unlike anything I had ever experienced.

After a half hour or so of this warming sensation and brief glimpses of insanity, I thought I could help the LSA trip begin by using Salvia. I sat at my desk and inhaled too very deep breaths of Salvia, holding both breaths inside my lungs as long as I possibly could. In a matter of seconds I was a in a new mind. I was still in my room, the TV was still on the same program, and for the most part, everything in my room was how it should be. The only exception was that I felt the presense of many beings in the room. I didn't question their lack of body and voice, but rather I 'just' knew they were there. These beings have appeared in other Salvia trips I've had. I often speak to them, and when I'm having a bad trip, I yell. When I'm having a bad trip, I tell the beings that I'm not going to give in and panic because panicing is what they want.

After I regained my normal state of mind, the warming sensation was gone, and I began to feel a bit of nausea. I called my friend with whom I've previously used Salvia and told him of these effects I was feeling. They were mild, and I didn't have much to say. I still seemed intrigued, though, because I had mentioned the seeds' capabilites in the past. So, concluding the conversation, he told me to call him if I felt anything more.

After about an hour or more of intense nausea, I started to experience a feeling of well being. At first I assumed I was only feeling good because the nausea was subsiding. I didn't want to lead myself on, thinking that the seeds were beginning to take effect. After about 20 minutes of this feeling intensifying I concluded that this was indeed effects from the seeds. This intense feeling lasted from about 9:00 PM until 3:00 AM. At the time, I remember thinking to myself 'euphoria, euphoria, euphoria.' Although there were no visual hallucinations during this trip, my hearing became incredibly perceptive. There were three sounds in my room at the time: the TV, the ceiling fan, and the fan inside my laptop. I could hear each sound individually and incredibly accurately. Every so often the very suttlely volumed fan inside my laptop would stop running, and I would immediately take notice. The absense of this sound would make me feel completely different. My body seemed to keep releasing chemicals that heightened my mood, yet I felt 100% different.

At about 1:00 AM, I really wanted to go to sleep. My body felt completely drained of energy, and my eye lids were very heavy. I went to the bathroom before I attempted to go to sleep like I always do. My mind was completely clear at the time, but I walked and moved as if I were drunk. Stumbling along the way, I made it to the bathroom. I looked into the mirror, and my everlasting smile grew dramaticly. The green rings in my eyes were a very thin hair line, while the rest was clouded by a deep, black pupil. I laid my head down to rest, but realized that sleep was far from possible in spite of my incredible fatigue. My mind was racing. I couldn't control the presense of song, nor could I subdue the tapping of my fingers to the beat.

I began to grow frustrated with my active mind. I grew increasing worried that these euphoric feels would never cease, while at the same time I was still completely consumed in happiness. At about 2:00 AM the effects began to diminish, and I fell asleep a little after 3:00 AM. I was utterly exhausted, yet I laid in darkness for over two hours before falling asleep.

My trip was characterized soley by intense euphoria. Over the course of the six hours I thought about many things that would normally upset me, but my mood could not be altered. The smile on my face could not be wiped away. I tried many times to hold a straight face, but I could not succeed for more than ten seconds. I have had many good days through my life time, but no moment could compare to what I felt every second of this trip. This was a kind of happiness that could not be achieved with chemical induction.

One would think such an incredible experience would yield a hefty price. I felt no comedown of any kind the following day. The only price I paid was about $20 for 50 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. Although I felt no visual hallucinations whatsoever like I had expected, I fully intend to repeat this experiment.</bodytext></report>
