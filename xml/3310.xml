I took dex (1/2 a box of Coricidin) last night at a friday the thirteenth party with a friend.  Everyone said that it was an ok drug and so I thought it would be ok.  And I didnt think it could be so bad cause it was cough and cold medicine.  I had never robotripped or anything before.

Well I took it and at first I was fine, I had a margarita before I took the pills but I didnt worry about it, stupid me.  I got so confused and I just knew I would die.  I could feel my body deteriorating.  It was horrible.  And to make it worse I knew about my best friend taking it too and I couldnt find her.  Some guy had taken her to her car and made sure she was ok.  I was with a guy, a really good friend, and I like him a lot.  He tried to take care of me for a little while.  I was so confused and I couldnt breathe.  I caught myself so many times not breathing.  My blood was freezing and I could feel it thru my skin.  I could not keep warm.  Then I would get this overwhelming sense of hot.  It was like I kept going in and out of this trip, but it wasnt good at all.  I only wanted it to leave me alone.

I kept crying and going crazy so I went and lied down in a bedroom and I felt I had to go to the bathroom really bad.  I went and it was horrible.  Everything that came out was like a boiling liquid.  I was so scared. My stomach hurt so bad.  I locked the door and took a bath, I felt a little better but I was so nauseous I couldnt see straight.  Literally.  I had no sense of direction and I felt I was away from myself like when I went in and out of the trip when I was out I felt fine and I could think but I still knew I would die.  When I went back into it I went to the bathroom and let myself do what my body had to do which was shit out a lot of liquid nasty stuff.  It was kind of like vomiting out of your ass but the stuff was so hot.  I had a very high fever and I couldnt take it.

I decided to try to sleep and I tried but I kept coming in and out of this trip.  I kept falling into sleep but I would catch myself not breathing so I woke up and made myself breath.  I was also on prescription depression drugs and no one told me about it...I thought I was going crazy. I was so out of control I had lost it.  I knew I wouldnt wake up, so I let myself go.  I knew I wouldnt live no matter what so I just let it go... I cried and cried, but I finally fell asleep and I woke up early this morning and had my friend bring me home and I am babysitting while I am writing this...I will never do that shit again. And I am thankful for my life.  And my best friends... Well I scared myself and everyone else last night.</bodytext></report>
