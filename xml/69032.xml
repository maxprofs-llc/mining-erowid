I am not really sure about how much I took. My friend just gave me a capsule that looked about half full. I ingested the drug at about 6:05 and don't feel anything until about 6:30 when I start getting butterflies in my stomach. Slight euphoria starts coming over me but the butterflies get worse, like there is a giant ball of energy inside my stomach. This feeling is very uncomfortable but it starts to subside and is gone by about 7:30 . During this time everything around me is more interesting and has a life of it's own. I am in a very happy mood. Me and my friends (who were both on AMT) put some music on. Layered music was amazing on this drug as I could hear every instrument being played in the song as well as the song as a whole. No visual hallucination's just yet but everything looks different than it did while not on the drug.

At around 8:00 we decide to walk to our dealers house to pick up some pot. It is a beautiful winter night out with a clear sky and snow on the ground. I feel the happiest I've ever been on the walk there, still no real hallucinations but the trees hanging above our heads look magnificent. We get to the dealers house just as my high starts to peak. She tells us to come in and sit down so we do. It's like as soon as I sat down on the couch a wave hit me in the face. The walls and everything around me starts swirling and distorting. I can't keep myself from laughing hysterically. The movie transformers is playing on the TV. The picture is very wavy and colors are distorted some. The sound coming from the TV is speeding up and slowing down, this was really strange. All of a sudden the peoples faces on the movie look like someone is slowly going over them with a paintbrush, turning the movie into a moving painting.

We finally get our weed and walk into the entryway (at this point I am thinking pot is not such a good idea for me). We walk outside and it's about 9:00 (turns out we were in there for almost an hour). We are in a sort of sketchy part of town that I don't feel that comfortable in but my friend insists on going into a corner store to get some gum. When we are in there there is a man that seems to be pointing at bread asking for ice cream cake. He and the store owner are in some kind of argument so I decide to leave the store and wait for my friends outside. At this point I was very uncomfortable and want to go home. As soon as we're out of there I feel a lot better and we walk home. I am still feeling very euphoric but the  visual peak of my experience had passed. As soon as we get back I lay down on my bed with a blanket and pillow and curl up into a ball. I am not sleepy at all but was the most comfortable I've been in my life. I lay there for almost 2 hours (by this time it is around 12:00-1:00) my friends had been smoking some pot and now they were at the peak of their trips.

I smoke a couple bowls but this just seemed to make me sleepy. We then walked my friend home  and got back at around 2. I am not putting much detail into these final hours because nothing really new or exiting was happening, I just felt very happy. We went to bed at around 3 or 4 but I only got 4 or 5 hours of sleep. I think the pot helped me sleep more though.

Overall good experience. I only really wish that the hight of my trip wasn't at my dealers house in a sketchy part of town.</bodytext></report>
