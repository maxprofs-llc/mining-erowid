I bought an ISI whipped cream maker and a 24 pack of nitrous.  It was a lot of fun, to be honest.  Not worth the $35 for the maker and the $15 for the nitrous, but I wanted more anyway.

I went through 2 subsequent 24 packs in a week or so.  I noticed I would be short of breath and was coughing a lot more, especially when smoking.  I finished a 24 pack a while ago and noticed some black shit on the nozzle.  I hadn't opened it in a while and remember reading an earlier erowid report on how there was sludge in N20 containers.  I opened the whipped cream maker and noticed there the inside was covered in a thin brown/black gel.  I suspect it was 'best whip' brand that was largely responsible, since that was the brand i bought the most of.  I also purchased ISI brand as well.  I notice acute respiratory problems, but maybe it will pass.

Nitrous is like a cock tease anyway: just as soon as I get into it I lose it.  Anyway, I realize this isn't the most scientific account, but I'm also not making anything up either.  The bottom line is there's residue in whippets that probably accumulate in the lungs.  By the way, this all took place from thanksgiving till slightly after New years.</bodytext></report>
