One night I really felt like taking something so I searched through my cupboards for something that would affect my sleep. I found some pills called 'Valused'. They're supposed to help with sleep and nervous tension. I took a look at the instructions. They said to take 1-3 pills half an hour before sleep. I was randomly wondering if it was powder or liquid that was in the pills so I cut one open. It was in fact a brown, smelly, liquid. So I swallowed the open pill. I got drowsy pretty quickly after that, I'm guessing because the pill was open hence no time release. Soon after that I took 4 more.

I sat around for a bit, cleared my mind, and got ready to go to sleep. When I finally went to bed I immediately started to fell my body numb slightly and tingle. It was a bit strange and uncomfortable. Then I got this feeling of weightlessness for a while. Usually it takes me a while to fall asleep but this time I was out within a minute or two. My dreams were extremely vivid that night. I tried to become lucid in these dreams but I think I was too sedated. I had long dreams with complicated plots. In one of the dreams I even died and a moment after I died in the dream I woke up with a strange body high. I quickly went back to sleep and had some more crazy dreams.

I woke up very refreshed and felt like I had been sleeping forever. Valerian is definitely a good way to get a deep sleep. I'm sure the other herbs in the pills contributed to the experience but it I think it was mainly the Valerian.</bodytext></report>
