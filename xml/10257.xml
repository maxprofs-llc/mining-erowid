Back from the grave,
/n
Reborn again.
/n
Dont know how to behave,
/n
Dont know how it began.
/n
/n
In total confusion,
/n
Where I lay.
/n
Lifes an illusion,
/n
A game I play.
/n
/n
Dazed and confused,
/n
I look at the ceiling.
/n
My minds been abused,
/n
But I just love the feeling.
/n
/n
The ceiling is twirling,
/n
The walls only pulse.
/n
The carpet is curling,
/n
But I know its all false.
/n
/n
Stuck in a world,
/n
Parallel to mine.
/n
The colors all swirled,
/n
A vision benign.
/n
/n
I roam around,
/n
Unable to speak.
/n
Falling off the ground,
/n
As I reach my peak.</bodytext></report>
