This story takes place one day on Sunday (September). It was boring that day, so I decided to have fun with three friends of mine... (I would call A, B, C). I made an appointment with my friends outside in a parking near a forest. (If the trip goes wrong).
/n
/n
11.00 AM - I decided to take a blotter that I thought was LSD. Until the trip, we rolled a joint of marijuana and smoked it. I speak a little with my friends, I told them that I could be crazy on acid, so it's important to pay attention on me. We decided to take a walk in the city until the onset (To return to the parking afterwards).
/n
/n
12.00 AM - An hour passes, no effect of the onset occurs. We therefore take the decision to eat a little (We'll look for a sandwich nearby). We return to the parking.
/n
/n
01.00 PM - Two hours later, nothing happens ... I find it boring and decided to take another blotter. Here the biggest mistake of my life =\ My friends are a little disturbed at the idea of taking a second blotter. We are still talking and waiting until the fucking onset... still not there.
/n
/n
02.00 PM - Nothing happens yet. My cell phone vibrates, I receive a message from one who sold me the 'LSD' The message said : 'Hey dude, how are you? No problems I hope? Does everything go well?'
/n
/n
From that moment I knew something was wrong, but too late, I took the blotters, all I had to do is wait. With my friends we ballads, while I walked, I noticed that the ground began to breathe, the onset begin...
/n
/n
02.30 PM - We went to the parking as planned. On the road, the houses began to be in 'painting' as if Van Gogh had painted houses. Then more I walked and I had the impression of entering into the world of the Simpsons Family. Flowers, sky, houses, cars looked like a cartoon, everything was very colorful and sweet, it was really great, I really enjoyed contemplating this landscape is revealed gradually as.
/n
/n
On the road I could see strange Egyptian motifs and sometimes in the sky mathematical equations that loomed in. My vision was very sensitive, I could see very far distant and i could see every detail of each object, flowers, trees around me.
/n
/n
03.00 PM - We finally arrived at the parking. When I entered the parking everything was very mysterious. For example, between the road that separated the parking, it was a magical portal where only those with superior minds have the right to enter. This parking was my sanctuary, my power was over it, and I can control and manage it in my way. The onset was here.
/n
/n
Trees strangely like those of the game Kirby, it was crazy, I could see every detail of the trees were yet very far from me. I could also control the time and changed the colors in my own way, The blue might be green, black could be white, etc.
/n
/n
As for my friends, their faces were filled with emotions, I could read their minds. One was nervous, the other does not seem to understand why I trip. I amused myself with a friend, he was really like Krusty the clown, when I touched him, full of crazy colors coming out of his body. I really enjoyed that moment, I hit well for thirty minutes, it seemed also to have fun.
/n
/n
After a stick of wood drew my attention, I took in my hands and I suddenly found myself in a Viking ship, the parking was a space ship where I had the impression of seeing the water rise from the ground. I shake the stick in my hands to move it. It was really enjoyable.
/n
/n
03.30 PM - My friend asked me if it goes well? They all remarked that I am quite pale and my lips became purple/blue. I did not pay attention, I was so good into the magic world. My friends really wanted me home, so it forces me to go home because for them, I am going wrong and I said stupid shit.
/n
/n
I said to them: Ok we will go home. But then I noticed that the environment became 'graying'. I ask myself full of questions: What will my mother say if she sees me in this state? I was supposed to come back home in 5.00 PM. On the way, I became psychotic and crazy, it had happened in my street where my house was in. Here the objects around me in the city had a 'soul', items were driven to cry.
/n
/n
4.00 PM - So I make a bad trip. I saw my house all dark and aggressive, she wanted me to open the door, the house called me. On exterior windows I could see vicious shadows. My friend leave me at my home. I open the door and my mother was in the hallway, I wanted to dodge her and go up quickly in my bedroom. My mother yells: What happens there? I heard those footsteps on the stairs, my heart fluttered at full speed.
/n
/n
I also had a strange feeling, I quickly teleport in every corner of my room as if my body and my mind wanted to avoid my mother. My mother was there and said: Oh my god, look at your lips, what are you doing? She was upset. I was huddled in a corner of my room. My mother shouted: I'll tell your father (in the living room I heard my father who said: Holy fuck, he took drugs, etc ...).
/n
/n
My father came and told me angry: bastard, little asshole. He wanted to hit me and I started crying, I told him: Sorry Dad, please, sorry I took LSD, excuse me, please. He was fucking upset and he yell to my mum : Called the ambulance quickly he will die ! He was fucking nervous and said me to come in the living room. I follow him and BOUM ! *TOTAL MINDFUCK* He gives me water, I immediately spit out, thinking he wants to poison me. My father tell me I was a fucking shit and totally crazy. My little brother freaked me like hell, he was like : BOO ! And i was bumping of fear. There my father told me to sit down, my mother was in the kitchen and she had called the hospital. I had to be brought to the emergency immediately.
/n
/n
4.30 PM - What I am going to explain is very hard to understand, it would really live the experience to understand it.
/n
/n
I was in the living room, and there I saw my life began to 'scroll' in front of me. I do not know how to explain, but every step I reached that corresponded to a period of my life. From life to death. I really had a great auditory hallucinations from now. For example, my father said: Our son was so good, why has he done this? And when I got up from the chair to go in the car, it was as if I was dead. I was physically dead but mentally present. When I got up out the window I really saw the car as a hearse. When I was in my hallway (to go towards the car), opening the door I saw the neighbors who were sad, and my mum was crying deeply.
/n
/n
When I entered the car, my arms crossed (like a dead people), I was in a hearse. My mother cried a lot. And I heard my parents say: We are going first to the morgue or cemetery? I couldn't speak anymore, i had huge bodyload, i can't feel my body anymore. It was really sad, I really thought I was dead and then I saw the steps, I mean, when someone died he goes first to the morgue and the funeral (with related-friends, family, etc) and finally to the cemetery. Well, for me it was the same. On the way, I saw through the window of the car. I saw my friends with flowers in their hands (it was only pedestrians but as i said, hallucinations were so strong). Throughout the way, I saw all the friends I knew, all the members of my karate club, I really saw the cars of those of my club who was escorting my car to my final destination. Funeral home.... In the street, I knew almost all the people, some crying, I could read all their feelings on their faces.
/n
/n
Arriving at the hospital (the emergency) my father took me by the hand out, I heard the voice again: Come sir, we'll take you, it will not hurt. Arrived at the counters, there was a waiting room next. I then looked into the room and then * BOOM * I saw all the people I knew who looked at me with a sad and helpless feel. Sadness were on their faces. A medic asks me to sit down on a wheelchair to take me in a small room. If you want, the hospital was heaven, and saw that I had died I had access to heaven. In the room the doctor asked me what I took. I replied that I had taken LSD and then *Black Hole* .
/n
/n
A few seconds later, still in the same room, the doctor was gone, I was on a chair. A voice said: It will not hurt. And here I thought they can do nothing and they were going to disconnect from the real world, I thought they were going to 'trip' me for life. I told the doctor sadly : 'But I do not know what is death? It is going to hurt? (I repeat it at least a dozen times). He said : No, it will not hurt, let yourself.
/n
/n
On the door which was at the opposite, I saw the last ten seconds of my life. Every second appeared on door; Everything made sense! I started with the joint, I have not found love, I could not realize my greatest dream of my life (Meet Emma Watson, ya don't blame me). Then I started taking LSD until I die, if you want all started by taking the joint (So I disobey my parents) I don't know how to explain, but it is as if everything had a sense, it was all connected for me to my death. I have reviewed all the moments where it started: My first marijuana smoking at school then the meeting of my best friends, my first trip of LSD in my friends house.... (I'll hope you understand).
/n
/n
As the seconds passed, Heaven grant me to achieve my dreams. For example, to the seventh second I heard the voice of Emma Watson who said: 'Where is he? And then OH MY FUCKING GOD I saw Emma Watson as in my most beautiful dream, she wore a beautiful white dress, her pretty face looking at me, I took her hand and this time she said: it's only the beginning and she disappears with a demonic face (Trust me or not, it's holy shit i don't know very strange).
/n
/n
(In fact I am at funeral, at that time I was in my coffin, I could not move or speak) During the last three seconds this is what I saw:
/n
/n
Third second: I hear a crowd cheering, saying it was a beautiful boy, very sweet, why has he done this?
/n
/n
The second second: I see my love, she is sad and puts a rose on my coffin, someone is next to her, that person holds her his arms. Then she disappears.
/n
/n
The very last second: I hear my father happens to me, I can hear my mother saying: Please do not do that! My dad came to me angry and said: Yes you are a fucking shit and smash me with his foot.
/n
/n
*Black Hole* My mind does not longer exist
/n
/n
I'm back in the real world. A doctor comes to me and said: 'So it was you who ordered a lifetime trip? It will not hurt'. I really feel he injects what I think, a lifetime trip. But the doctor actually just check my blood pressure.
/n
/n
Boom, the trip starts to become even more intense
/n
/n
The whole room begins to warp and moving, the hallucinations are so strong that I fainted.
/n
/n
I have no notion of time, everything is black in my head, I do not care, I must be dead anyway, in fact the death is not so bad.
/n
/n
And here I have auditory hallucinations that big then they are real voices I don't know, I can hear some words such as: blood pressure, heartbeat, too strong, we lose him, injection, cardiograms, constiction, seizures... And i heard the fucking scary voice of the mad guys from 'Who framed roger rabbit?' who say : 'You're fucking dead, yes you are !'
/n
/n
I do not know about what time is, but I find myself in a padded room, I was tripping again but not more agressive than before. I was lying on a bed, in the room I can see the words : L.S.D Beyond Reality moving on the wall.
/n
/n
I stayed two days in hospital under advanced supervision. After this fucking huge trip, I slept for a long time with fears and trembling. When I looked on my phone, the guy who sold me LSD claims me it was Bromo-Dragonfly and said if I was Ok, etc... Now this bastard is probably in jail cause my parents bring me to the police station and cops take my phone....
/n
/n
Conclusion: The Bromo-Dragonfly is a enormously hallucinogenic drug, powerful and very dangerous, doctors have told me they have failed to lose me more than three times, my heart stopped for a few seconds. The dose on the blotters were too high. I nearly die from Bromo-Dragonfly by the way I had light-mild hallucinations for 1 week after the trip... + I suffer from necrosis on my left feet but now it's OK.
/n
/n
Here is what I have or had (now): Necrosis, Latent psychosis, chronic paranoia, heart problem (sometimes I had peak beat), split personality
/n
...
/n
So BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH Bromo-Dragonfly
/n
/n
And also Thank you for listening me and sorry for my fucking bad english, I tried to be as realistic as possible for describe my trip Trust me or not Bromo Dragonfly is a fucking mindfuck...
/n
