The very first time I tried Adderall I was actually looking to score some pain killers or xanax, but when I got to my buddy's house he said he was out but had some Adderall.  At first I wasn't interested but he kinda told me about it and its effects, he said its awesome for working.  So I bought 20 10mg tablets and gave 10 of them to my friend and saved them for work the next morning.  The next day of work was intense!  I was feeling so great and working hard was actually fun!  After work the friend I gave some too called me and said we need more!  By the next week I had gone to see my doctor and swindled my way into getting a prescription for 20mg.  Over the next two months my work performance had doubled and I had gotten two raises because I was working so hard everyday just feeling on top of the world and so focused!  I was convinced that this was a miracle drug!

But of course after taking it for so long I built up a tolerance and I just kept needing more and more to get to the same level.  So I started running out before the month was up and when I would run out I didn't want to work, get out of bed, or even talk to anyone.  So of course I figured out a way to get them refilled early, I would go see my doctor and switch the dosage and make up some excuse and it worked everytime!  It has now been three years and I still to this day have a prescription for 30mg tablets and 20mg XR.  I definatley get serious come-downs but I also got myself a prescription for Xanax 2mg which almost eliminates come-downs.  It makes the anxiety and stress go away and helps me get some sleep.  My doses  now are around 220mg every two days which I would not recommend to anyone.  It is definatley a very addictive drug.</bodytext></report>
