2:15 - 6pm Visuals so strong I cannot see what is acutally infront of me. I know that my wife is there but when I look outside it appears like the visuals I have in the dark when on acid. I cannot hold thoughts for more then a few seconds. I cannot comprehend letters. Everytime I look at my wife and my dog I cry. Nothing matters except them. I feel as though I have taken an ounce of mushrooms. I gag every few minutes. Jesus Christ, 1mg should have been enough. This is in no way, shape, or form, a light dose. I feel that if I have taken more then this that I would have died.

7pm everything is still moving like 5 hits of acid, I am calmer, but all I can do is apologise to my wife. I party maybe once every 5 weeks or so (somtimes not for 3-4 months at a time), but I have conviced myself that I have a drug problem. My wife explains to me that everything is going to be fine, I do not have a problem, its just that this drug blew my mind and fucked with my emotions. It takes me several hours to realize that she is right, but until then I have this fear that I fucked up and her and my dog would be taken away any second.

 I'll stick to shrooms not that the rainy season is comming. 2CT7 is too much. Had I know that was what was going to happen a such a light dose I would have never taken it. I cannot believe that someone would snort 3-4 times what I took orally..</bodytext></report>
