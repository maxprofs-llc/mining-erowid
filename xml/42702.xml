I had heard about Morning Glories from a friend of mine and I grew my own plants last year but when I tried to get high on them they didnt do anything. This year when the seeds came back into the market I bout about 15 grams of Heavenly Blue seeds. I grew about 3 grams of them and they are now getting bigger everyday. The other 12 grams I used to trip on. The process of preparing them was actually a pain in the ass and since I was really afraid of stomach pain and nausea I did whatever I could to take away the chemicals and pesticides.

The 12 grams were about 350 seeds. I soaked them in distilled water for about 3 days, changing the water every few hours. Once the seeds had swelled and the coatings were coming off of them I spent 1 whole Saturday trying to take off the seed coatings, I was able to take off the coatings from about 75% of the seeds. I then let them dry in a cigar box for a couple of days and then I grinded them up in my moms coffee grinder, until they were a fine powder. The powder was cremish colored instead of black or brown because the actual seed is white and the seed coatings of most of them were taken off.

A couple of weeks later my friend came over and we went to see The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. We had bought 2 small cokes and during the beginning of the movie around 7:15 p.m. We had mixed the powder in our drinks. Before we did this we took vitamin c tablets. We each had approximately 5 or 6 grams, and I had heard that this is a very good amount to do. Around 8 the LSA started kicking in but it was like a marijuana buzz. When the movie ended around 9 we stood up and went outside the car, the seeds really kicked in once we stood up and our blood circulated.

In the parking the lights that reflected off the tops of the car were extremely appealing to the eyes and it looked like they had all been polished. We were clearly having visual effects. After a long time we found the car and once I went inside I freaked out and started having recollections of a previous hardcore KB trip and got out of the car immediately. My friend reassured me that it was all right and I got back in the car.

Once we started moving a strange and intense feeling came over me, I felt that seconds would skip and that everything I did would repeat itself 2 or 3 more times, for instance when I would move my hand I would feel like it moved 2 times. The streetlights and car lights had beautiful long streaks and trails coming from them. I was totally out of it, I felt like I wasnt really there and that I wasnt in control of myself. This was not an unpleasant feeling, it was quite euphoric!

We went to a bookstore and went to the bathroom since we both had a strong urge to pee. Once we peed we noticed that our eyes were extremely dilated, we started laughing our asses off about this and went back to the books. While we were leaving the store I hit my head against a shelf really hard but if felt pleasant and I felt no pain, I had a bruise and a bump. During this whole trip I talked a lot and it was all pretty much bullshit. We then went to another store and I dont really remember what we did there but I know that we went to the bathroom again. After that we decided to go to a Burger King and wanted to get whoppers but they were all out and instead we got chicken.

We went to my house and my uncle was home and I was scared he would notice I was trippin on something, so I kept on talking a lot and that probably made him even more suspicious. I didnt eat all my food and I made a big mess with ketchup. After watching the Science behind the Matrix DVD I decided to go to bed before my mom came so I would be asleep, and I thought that once I would lie down the feeling would go away. This was around 11. Lying down did nothing to calm the high down and instead I started seeing a lot more visuals and hallucinations such as the walls being made up of little colorful dots or red and black lines. After an hour of this and not being able to sleep I kept my eyes open with my fingers but it felt like they were closed. I was extremely amused by this for a long time.

After an hour of this I decided to take another piss which was very fun too and I kept on falling against the wall like a drunk. When I went back to bed and tried to sleep I got very annoyed that I was still high and wanted it to go away. Whenever I moved around in my bed it felt like I repeated what I did and it was very annoying. I started to get really worried that maybe this trip wouldnt ever go away because I had heard about everlasting acid trips.

I started to remember things I hadnt remembered in a long time. I yawned a lot and I came to the conclusion that yawning was lifes most ultimate feeling and that it is the point of life. The movie I had seen played a big role in my thoughts. I started to get a weird sensation to scratch my butt and then to finger it but I was too tired too. I thought for a long time about the movie and the philosophy behind it and what really was the meaning of Life, The Universe and Everything. Finally around 3 or 4 I was so tired of being stoned that I fell asleep.

When I woke up around 7 I was no longer high but I felt like I had slept for days and I felt really relaxed and nice. One crazy and scary thing that happened was my left hand was numb and it was crooked and looked like a retards hand. It was also very wrinkly and looked like it was a little smaller than the right hand. Im not making this up! I became very afraid and went to the bathroom with my limp hand. I took my other hand I started to shake the other hand violently to get some blood in it. After a minute or two or this I got some feeling in it and it was no longer wrinkly. I then went back to my room but it happened again and I became very afraid that it was going to stay that way and that it was my punishment for doing Morning Glory seeds. I crossed my right hand with the left and tried to pop my finger nails for some reason and finally it became normal again. This never happened again and I hope it doesnt.

Overall the Morning Glory trip was pretty damn good and it was the most intense thing I have ever done. I cant really explain what all I was seeing or hearing or feeling but it was euphoric and everyone should try it once. I wouldn't do more than 6 grams and I'm glad I took away the chemicals because I did not feel sick or dizzy at all. I will probably do it again with my own seeds that Im growing so I wont have to do all that to it again.</bodytext></report>
