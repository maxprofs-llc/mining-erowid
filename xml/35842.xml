This happened about four months ago. One day I was at a local department store and happened to notice they had some flying saucer morning glory seeds. After seeing this I immediately pocketed ten or eleven packages due to the fact there seemed to be a fairly small amount in each pack. When I got home I counted out the seeds to find I had 450 seeds. I decided I had enough to have a smaller dose now and a larger dose later on to explore this substance further if need be. I then counted out the amount of seed I thought would be a moderately small dose, washed them in dish soap and water, rinsed them off and chewed the little fuckers up. The taste wasn't that bad but after three or so minutes of chewing I decided it was enough and chased it with some mountain dew. This was at around ten to five.

About a half-hour went by and all I was feeling was the jitters and a sour feeling building in my stomach. After fifteen more minutes I decided the sour feeling was getting unbearable and some pot seemed like the perfect solution. After rolling a dime bat to go smoke to relieve this pain I headed down towards a small creek down from my house to smoke it. While siting on a rock and smoking my joint I noticed how beautiful the way the water looked surrounded by all the trees and that it was amazing how close I live to nature. I think this is when I began tripping. When I got home I decided I should just lye down and watch some TV. After a half-hour of this following the story of whatever was on TV was too hard so I just closed my eyes and zoned out.

It started off with all these random thoughts and pictures running through my head which lead into all these thoughts and images getting more and more complex until deciphering the meaning of it all was impossible. I believe this is when shit really hit the fan.

I'm not quite sure what exactly happened here and putting it in words is next to impossible. The only way of describing what happened after I opened my eyes is I seen reality melt right before them. Im utterly perplexed as to why this amount of seeds effected me so much. What I was beginning to experience at this point in time was much stronger than all of my prior shroom trips combined. Nothing could prepare for what my mind was about to catapult me into.

First my ceiling began to look like solar systems foreign to any I've ever seen and they kept shifting, changing and morphing. It was like I was watching multiple universes being born and dying right before my eyes. Looking at my hands made my fingers spin and whirl about individually without pattern. Walls posters, my TV, my computer, my shelves seemed to be one big oil painting swirling, melting and shifting color producing utter mindfuck within my head. I could hear my parents company from my room and I began to listen desperately to try and hear what they were saying. The sounds of their voices were extremely muffled and I thought was hearing them say I was dead. After hearing this I grabbed my body in shock and I couldn't feel anything. It was as if my entire body was numb to the point of deadness. Right now I had a buzz on to kill a horse and I went totally sideways.

I first started to question who I am. In his state of mind this was not a wise decision. I couldn't even remember who I was. It was like I never knew what made me, me. This is where I first experienced total ego loss. I was more confused than I ever was in my life and I felt very disoriented. After watching patterns on my arms I thought for some reason I knew everything. Literally. I thought knew the answers to the deepest questions of the cosmos and in my own mind, I did. I wish I had written all these things down at the time because I think it would be interesting to see what exactly was running through my mind then. I then closed my eyes and was greeted by a whole new world. I can't describe what I seen but it was as I had left my body completely and had an eternity long vacation in a strange new place within the depths of my mind. Time was an inconceivable concept now; the very thought of such a thing existing was absurd. It sounds strange because it is but then this all made perfect sense. After a little more pondering into why not how but why things work I started my slow decline back to reality.

Eating was still to strange and surreal of a task to do so I got undressed and tried to go to bed. Tried is a key factor in the previous sentence. No matter how hard I tried sleep was unattainable. Realizing this I just laid there until the inevitable came. I had to sleep at sometime. Waking up the next day, shaken by the lucidity and weirdness of the dreams the night presented me with hours ago I slowly pieced what had happened together. I had forgot most of the things I was thinking and that I saw/heard but I had a newfound feeling of understanding of life in general.

In conclusion I would have to say this little seeds can be one powerful tool. I am very glad I wasn't in a social place after eating these seeds because the outcome would have been atrocious. I do wish I had a sitter, but I thought the night before was going to be a light trip that would show me the tip of the iceberg. As some advice I would caution people using this to lose their virginity to psychedelics to start small and have a sitter. Don't be a hero. This really bitch slapped me and it could have gotten pretty ugly if given different circumstances. All in all Im glad I tried this substance because it really opened my mind up to a completely foreign state of mind. I will be experimenting with these again.
