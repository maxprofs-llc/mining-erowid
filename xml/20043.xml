In early September, I traveled to nearby New Hope, PA.  I love that town and it was a very nice afternoon.  I bought a bunch of CD's and some herbs and so on.  I had heard about Salvia and read about its effect, so when I saw some on sale, I had to give it a shot.

The gentleman who sold it was very informative and was interested in what I thought about the experience.  He recomended I try some standard leaves first and then maybe some 7X.  Well, over the next few months I kept reading and just could not find the ideal time/place and mindset to try it, until yesterday.  Twas the day after christmas and I was alone and at peace for the first time in a few months... I am kind of a work-a-holic so I do not take a lot of time out for meditation, etc.

I had a glass of wine and packed the salvia into a bowl (about 1/2 of a gram or so of stadard strength dried leaf).  I had heard it could make me dizzy so I made sure I was next to my couch out in my sun porch.   I took a large hit from my freshly cleaned proto-pipe and held it for about 15 seconds.  That was all it took and I started to feel very different.  I took the second hit, put down the pipe slowly sat down as my head started to spin a bit.  Sudenly but not too suddenly, I felt a very nice feeling come over me.  It felt somehow familiar but I could not remember when I had felt it before.  I think I was very young, maybe 3 or 4 because memories started to flood into my head of a warm mild day with lots of sun walking with my mother in Philadelphia.  I felt very relaxed and removed from reality.  It was almost like dreaming but still being awake.  A memory from my early childhood eased into my head as I could hear some neighbors and children playing in the yards nearby.  I remembered a playground and a park where my mother used to bring me sometimes.  We were almost always the only ones there and it was very peaceful, away from the busy part of the city.

I became very aware of the sounds and felt almost as if everyone was in this journey together.  Life seemed so 'right' as if I were viewing/feeling it from a spectator's viewpoint.  Things just seemed to smile at me.  Wow! I heard myself say which kinda pulled me back to reality a bit.  This stuff was truly wonderful I thought. I looked out of the large windows of my sunroom and felt bathed in the light of the sun and the fresh smells of a mild winter day floated past.  I stood up to open the windows a bit and felt as if I were floating kind of slanted toward the windows instead of walking.  After I opened them I quickly decided to sit again and enjoy the moment in life that was unfolding before me.  OK I know that sounds very cosmic and New Age and all, but believe me, I am as 'rooted' as the next guy. But I could not help but become enchanted by this plant. I hope to have antoher chance soon to journey a bit deeper into this familiar but very different feeling.</bodytext></report>
