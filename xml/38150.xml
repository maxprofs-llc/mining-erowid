Have you ever heard of MDMA being used as treatment for Cerebral Palsy? I have mild spastic-ataxic hemiplegia; I was given a dose of MDMA in 2001 and gained about sixty percent control and mobility in my affected left side. I tried MDMA a couple of times again between 2001 and 2004, and I now have almost eighty-five percent muscle and nerve control.

Do you know of any people with cerebral palsy who have been positively affected -- permanently -- by MDMA?</bodytext></report>
