My friends and I have always been into cocaine so we are somewhat experienced users. One day they had informed me they had bought an ounce (a rack of coke). So we sold half of it and made enough money to just blow the rest. Looking at our bag I knew we were in for a long night. Doing line after line, insane amounts of coke, getting totally strung out and paranoid I started to fuck up on my lines, not cutting them up enough. So by about midnight my friends were gone after about 6 hours of blowing lines totally fucked up. So I'm sitting there playing video games with my brother when my head started to hurt and I felt like I needed to blow my nose. I little drip of blood came out of my nose and fell on my shirt I thought 'no big deal' so I went to blow my nose and I blood started to flow violently spraying on the mirror and the walls chunks of shit comming through my nostrils I thinking to myself I am going to die. My heart is beating a million miles per hour, my brother is freaking out. The flow became less violent and I went and sat down still an abnormal amount of blood comming through though so I just sat there blitzed off my ass thinking I was going to die of blood loss luckily I didn't but still it was the most frightening experience of my life.
