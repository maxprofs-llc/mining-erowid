I've used Tramadol recreationally for over six months. I can't help but compare it to Aldous Huxley's mythical 'Soma' in his novel, Brave New World. What it truly excels at, for me, however, is as a rapid-onset anti-depressant, a social condiment, or the catalyst to a memorable rainy day in which nothing really extraordinary happened at all.

Even at the highest doses, the main problems with real opiates in general don't rear their head. Sociableness instead of apathy, affection instead of smacked-out bliss, projects turn to gravy, thoughts and emotions flow freely, negative thoughts or emotions are relegated to the back-burner for a day.

Perhaps the most striking thing I've found is Tramadol cannot really be abused. If I take more than four 50mg tablets within a 24 hour period, I will simply experience flu-like nausea. Recreationally, I found Tramadol is ideally taken every 36 hours, and no higher than 150mg. I find 100mg to be fine, all around, as the mood-lift is ideal for working/social conditions. With this regime, withdrawal was avoided completely.

If taken repeatedly, say, every 15 hours, the law of diminishing returns sets in, as well as some of the side-effects, such as irritability and lethargy, when dosage is finally lowered. re-.

A friend took one 50mg tablet, and experienced heavy nausea and pressure in the back of his head.</bodytext></report>
