It tasted bitter.  Not as bitter as some ecstasy tablets Ive had in the past, a kind of similar taste though, less acidic though.

First alerts were a nice body feeling, remarkably similar to MDMA.  This was turned up a notch by touch or by stretching.

I experienced very minimal side effects.  There was some extra burping, no real stomach issues, a little bit of muscle weirdness (no eye wiggles or jaw clenching or anything).  There was also quite a powerful appetite suppression effect.

There was a definite increased appreciation of music, some minor visuals.  I was very awake.  Strangely, my mindset seemed practically sober, I never once forgot what I was talking about it mid-sentence or anything like that, very on-the-ball.  I may have been slightly more talkative and energetic than usual, but thats about it.

I enjoyed it, though it was not much of a psychedelic, mind expanding time, at 10mg anyways.  This seemed about as mind-blowing as a six of beer.  Id call it a feel good hallucinogen (hallucinogen in the most visual/non-mental sense of the word).  There was no really auditory or other senses affected, except maybe my sense of taste, it may have been slightly heightened.

I could have easily handled this in public, or even around my parents or friends, and they would have had no idea.

Although it was very enjoyable, it seemed to be almost a tease at this dosage.  I would love to see what 15 or 20mg is like.  On the Shulgin Scale Id rate this trip as a +1 for the most part, +2 around the peak time.

I did it at 4pm today.  I came down around 10pm.  I feel 100% sober.  I dont feel sketchy at all.  I am however, noticeably more tired than I usually am at this time of night, my leg muscles are a little sore, but I have done a lot of walking today.  The next day I was fine.</bodytext></report>
