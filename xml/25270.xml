You know how when you're younger in gradeschool and even through to college you are bombarded by anti-drug programs.  With little stuffed penguins telling you to 'B-Cool' and that drugs are bad.  C'mon you know who ever thought up a talking, sunglass-wearing penguin was doped up.  They introduce you to marijuana the 'gateway drug', evil cocaine and herion.  And at that point in your life you're thinking that drugs are the direct path to eternal damnation.

And if you're anything like me there also comes that point in your life where you're tempted by some drug or another and you just shrug your shoulders and say 'sure... I'm curious, why not?'

I've smoked pot for years now and it's like second nature to light up.  I've done e and a few pills.... tripped balls on shrooms.  But that about sums up my drug experience till the other night.  I've seen people do coke before and the thought of it just never appealed to me.

Well there was a line just waiting for me and other people talking about how great it was... I figured if there was ever a time to do it, might as well do it when it's free and laying there.

I know this sounds pretty horrible... but it felt like one of the best decisions of my life.  I snorted two lines and about a minute later I was in heaven.  This girl handed me the card that they used for the lines and told me to lick it.  What a taste.  I don't think I'll ever forget it.  Next thing I knew my mouth was numb and I was in heaven.

A few minutes later after getting every possible trace of the powder off the table I could someone lit up a blunt.  The feeling of smoking was totally different than anything I've ever experienced before.  It didn't feel as intense.

I drove this girl home while I was hyped up on it.  It was nice to be 'fucked up' but still have a clear head.  I think that was my favorite part about coke.  After I got back there was another line waiting for me.

 Coming down was insane.  I was feeling beat and just ....tired.  Everyone around keep saying they'd kill for some more coke.  Which disgusted me.  I hate seeing people's willpower go out the window like that.  I don't ever want to crave something like that.... to sound desperate like you're begging.  I went home that night.... went out the next night... got shit faced drunk and fucked the bumper of my truck up... met up w/ those ppl again and did more coke... another line and a half.  I've had three different types of coke over two days... stuff that had me going 'wow'.. stuff that had me going 'wtf' and stuff that burned the fuck out of my nose and throat.

But all in all... I'm not quite sure how I feel about coke.  I am disgusted at myself to think that I love it.  But deep down inside I know I do.  I'd love to have another line right about now... and I just had a little drip in my nose.  Sweet.
