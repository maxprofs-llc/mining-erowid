inhaled
/n

/n
/n

/n
/n
-hold on little one
/n
     lead me sally
/n
-that i will
/n
/n
the field of vision; dark
/n
twenty seconds..
/n
errupting color
/n
the emptyness, 
/n
sparkeles to life
/n
vibrant fucking life
/n
/n
tunnels; tunnels errupting everywhere
/n
intertwining vines;
/n
mirror images; 
/n
so many vines?
/n
so many patterns...
/n
they shoot back, back into infinity
/n
   these numbers know no bounderies...
/n
they hold no limits
/n
that i see; which i have sought
/n
   there the bending tree
/n
times; howmany times?  it etched backwards
/n
this bending tree; 
/n
fire; ablaze in glory
/n
greens; strange hues; strange sensations...
/n
/n
voices all around; whispers of here and there
/n
discussing the anywho's
/n
the what nots of life
/n
/n
patterns; decending upon me
/n
at terriable speed and unstopable furry
/n
 the end of the tunnel
/n
    breakthrough..
/n
/n
hyperspace.
/n
/n
   ITS BREEDING?!
/n
HOLY JESUS im feeding it 
/n
     no use stopping
/n
   no one can stop it
/n
/n
'you cant stop me you cant stop me you cant stop me'
/n
I dont want to
/n
'follow me follow me follow me'
/n
        down the winding winding path
/n
/n
what is this that i see?
/n
strange reality; 
/n
purple; colors; entities have come
/n
I float through a field 
/n
strange vibes
/n
strange glows
/n
time; its as existant as a one dimentional object
/n
/n
ahah ; there we  have it; two sides of the circle; a floating syphony of elves 
/n
and throbbing orbs
/n
/n
still I ascend to heights
/n
I had no intention of reaching
/n
an all to familiar sensation..
/n
splicing
/n
/n
my feet; miles away
/n
me torso; segmented beyond belief
/n
cakleling laughter: YOU CANT STOP IT
/n
  no; your right; I cant stop it
/n
I merely hold on
/n
this hurricane of exotic chemicals
/n
unleashed upon my head;
/n
/n
how long has it been?
/n
that concept has merely faded
/n
/n
then the true contacct was made;
/n
the one that i was ment to see
/n
the thing i was ment to behold
/n
I had come
/n
the pullsing edge of DMT hyperspace
/n
so near; the vaulting speed of lady ska
/n
so strong.
/n
pushing; pushing
/n
if i was already in hyperspace?
/n
where was this place i was going to?
/n
/n
memory fades...
/n
there is no level
/n
no single analogy
/n
that will ever mark; that will ever come close to
/n
retelling this lizard Kingdome
/n
this Kingdome come; 
/n
this realm of two worlds
/n
/n
fabric; the fabric tears
/n
sickening shudders
/n
violent shakes
/n
tunnels; i continue down more and more
/n
elves; fucking elves
/n
they cant keep their fucking pants on
/n
erotic fucks...
/n
   I love it
/n
/n
merging with space
/n
no refriderators...
/n
this is 
/n
far more...
/n
galactic proportions
/n
cosmic visions
/n
/n
before me stands a temple
/n
infinitely high
/n
infinitely large
/n
climbing up it
/n
lizards; of varying color
/n
I travel around it; warping
/n
pulsating beats
/n
are those drums I hear?
/n
/n
   BOOMSHAKLAKA MOTHERFUCKER NO TURNING BACK
/n
conversations
/n
misty conversations; sweep upon me; sweet familiarity
/n
fearful alieniess
/n
is that a word?
/n
what is a word?
/n
logos?
/n
what are those?
/n
Christ; spinning and spinning
/n
/n
colors.
/n
/n
vibrant colors
/n
/n
odd de ja vu
/n
familiarity
/n
I am meeting an old friend; how about some tea?
/n
no tea tonight
/n
no rest for those who test the limits
/n
what are the limits?
/n
the end; ahaha; no concept of an end
/n
circling this ancient structure
/n
I am content on 
/n
simply completing my orbit; round
/n
and round the merrygoround
/n
then we all fall down.
/n
down?
/n
/n
viscious speed
/n
/n
decending into the structure
/n
throbbing masses
/n
entangled patterns
/n
I see Mayan symbols
/n
cosmically huge patterns
/n
they rotate
/n
to my left a smelve (smelve?  aha; he is built of DMT likes; ska personality; freindly; benignly watching me)
/n
he points
/n
I look
/n
the patterns before my field of vision
/n
 begin to extend backwards
/n
and backwards
/n
mirror images
/n
then a kaleidoscope of colors
/n
rotating inwards
/n
jumping glee
/n
euphoria.
/n
/n
then it turns.
/n
jesus fuck; how long has it been?!
/n
lady ska departs; slowly; notcibly
/n
familiar DMT patterns
/n
familiar DMT entities
/n
a purple room; I stare through tinted glass
/n
inside are desks with knobs
/n
and things i dont remember
/n
mirror images extend backwards....
/n
/n
how long has it been!?!?!?!??!!?
/n
/n
blackout
/n
/n
why do we throw it all away?
/n
/n
Conclusion:
/n
I blacked out after 10 minutes according to my sitter.
/n
The Salvia never left; the point where I begin to feel as though its presence is leaving is marked by the arrival of a Level Six in combination with a truly magnificent dosage of DMT.  I simply forgot I was on drugs.  Therefore I merged with the high and accepted it as my eternal state of mind.
/n
/n
This trip did not teach me anything; it did not open up any new insights into life.  What it did was take my mind so far past the limits to places never before imagined.  This was a psychic journey in a literal sense.  I wasn't out to find any answers; I was merely an explorer.  And that is exactly what I did.
/n
/n
Unimaginably intense.
/n
/n
The trip itself rivaled that of le Belladonna.</bodytext></report>
