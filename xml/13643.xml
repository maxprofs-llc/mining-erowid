Let me start off by explaining that I am one of those very rare people that reacts very badly to THC, there is no such thing as a good weed high for me, paranoia doesn't describe what weed does to me, I think paranoia is when I become convinced someone in the room is a narc and cops are coming to bust me any second(typical weed paranoid story from friends).

What happens to me on weed is on a whole other level, more like delusional psychosis. I become convinced that every word from any person/tv show has some kind of horrific double meaning that I cannot figure out, that everything that has ever happened to me had some hidden agenda that I can only see while high on weed. Nothing can bring me back to reality accept facing the wall and sleeping it off. Someone talking in a voice too quiet for me to hear AUTOMATICALLY means they are ploting something against me, I have horrific 'realizations' about the nature of existance itself.

Its very very bad and I never ever smoke weed anymore because of it.

I always assumed this was because of the 'mild' disassociative effects of weed, I decided to test this theory by taking mushrooms the first day of my semester spring break. I got 60$ worth, I asked my roommate(who knows all about my weed reaction) that if I start to really freak out would he please turn everything off and go to sleep and I will take some sleeping pills and sleep it off. He agrees.

I divide the bag in half and grind the mushrooms up, I then wash it down with orange juice and take a chewable 500mg vitamin C tab. All on an empty stomach.

My source tells me that is enough to where I will be convinced the people in the posters on my wall are talking to me.

My friend downs the 2nd half of the shrooms, I play computer games and wait VERY nervous that any second now I am going to freak out and wake up the next day in a mental institution in a straight jacket.

After about 30 minutes I start to feel a little 'off' like I have had 2 or 3 beers, not quite messed up but not 100% normal. My heart is beating very fast, not due to the shrooms I think but just because I am so scared.

After an hour or so I am really feeling it, colors look much brighter and I feel euphoric, very nice, I start to calm down, I put on some dance music mp3s and use a 3d vis plugin for my mp3 player. The colors swirl together like on weed but much more strongly and I have no bad paranoia clouding the experience and brining me down. I go out to smoke with my roommate, the hallway looks really long and the floor is moving up in down like waves.

None of this wierds me out at all, it just makes me laugh. The cig smoke looks very trippy, we stare at trees for a while and they look very very cool, I am still not wierded out, and I fine if I really concentrate on something all the effects go away, I feel totally sober. Then I relax and watch more mp3 vis and I am having a blast.
/n
/n
At this point I am very euphoric, I become talkative and extremely energetic, I have tracers in my vision, no negative thoughts in my head, nothing can touch me. 
/n

I decide to put on a cheesy movie for a while, we put on Teenage Mutuant Ninja Turtles the live action movie. I cannot stop laughing at how stupid it is, I laugh so hard I make no noise and have to lean forward on my desk, I am having a blast. I love this feeling.

I spend the rest of the night running around campus and being very open and friendly, and drinking orange juice like their is no tommorow, I spent 15$ on orange juice that night alone.

The sun finally comes up and I walk outside to have a last smoke, the hallway is bathed in yellow light and it looks so beautiful, I am at peice, I feel great, finally a drug I can do and not freak.
/n
/n
After my smoke I decide to see if I can force a bad trip somehow, I put on a really violent horror movie and listen to death metal mp3s, I still feel fine just slightly less euphoric due to the more serious subject matter.
/n
/n
All in all it was great, I had a lot of fun, and did mushrooms every night that week. I had no hangover the next days after that, just a slight euphoric feeling still.
/n
/n
I love shrooms and plan on doing them whenever possible.

Oh yeah BTW, the ONLY negative side effect is that I felt really dirty when the shrooms hit, I had taken a shower 6 hours before my trip but I could feel the oil on my hands and it grossed me out, I took a shower and changed into all clean clothes and felt way better.</bodytext></report>
