I was out with three of my friends looking for acid, and unfortunately, we couldn't find any.  So we called up our friendly pill (ecstasy) dealer and we didnt have enough money for any pills, but he said he had glass and that two people could split a 20bag.  We went and got two bags and split them up between the four of us.  We bumped up at about 1 am.  The burn in my nose was worse than snorting anything else.  It went away after about a minute and my sinuses immediately cleared completely.  I expected an immediate rush but instead just felt a little something, like a slight tingle, sort of like an oncoming roll.  I then went out to smoke a cigarette with my friends and I was taking huge hits of it because it felt so good.  I was talking extremely fast and words just rolled off my tongue with ease.  It was already fabulous.

Another friend of mine, P, was having a party so we all went to his house.  The whole car ride going there and about the first hour I was there we had to pretend we were sober because we were with our friend, J, who is a speedfreak and would be upset that we didn't share.  I felt it very easy to control in this respect.  After a while we had to tell him because he was confused as to why we were all acting speedy.  But anyway, back to how it feels.  At about 3 am I started peaking, a peak that lasted nearly 4 hours.

I felt invincible, like nothing could ever bring me down.  My eyes were open wider than they had ever been, with pupils slightly dilated.  At this point it was hard to walk or talk or do anything more than just feel, and be.  I was chain smoking and chewing my lips and cheeks uncontrollably.  My head felt so extrememly happy, just like how it feels on ecstasy.  My body felt like it feels when I'm tripping, except for me hands which were all tingly like I had done a couple hits of nitrous.  I smoked a little marijuana, only 2 hits, and suprisingly it just sinergized and made me feel even more speedy.  I looked in the mirror and saw myself as gorgeous.  My mind was racing.  I was breathing extremely heavily and strangely.  This is the best peak I've ever felt from any drug, it was almost too much to take, and I felt like I could never come down.

After 4 hours of this wonderful, wonderful feeling, I stopped feeling like I was coming up and up.  I just felt happy and energized.  We got back from the party at about 7 am and went to my friend A's house.  Two people with us weren't on meth and they fell asleep.  Sleep was so far from my mind.  I just lied on a couch til about 10 am, closing my eyes and thinking.  At 12 I went and got A and her boyfriend who also hadn't slept or come down.  They drove me home where I proceeded to talk to my mom very happily, which rarely happens.  At around 4 pm my friends came and got me again and we went into the city.  A and her boyfriend had crashed really hard, but this never happened to me.  I just sort of came back to sobriety, and stayed happy the whole day, until 8 pm when I could barely stay awake and fell into a deep sleep.

One note about meth: It really messes with my memory.  The next day I could remember everything that happened, but something was missing and it was all sort of fuzzy.  After about a week I could finally remember everything that everyone said and such, which is how my memory usually works.

Ever since this day I have yearned so badly for that feeling again.  It was the absolute best and I'm convinced nothing could ever take me higher.  In reflection, I think I did a really large amount, because as I was peaking I kept thinking I was about to die, and that probably wasn't far from the truth.  Meth is addictive, really addictive.  Everyday for about three months after this, it was basically the only thing I could think about.  If I didn't have good friends urging me not to do it again, I would probably have a serious drug problem now.  I haven't done it in the 5 months or so since this experience, yet I don't think there is any way I could ever say no if I saw a line on a table offered to me, but I'm not going out and looking for it all the time either.  If you want a great high and have strong willpower to not get addicted, I would strongly recommend doing meth.  There are things in my life I regret (drinking to excess, smoking pot) and this is definitely not one of them.</bodytext></report>
