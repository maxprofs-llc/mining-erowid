I begin to lose contact
/n
From my so familiar scene
/n
Objects begin to become real
/n
'Could this be only a dream?'
/n
/n
Clouds are moving around me
/n
Familiar faces are peeking
/n
But in the void lies the noble truth
/n
In which we are seeking.
/n
/n
But once more I ask myself, 
/n
'Could this be only a dream?'
/n
/n
There was no warning
/n
No call considered fair
/n
I must magnify my vision
/n
And remove myself from care.
/n
/n
And in these moments
/n
So amazingly beautiful
/n
We are at peace with the Universe
/n
Ambitious and in control.
/n
/n
But once more I ask myself,
/n
'Could this be only a dream?'
/n
/n
As the void is obtained
/n
and the noble truth in hand
/n
I shed a tear in fear
/n
This won't happen again.
/n
But I am very certain
/n
There's a journey see
/n
But once more I ask myself,
/n
'Could this be only a dream?'</bodytext></report>
