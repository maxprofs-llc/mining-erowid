As I drove home with a pounding headache due to the suckfest of a comedown from repeated doses of MDPV, millions of different thoughts flew through my mind about how I was going to write this report, because this is definitely one of the most interesting experiences I've ever had.
/n
/n
Well, first off, I'd like to tell you that I was very, very, very irresponsible with this drug. I only read one thing about bath salts before I tried this, and the short description I had it wasn't even the same brand that I had bought, so it could have contained an entirely different substance than TranQuilty (and, yes, that is spelled correctly, for some reason it had the same logo as the tranquility bath salts, but my package omitted the final 'i')
/n
/n
Well, the substance I read about said to take 25mg, and that you can redose, but it isn't advised to do so. Oh, God, I should've came to [website], it would have saved me a horrible stomach ache, as well as the annoying headache I am dealing with right now, probly about 10-12 hours after my final redose.
/n
/n
I was trying to be cautious, but it turns out my caution was pointless because it was an ignorant caution. I eyeballed about a 10mg line. However, I don't have much experience with powder, so this could have been totally off (STUPID). As soon as I snorted that little tiny line (it was more like a bump than a line), I felt pretty nice. It was almost like I chugged a cup of coffee or two, except I didn't have to shit like crazy and I didn't have any stomach pain. Well, my brain is really good at playing tricks on me, and when I noticed the floor seemed to have kind of a fluid motion, and this normally happens during my come-up on e, so I just credited placebo for that, and I still think that it was just placebo at that point, because this was happening no more than a minute after I had snorted.
/n

Drip tasted pretty nasty after a few minutes, it kind of reminded me of molly, but it didn't burn while going up, so it was still different. Well, when the drip started happening I could tell I was concentrating more...I was pretty disappointed, because normally I go ADD crazy on e, and, because of the descriptive feelings of the report I had read before this, that is what I was expecting. I felt like I did some addy.
/n
/n
Well, even though I wanted to have an MDMA like experience, I did enjoy addy as well, so I decided to do another line of equal size. Well, that was pretty cool...I felt awesome after that, after the drip my throat was irritated a tiny bit, but I was having a really good time, watching the news as I found out Osama Bin Laden had been captured, I was EXTREMELY interested and oddly patriotic feeling, normally I would care less. After the prez gave his speech my friend and I went downstairs to play video games. The game was moving so fast that while I enjoyed it and it made me laugh it did irritate me a little bit...well my friend had to go to the bathroom about 3 hrs after the first dose and while he was up there I poured out another line because I thought it would be more fun even though I wasn't coming down yet, it wasn't like a compulsive need to do more and more, but I just wanted the effects to intensify...this line was bigger, in accordance to the other lines it was probly like 25mg (which I later found that this was a horrible thing to do, don't increase your dose! If you repeat, make sure you go smaller)
/n
/n
This line burned soooo bad. The drip came on immediately, and it lasted a few minutes and it burned and tears were involuntarily streaming just from the burn. That ended in a couple minutes, and, as soon as it did, my throat hurt, but I couldn't have cared less I was having such a freakin good time. I texted people like crazy and my friend fell asleep (he didn't do any) and I went on facebook, and talked on the chat for like two more hours just having fun. I couldn't pull myself away from my keyboard, and I couldn't do anything other than type. I started to come down at that point, and it pretty much completely ended. I was still energetic, i didn't have any jitters, but my mouth was pretty dry despite the three bottles of water I drank during this time, and I noticed my throat hurt a little more. I didn't care. I was still happy, but the drug had pretty much completely worn off, and I had no real horribly negative effects at this point. I was in love with this drug at this time in the night (4am)
/n
/n
Well...that's when I hopped online. I found so many people had only taken like 5-10mg and felt horrible... and I was like wtf, why is it that everyone that has tried this drug seem like they are kinda a pussy... well, I understand why now. I went into the back room in my friend's basement to smoke. I came out feeling horrible. This is the first bad experience I've EVER had with weed...it made no sense, because weed normally makes comedowns better, not worse, and the fact that this comedown wasn't bad at all in the first place puzzled me. As I felt my stomach start to hurt I kept telling my friend 'I wish I hadn't smoked, I wish I hadn't smoked =[' but it really wasn't that bad, just uncomfortable and annoying.
/n

Here is where it got bad. I thought (in my stupid state of mind after mixing these things that should not have been mixed) I thought maybe doing more would counteract the feeling that the weed gave me. I did a small bump, maybe 5-10mg, it was smaller than the 25 by a lot, that's for sure. I didn't feel anything. No drip, no burn, nothing. For some reason, even though I had read it takes a half hour to kick in, I did another bump about five minutes after. I still felt nothing, and then I felt really friggin amazing after about 15 minutes. That lasted about 5 minutes, and then the dull ache in my stomach grew and grew and grew until it felt like it was burning. It was 7AM at this point, with no hope of sleep in sight. I just felt horrible, and I knew I had fucked myself.
/n
/n
Well, negativity didn't help. I came back online and went straight to the trip disasters section, and pretty much fed my paranoia. I felt good and horrible at the same time, it was the strangest feeling ever. But, I wanted it to end. I'm soooo tired of typing right now, btw lol. 
/n
/n
Well, I read jerking off helps on come downs, so I tried that. It felt good, and it subtracted from the concentration on my stomach pain while I was doing it, but as soon as it ended, I still felt pretty sick, although it helped. It was almost 9AM at this point, Most of the time in the night I had spent reading intensely, and I noted that this would help as a study aid if I used it more responsibly.
/n

I took some benadryl to help me sleep after this, and I guess it sort of worked, even though I felt horrible as I was sleeping, and it was not a very good rest...my friend walked into the room like 3 hours later...I looked up at him and I was like dude I just went to sleep haha, I feel so badddd, while at the same time noting in my head that I did feel better, but my stomach was still annoyed and my head began to hurt. Well, he informed me it was almost noon... 0.o
/n
/n
I thought I went to bed like five minutes before he walked in the room, and I was really surprised, and I knew why my stomach felt a little better now. Anyways, I was still really energetic, and I hopped in the shower, but that didn't really help much. I ate some much needed food to soak up some of the acid in my stomach, and it didn't go down well. It was just hard to eat. However, I didn't throw up. After I ate I tried sleeping on the couch for a few minutes, and I slept a little better this time, but only for an hour. I woke up and decided to go home, and I was just annoyed that I wasn't there in the first place. I was driving and I decided to get some fast food, along with a smoothie. The smoothie for the cold and the greasy food to absorb whatever stuff was left in my stomach.
/n
/n
The burger and fries went down surprisingly easy, and that was right before I started writing this, and the smoothie tasted pretty good, too. My stomach feels much better, but my head still hurts and is not getting much better, and I feel like taking a 3mg bump might help, but I don't want to risk having the stomach pain, the head pain is much more tolerable.
/n

In retrospective of this experience, I'd say it was neutral. If I had been more responsible, it probly would have been an entirely positive experience (it was until I mixed it with weed). I find it sad as well as extremely dangerous that they have to advertise this product as bath salts, because there is no dosage information available to the user, and an inexperienced person (like myself) could have done the entire 500 mg bag in one line...and this could possibly be fatal.
/n
/n
But, I am willing to try this again another day, in a more controlled and educated manner. And, my total dosages probly ended up being around 100mg, although it could have been more...and this was bad in the paranoia part for me, because I had not found any reports of anybody taking as much as I had taken, so I freaked out for a couple minutes, but I kept my cool...so if you have a similar experience, do not worry, and try to relax (as impossible as that may seem, lol)

Finally, be responsible. Nobody likes bad experiences, and they can be prevented if you are smart and take the time to learn about this drug before you go sniffing away like I did.</bodytext></report>
