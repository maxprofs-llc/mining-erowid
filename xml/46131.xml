I'm going to keep it short. My grandmother was luckily able to get from one of my dealers a 750ml bottle with cannabis stems and leaves and rubbing alchohol. I also saw some garlic in the bottle.

Well, my grandmother for as long as I can remember has been complaining about pain in her knees. Every time she would get up and walk you could feel her pain because she would let you know. The first day we got that bottle, I applied it all around her knees, both front and back, and in fifteen minutes we were walking around the block with great relief. She says there's still a little pain in the knees, but it relieves all muscular pain and most of the knee's pain.</bodytext></report>
