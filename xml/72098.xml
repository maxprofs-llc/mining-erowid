I had read a little bit here and there about the effects of DHEA on testosterone production.  I am 28 years old and I just didn't feel right about my libido.  I'd had my testosterone tested and it was 300.  Normal values for men my age are 300-1000.  So, I felt that I needed a boost.  After about 3 days of taking 25 mg with my lunch, I have noticed MARKED improvement!  I have slightly more energy, I sleep better, and for me more importantly, I have began having things happen that only happened when I was younger.  I've noticed a much improved libido and almost as if the DHEA has awakened my sexual senses again.  I had a few slight headaches but they went away without much fight.  I have also had a little increase in acne but overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking to re-vitalize themselves sexually and in general.</bodytext></report>
