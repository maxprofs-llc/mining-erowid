I made a cold water extraction of syrian rue by grinding up the seeds in a coffee grinder and then placing all the powder and seed shells in a coffee filter.  I then took the coffee filter and twisted and tied it shut.  I placed the filter in a small glass mason jar and put in 1 cup of distilled water and 1.5 teaspoons of white vinegar.  I shook it for  a few moments and placed it in the fridge over night.   Then I took the mimosa hostilis root bark and shredded it in my coffee grinder and placed it in a large steel pot with 2 liters of distilled water, and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.  I brewed this on a very light simmer (very few bubbles, but agitated water)until the water was reduced to about 2 cups. I poured this out into a steel bowl and through a t-shirt filter. I recollected the root bark form the t-shirt and put it back in the pot and repeated with another run of 2 liters of water and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.  Brewed it down, poured it into my collecting pot through the t-shirt and did the process one more time.  Finally, after three brewings, I took the collecting pot and put its contents back into the brewing pot, but first I removed the rootbark and put it into a seperate container.  I added about 3 liters of water to the pot and turned the burner on high.  I boiled the three brewings all the way down to about 2 cups of liquid and added another liter of water and boiled it down again.  This boiling process is to remove the vinegar.  After I had 1.5 cups of liquid I poured this contents into a small jar and placed in my fridge overnight.

The next morning I took both jars out and heated them up slightly.  I drank the syrian rue down first in a slow method that took about 15mins.  I waited until I was slightly high and feeling the rue (about 20mins) and then I began to drink the mimosa brew.  I sipped the mimosa brew slowly for about 30 mins, and also sipped some fresh ginger tea that I had made by chopping up ginger and boiling it.

Approx. an hour after finishing my brew I was treated to a wonderful and dazzling light show much akin to a strong mushroom/acid trip, however this was much more powerful.  In fact it was so physical that I began to get really hot so I decided to leave the little meditation mat that I had made for this dream.   I went outside and it was a gorgeous San Francisco bay area evening.  Not too cold, but invigorating with a quiet breeze, and a slight misting rain.  I sat underneath an eve so that my head and upper body remained dry and my legs were being misted on.  The setting was pretty phenomenal.

The visuals picked up to a very high degree acid trip, but instead of being just visual it was also very physical.  I could feel the colors as they twisted and rotated and created new patterns.  It was a very intense feeling.  This went on for about 20 mins or so.  The patterns got very powerful so I decided to test out the closed eye visuals.  How remarkable! The light was brilliant to say the least.  It was like my own personal Pink Floyd Laser light show! and I had front row seats............the intensity in my head picked up and then out of no where came the purge.

There are many things to say of the purge, but to keep it brief It was sudden and very strong.  I was sitting there enjoying a nice closed eye visual journey and decided to lay down.  I guess this twisting envoked the purge because not too seconds after I moved I had my bowl in hand and was releasing.  It was quite the feeling to be purging and to have the intense closed eye visual and physical stimulation that I was having.  There were all sorts of brilliant colors and many buddha/buddhist symbols.  If I were more religious, I would relate the pruging to a very religious experience.  But for now I will say that it was enjoyable in many different levels.  After the purging my light shows, and dreams were incredibly reduced.  I would say I had some slight dreams for the next half hour or so and then it was back to a very moderate mushroom trip.  That remained for another thirty or so minutes and then I was pretty much back to a normal state.

All in all, this was a pretty awesome experience and I do plan on doing it again.

Some things I will alter in my recipe:
/n
I will reduce the quantities of my mimosa down considerably.  I had about 1.5 cups of tea to drink.  And while this was not the most difficult thing to palette, I believe it made for a longer absorption rate for my body.  SO by the time I had purged about an hour after consumption there was still a considerable amount of brew in my belly.   Also, I think I am going to get the mimosa from a more reputable source that is known to be stronger.  and finally I think I am going to do a cold water brewing on it.
