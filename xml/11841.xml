I began the testing by timing the amount of vodka I was about to consume.  I drank approximiately 3/4 the bottle of expensive vodka, mixed with fresh squeezed orange juice.

I was with my girlfriend, but she was sober and just observing me, making sure I didn't over do it.  Well, I drank for about 3 hours. felt pretty loaded.  then I popped 6, 10mg tabs of Valium to cap off the night.  I felt the effects of the valium 15 to 20 minutes after administering them orally.  At first, it was the usual dry mouth, slurred speech and clumsiness.  All this occured indoors, I was sitting in my den, looking at a picture of a bear.  I began feeling very sleepy, due to the valium.  Everything seemed slower, my stereo was on, but the noise somehow bothered me.

I decided to call it a night.  Once I got up from my chair, I immediately stumbled backwards and landed on my butt, and banged my head.  My girlfriend came in and looked at me.  I quickly stood up and realized I had lost all sense of balance. (Severe ataxia)  my mouth was dry, but somehow I managed to walk up my stairs, and slowly crawl into bed.  I put my headphones on and timed myself to see how long I could stay awake.  I was unconsciounse in about 30 seconds.  My girlfriend took the data.   the most severe effect of the Valium was probably the total loss of balance.

I awoke 3 hours later to urinate.  I got up from bed, and again fell on the stereo, my girlfriend woke up and helped me up,  as soon as she let go, I fell on my desk.  Well, the next morning i did not have a hangover.  But, wow, 60mg of Valium will sure make me lose your balance. it's scary, but insightful.</bodytext></report>
