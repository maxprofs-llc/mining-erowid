Setting: Beautiful day, with my friend B, who has already posted his report online.
/n
/n
Set: I am a psychonaut, I have experimented with Ayahuasca, shrooms, salvia, LSD, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-I, DiPT, MET, 4-HO-MET, MXE, MDMA, MDMC, to name a few. I have never experimented with 25I, but had been extremely curious about this compound for months. I basically read every report I could find on the internet. After having multiple dreams about it, I finally decided to try 25I.

0:00  Put blotter under tongue, or between gums. Held saliva in mouth as long as possible.
/n
/n
0:45  Started to feel a little anxiety. Me and B swallow our spit and look at each other, and say at the same time: Yup its starting

We decide to get our stuff together, and go walk in the park.

1:00  2:00  Felt nausea.  Felt uncomfortable. Felt chills.  I was off baseline. It felt like the beginning of an acid trip, but I was concerned I didn't take a high enough dose, or that the blotter didn't actually contain 750 ug, because I didn't really feel that much of an effect. +

2:00  3:00  The character of this compound finally began to develop, and the nausea diminished. I felt great, it was not overpowering at all! I lay down, staring at the sky. 'The world looks beautiful.' I noticed strong tracers: if a bug flew past, I would see a trail behind it. Walking around, the world looked normal. However, if I stopped to stare at something, it would morph and warp. Sometimes, I felt like I was looking at the world through a cloudy glass, it looked like a painting. I thought there was water in my eyes or something, because the world looked a little blurry, but that effect went away.  We also began to see auras around people. The experience came in waves, and was almost entirely visual. ++

3:00-4:00  We walk back into the house, and I want to say that I was disappointed at how mild the trip was, but what comes out of my mouth instead was: Holy fucking shit. We really began to trip, HARD, within a few minutes of walking back inside my house. I thought I was in fun house, everything looked really tiny, and huge, simultaneously. This drug was definitely messing with depth perception, but more-so than I had never experienced before. For example, while looking at my cell phone, it might grow large, then shrink, and the square looking apps on the screen would grow large and shrink also, but at different rates from one another on the screen. It was as if all of the underlying perceptual mechanisms responsible for simple object formation were out of synch.

Time would also speed up, then slow down. Everything was warped. When I closed my eyes, my vision was engulfed with fractals. Beautiful, intricate fractals, that I could even control and turn into incredible images. With my eyes open, I saw rainbows and fractals everywhere. However, I could easily tell that none of it was real. This drug is mostly visual, and I did not have any trouble speaking whatsoever. +++

4:00-5:00  The experience comes in waves. Long, drawn out waves, alternating between a ++/+++. I specifically remember seeing the RGB color spectrum coming out of light sources, and the colors were all in order. They would rotate; it was as if I was witnessing the color processing of the visual cortex. There were periods of introspection and uncomfortably. +++/++

5:00-9:00  The effects slowly tapered off until I hit baseline.

25I is probably the most stereotypical/recreational psychedelic drug I have ever used, and Ive used quite a few psychedelics. 25I makes me feel good, I have insane visuals, and it doesnt disrupt with my language abilities (that much). It is almost nothing like 2C-I. Just because it has a 16x greater potency for the 5-HT2a receptor DOES NOT mean that this compound is just a 16x more potent version of 2C-I. In my opinion, 25I was more comparable to LSD/shrooms, than any phenethylamine I have used. However, despite its high recreational value, I do not consider this drug profound on the level of shrooms, Ayahuasca, or salvia.

Conclusion:

/n
There was  little to no hangover to speak of, just an afterglow that lasted less than 24h. Excluding the come-up, it had extremely few negative mental side effects, but I will list the ones I experienced: heat rushes through my chest, increased heart rate during the come-up, felt chills, during the peak, I felt overheated, and my face and skin became slightly red. With that being said, it did not feel dangerous; and there were far less side effects for me when compared to other psychedelics. I would be very cautious about using this at a dance party, or rave, because of the over-heating issue. With that being said, I prefer 25I over every synthetic psychedelic I've tried to date, not including MDMA and MDMC. I give the experience a cautious thumbs up, but more testing needs to be done to determine it's safety.</bodytext></report>
