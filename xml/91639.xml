This is a short experience report on Modafinil taken from the prospective of someone who suffers with chronic anxiety.

I started suffering with tiredness and lethargy and was looking for something to aid mental focus. I knew Modafinil was a stimulant type drug but I wasn't quite prepared for just how stimulating.

I took 100mg in the morning after a light breakfast. The only other substance I took was caffeine from tea (very strong tea I might add).

within about 30-40 minutes I felt the effects of it which built up gradually and lasted over 10 hours. I felt very agitated and jittery, just as though I had drunk too much caffeine (I can normally only tolerate one cup of tea). I was very on edge all morning, the slightest noise would make me jump.

I was able to do work and found I could focus better, but the physical effects and anxiety was quite unpleasant for me. By physical effects, I mean body tension and extra stress. I felt a tightness in my chest, pains in my neck and shoulders. It was almost like border-line anxiety attack. My mood was also negatively affected. I felt slightly bad tempered and easily angered by things.

In short, although the drug did help my concentration and productivity, I wouldn't recommend it all for anyone suffers with anxiety or stress. It's just not worth it and may make the symptoms worse.</bodytext></report>
