In a quick summary: I experienced a 14+ hour intense trip on Foxy that was emotionally difficult for the first 5-6 hours and then calmed down and became enjoyable. I experienced  intense visual  and auditory stimulation and psychedelic induced introspection (akin to an LSD trip) examining difficult things in my life.  However, when the effects chilled out and the sun came up, I began to understand what had happened, calmed down and had an amazing time.  What started out as somewhat of a bad trip ended as an important, insightful, intense, and amazing experience.

Also significant is that I regularly take anti-depressants. I take 1 20mg pill of prozac every other day (basically the same as taking 10mg/day). This is a pretty low dose of prozac, and I have been on it for two years.    I don't take MDMA anymore because it doesn't work when on SSRIs like prozac (and I also don't can't afford to do drugs that increase my depressive, tendancies which MDMA does).  I wondered if foxy would react the same, and what would be the after-effects.  But my trip appeared to not be diminished in any way, and two days later as I type this, I don't feel the same 'depression' and emotional isolation I do after taking E or cocaine.

I had a friend who had tried 'Foxy' before, and it sounded interesting to me.  I've enjoyed many experiences with MDMA, acid, and mushrooms, and wanted to try something new.  I read up (although probably not enough) on the dosages and effects. I expected the experience to be somewhat of a cross between mushrooms and MDMA, with the MDMA component being stronger.  I did not realize in advance the potent psychedelic properties of 'Foxy' and hadn't mentally prepared for a 14+ hour trip.

Having done psychedelics, I know the importance of being in the right 'head' space.  Since I expected this trip to be more 'ecstasy-like' in quality, I wasn't worried about being in somewhat of a crappy mood.

My boyfriend and I went to a party that really started to annoy me. I had just received the foxy and wanted to try it out that night after the party (I'm just not a patient person).  Because I thought it would be more of an easy trip, it didn't matter to me that I was experiencing anxiety left over from a difficult work day that friday.  My boyfriend and I were bickering a little bit as well. I convinced him to leave the party around 11 pm because I wanted to try this and be able to get some sleep before I had to get up the next day to help a friend move.

We both had been drinking at the party. I was 'buzzed' but not seriously drunk, having had ~3beers.  He was much more drunk than I. We returned to his house, which is a very pleasant place. Lots of nice artwork, a good stereo, a nice kitchen, and a garden--very peaceful.  Since we didn't have a scale accurate to 1mg, we used a scale that was 'off' a bit, which probably was a bad idea. We tried to measure about 10 mg, but being a bit drunk, we said what the hell, and I think we ingested closer to about 16mg around 11:30 p.m.

It kicked in about 30 minutes later and came on fairly strong. I immediately experienced visuals and a confusing effect. Two friends came over to visit, and I was starting to feel silly and incapable of communicating--much like the beginning of a mushroom trip for me.  My stomach *was not* upset, although I hadn't eaten a lot for about 3 hours beforehand.  The visual stimulation came on VERY quickly; I noticed the table cloth 'breathing' and the textures and colors begin to move and sway.  The two friends who came over noticed I had been staring at the table cloth for a long time, and that's when I realized I had started tripping. This was approximately 45 minutes from ingestion (~12:15).

The two friends left and the next 4-5 hours were blurry and somewhat traumatic. I kept waiting for the 'happy' E feeling to kick in, and it never did.  My boyfriend and I couldn't communicate at all which caused me more anxiety because he seemed FAR off, and I couldn't figure out where he was emotionally.  We went to the bedroom and started having sex.  My predominant memory from this was that when i touched him I physically felt far away.  His body felt like play dough--like I wasn't feeling all physical input. We both felt like we had cotton mouth.

In my head, I had all these strange scenarios going on--some scary and intimidating, and I wasn't quite sure what was happening. Everything was going crazy around me, and I had this sense of fear in my chest. I tried to explain it to my boyfriend, but couldn't get the words out.  We couldn't communicate verbally at all. I could think about what I wanted to say, but couldn't say it. My other predominant memories for the next 3 hours (until about 3 a.m.) were guilt at not being able to get up to help my friend move, worrying I was never going to stop tripping, and not knowing what was happening.

It finally occurred to me I was tripping and on something similar to my first acid trip. This calmed me down some, and I told myself to enjoy the experience.  For the next hour my bf and I moved to the living room and listened to music (DJ Shadow and DJ Krush were particularly good) and looking at the art on the walls. The images were 3-D and I felt like I could step inside them. I was enjoying that.  I also noticeably felt very cold, although my BF didn't. I had to wrap myself in a blanket.

Around 4 a.m. we returned to bed and were still tripping really HARD. I felt a lot of anxiety about not being able to sleep and tossed and turned for maybe two hours. My BF was able to fall asleep, but I would shut my eyes and see neon tracers and geometric designs all over.  Lots of pink and orange colors. The white ceiling was bumpy and took on a stalagmite look.  I had to urinate a lot.

I think I fell into a fitful sleep around 6 a.m., sometime before the sun came up.  We woke up around 9 a.m. and realized we were STILL tripping and this freaked us both out. We both didn't want to feel that way. I had to call my friend and tell her I couldn't help her move in the morning, but would help her unload in the afternoon.  The intense visuals, although still apparent, had started to calm down, and my boyfriend and I were able to communicate verbally finally. We talked some things through and he calmed me down.

After that I started to really enjoy myself. The visuals were less intimidating and everything was very bright. I felt happy, and realized I was having fun. We both got up and showered. I took a walk by myself to the store, called some friends on my cell, and went and bought some stuff for breakfast (this was now around 11:30 a.m.).  I wasn't having as many visuals, but things were still bright, and I could still feel some confusion and 'trippiness' in how I was feeling and acting.  It's spring and all the flowers on the trees looked beautiful. It was sunny out and I felt very happy. I thought I'd like to try a smaller dose of Foxy while taking a hike. It seemed much more interesting outside--much like mushrooms.

When I got to the store, they had all these food samples. I was hungry and tried all these samples. It was immensely enjoyable, and it seemed like food tasted better than normal.

I returned to my bf's house. We cooked and ate breakfast. We felt a sense of peace and happiness and had some great realizations. We were able to talk about the night before, and although it had seemed difficult at the time, we realized it had been important and meaningful.

I left his house around 2pm, and still felt some mild effects of the drug. I had to drive an hour away to help  my friend move, which I was able to do. I really enjoyed the drive, as it was very sunny, and the music in my car stereo seemed particularly enjoyable.

Later that night (around 7pm), we took a little bit more--maybe about 2-3mg. I felt the effects, but it was very subtle. I felt silly and sociable and was very relaxed.

I didn't really notice any negative 'body' effects that people typically report except muscle tenseness--clenching of the fists similar to what happens with amphetamines.  Also, my mouth felt really dry.</bodytext></report>
