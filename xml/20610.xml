Im an artist. I play piano and drums. I paint. I write. I think. I feel. I love to use my body and mind, explore them to the deepest regions. I love sport, and I learn kong-fu. I use to be overweight, extremely shy and anxious about anything, and I used to smoke, so the word 'change' got more meaning for me than the word 'god'. Can you imagine any greater bliss for a person like me then hearing colors, seeing music, tasting emotions and being elevated to another, higher state of mind and soul? If you do, let me know, but I don't. And so it began.

My past experiences with drugs include alcohol, marijuana, hashish, heroin, meth, MDMA, MDE and MDA (which I liked the most). Wow..long list. Gives the impression that Im experienced drug user. I am not. I've only done a bit of every kind (except alcohol and pot). I've never tripped before, and I wanted to use my virgin mind to obtain the strongest most unforgettable drug related experience of my life! I've done A LOT of research about mind alternative chemicals. And by A LOT I really mean A LOT!! I've chosen to combine 2C-B and DOB for my first ever trip experience. I regard myself to be a very open-minded person, but not ready yet to deal with the ego dissolving effect that mushrooms or LSD has. I've wanted to experience art, and yet to remain rather intact to reality, more or less.
/n
/n
Set and setting: I've psyched myself for that experience for many many months. A week prior I've increased my kong-fu practicing and started to take antioxidants, 2-HTP and vitamins. During that week Ive also stopped drinking alcohol and smoking pot. I've meditated every day. I've fasted for about 30 hours before dosing.

I've planned to take the drugs at my friends birthday party in my home. There were 6 of us, 5 of them are well known to me, and well experienced with drugs. The atmosphere was GREAT! Everybody planned to take either LSD, MDMA or 2C-B, two of my friends combined it all (out little group really loves to experiment with drug combinations). The lights were off, two lava lamps, a black light lamp and several candles gave out the only light. Soothing psychedelic music in the background. Phone was off, no plans for the next two days. It was just perfect.

T-0:00. We opened the night by really strong hashish brownies, which tasted amazingly good (hashish really goes well with dark chocolate). Afterwards, several of us started to smoke some pot, but I just rolled myself two big joints for later. I've wanted to smoke one joint when peaking on the MDMA, and another one later when peaking on the trip. One hour after consuming that wonderful brownie, I felt the first touch of THC running through my body. 
/n
/n
T-1:00. I crushed to powder my E (big big heavy white superman pill. The biggest Ive even seen), dissolved 0.75 of it in a glass of OJ and drank it. 
/n
/n
T-1:40. Oh my god, here we go. Let the best experience of my life begin. The first waves of MDMA rushed through my body. When combining with the hashish, it produced a very warm and utopic feeling. I felt like walking the path toward heaven, knowing Ill get there tonight. A big smile took over my face, and we all started to talk excitedly. 
/n
/n
T-2:00. DAMN THAT PILL IS GOOD! The hashish made me enter a whole new state of mind, and the E add its own strong magical empathic touch to it. I music flowed wonderfully through me, I was totally spelled by it. This is the best time Ive ever had.
/n
/n
T-2:10. Peaking! My body shakes with pleasure. My soul blossoms with happiness. Time for the joint! I light it, and inhale deeply. Its so easy to inhale deep while being on E. Ohhh thats good shit. Wow thats good shit! Holy fuck thats good shit!! My heart started pounding maddlesslly (which I rather like). Waves of psychedelic energy buzzed through me. I felt like my mind is making love to this joint. I can't exactly say that this is the highest Ive ever been (the highest Ive ever been was when I took 2 MDA pills and smoked enough grass to kill a small animal), but I can say that this is the most pleasurable high Ive ever entered. I've totally forgot about my tripping plans, as I was swept away by the party.
/n
/n
T-2:25. Oops, NOW in peaking!
/n
/n
T-4:00. Starting to drift down, but still feeling AWESOME!. Pity, Im coming down while my friends are all still tripping really hard with no signs of relief. I wished I was tri..GOD DAMNED IT!!!
/n
Took one capsule with 15mg 2C-B and 1.5mg DOB. I've also took 1000mg vitamin C, 500mg vitamin E and 300mg vitamin A. Enthusiastically Ive tolled my friends that Ive just taken the chemicals, and they all screamed 'WOOOOOW!! CONGRAGULATIONS'. A strong wave of excitement washed over me, as if for a second I was peaking again.
/n
/n
T-5:00. Nothing. Still drifting down.
/n
T-5:30. Something is up. Something is changing. I can't pinpoint it, but its there.
/n
/n
T-5:50. I feel like I took more E. Im back rolling my ass off, but in a slightly different, less aggressive, more pure kind of way.
/n
/n
T-6:00. Everything moves! I can't stop laughing, nor can my friends who simply enjoy my reactions to this first trip. We all start to talk about their first trips, and about their best drug experienced. I fill charged with a new source of energy! My mind is racing, coming up with the most original thoughts Ive ever had! 
/n
/n
T-6:20. If god is a woman (why not actually? Have you seen Dogma?) I fill like Im making love to her right now. The empathy is enormous!! The utopia is almost drowning me! Im totally overrun by bliss and goodness.
/n
/n
T-6:30. Ok, things are getting weird. Trails start to appear and colors start to get a new depth. Everything is liquidish and alive looking. Its freaking cool! Nothing could ever prepared me for such an adventure. Suddenly Im noticing the music was off. It was off for quite a while, but non of us noticed. I put on some rather energetic and extremely weird psychedelic music, and then it hit me.
/n
/n
T-6:40. EVERYTHING is vibrating with colors! Flashes of color illuminate from everything! Everything shimmers and gleams! Everything is so shiny and positive! Everything is so..trippy!
/n
Finally, Im really tripping. The whole room is breathing. Things are getting aliveness and presentness. Everything look kind of polished, round, perfect! Even the music in some way.
/n
/n
T-7:00. I don't know if Im peaking or not. This feelings just getting stronger and stronger! Im overwhelmed by colors and blissfullness! So much inspiration flows to my mind, I wish I could write! I've traveled to my out personal world. The feeling of socialness has replaced itself with amazement and surrender to this new state of mind. I honestly feel like a new person. I wish you were all with me now in this state of mind. I wish I could somehow record this plane of existence and somehow show it to you from my own personal point of view. 
/n
/n
T-7:30. Raw, pure colors swirling everywhere. This whole experience has a very sexual feeling to it. I feel like my mind and soul, instead of arguing and debating with one another, are making love to one another, producing all there colors and feelings that engulf the person that they belong to. I felt..perfect. The perfectness wasn't involved with all the utopia and other trip related effects. I felt like I could snap right back to baseline right not, and not being disappointed at all, for this perfectness didn't engulfed me everywhere like the trip does, it lay secure within me. I felt as if it was there all the time, waiting for the right time to come up, and 'what a better place then here, what better time then now.' (R.A.T.M)
/n
/n
I could go on writing on the next five hours FOREVER! But Ill rather not have you sitting in front of the computer screen all day.
/n
/n
T-12:30. The colors have called down a bit. Still bright and intense, radiating from every object, especially people and sources of light, yet they seem less aggressive, less energetic, more flowing. Everything is liquidish. I can't even remember who my house looked like when it was normal, this really psyched my out, but in a good way. I like to be hit hard. I like to be completely overwhelmed and overrun. I like to be shocked. I have a never ending thirst for intensity and thrill. I can easily surrender, leaving all what I learned to know and trust behind me, just to flow with the nature of things. This experience really elevated me to a whole new level of thinking, feeling and being. If you use drugs in a superficial way, you'll get a superficial meaning to the effect. But if you are really willing to go deep into the world of spiritual alteredness, you'll be amazed at the amount of knowledge the drug can aim you towards.
/n
/n
T-13:00. I can't believe Im still tripping. Definitely in a much lower level then before, but still. Visuals are still there, music is still spelling, and I feel extremely exhausted and relaxed. Completely forgot about the joint, and not I finally smoke it. It feels grate, deepens the visual a bit more, and further relaxes my pleased satisfied soul. There's a slight body load, yet I seem to enjoy that too. I kinda love the feeling of recovering, maybe its because Im in a very good physical condition. Im taking some more vitamins, and drinking some coffee. Everybody when to sleep except me and two of my friends who combined LSD, 2C-B, MDMA, hashish and pot. They decide to take half a hit more of MDMA, and I decide to join then. I snort the 0.25 pill that I saved for later (I also planned to snort it while tripping, but, like I said, I was totally swept away). 
/n
/n
T-13:20. Damn! That really brought me back to life! My friends also started rolling again. We open all the windows and let some fresh warm afternoon air to clear my smoky living room. I step outside, close my eyes and feel the sun charging me up like a snake that just finished tripping in his cave and wants to refresh itself :)
/n
/n
T-15:00. The additional 0.25 E is starting to wear off now, suprisingly in a very gentle way. I hardly get any hangovers after doing E, I just remain cloudy and dizzy, and on two occasions I had a slight depression two day afterwards, but I didn't pay any attention to it due to my knowledge that its chemical based and will ware off soon.
/n
/n
T-17:00. Everybody left now, leaving me with some pot. I smoked a few bowls, got a shower, went on the computer, submitted this experience report, and Im now all ready for bed.

Don't ever let life pass you by!
