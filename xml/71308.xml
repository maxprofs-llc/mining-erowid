Me and my cousins were bored one night. Tatum New Mexico is so small everything is just a bike ride away, so we went to town and country and bought a 2000 mg pack of ginseng juice. We went around the side of town and country and drank it all in 1 gulp.

All together it was fun and a good party drug with some not so fun side effects. I may try it again but I'll research other things first.</bodytext></report>
