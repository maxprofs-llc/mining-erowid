Well, it was a Saturday night, and my friends and I had spent the first part of it watching a great climbing movie. 'Pilgrimage' with Chris Sharma. Anyway it was about 11:30 and my friend and I decided to eat some mushrooms and take a late walk through a botanical garden that was close by. He ate a 1/8th oz. and I ate 2.5g. We also split a 20mg Adderall to help us have energy for the next few hours, since it was pretty late to start a trip. The Adderall ended up having a greater effect on my trip than I expected.

After eating the mushrooms, we drove up to where this garden/park/arboretum is and hopped the fence since it was closed for the night. We wandered around admiring the bizarre things that they have in this garden for a while, and eventually headed out into the wilder area of the park. It is worth mentioning that I am more sensitive than most to mushrooms. The 2.5g was giving me intense visuals in the darkness, so much so that it made it hard for me to see, at least for the initial part of the trip. The tracers from moving my hand in front of me were so intense it was hard to tell which one was actually my hand. We then hopped across a stream and hopped another fence to exit the park. We then laid on the gravel road on the opposite side of the fence for some time, talking about various things while I watched arching lines dance in between the stars above us.

This is where I first started to notice something was different than a normal shroom trip. For one, our topic of conversation was odd. We mostly talked about crazy things we had done in our past, particularly driving fast cars at ridiculous speeds. The mood was not introspective at all; we were having a great time recounting these pretty crazy (dangerous, risky) things we had done. We eventually got up and started walking down the road back to where we came from. But, as fate would have it, we met four kids walking up the road carrying a 30 pack of beer. They said they were heading up the hill to do some drinking, and we in turn told them we were tripping, and had just come from that way. At this point my friend decided we should go back up the hill with them, and there was obviously no changing his mind.

Now another odd thing happened. We were walking up the hill, and the thought crossed my mind that these kids might try something on us, knowing that we were tripping. I hadn't met these people before, we were out a ways from civilization, they looked a little shady, and there were four of them and two of us. Now this thought would normally make me uncomfortable, especially while tripping, but now I absurdly felt ready for a fight. I was ready to go at the drop of a hat, and I was on mushrooms!! Definitely not normal for me. Of course it turned out that these guys had nothing but good intentions, so it never became a problem.

At this point we started uphill, and my friend started getting a little crazy. Before we knew it, we were battling our way through thorny undergrowth going straight uphill, and we quickly lost all but 1 of the other guys. We eventually found a ridge trail and started heading up that at a pretty good clip. We eventually got pretty high up the hill and we were treated to a view of the city that was absolutely spectacular. By this time both of us felt nearly sober. I was worried about climbing so high in the middle of the night on mushrooms, and eventually my fears got the better of me and I turned back down.

My friend had definitely gone a little nuts by this time and was well ahead of me on the next ridge. The one kid was back with me and clearly drunk, so I had misgivings about leaving him, but he wanted to keep going, and you just can't tell a drunken kid what to do. So, even though I was concerned he might fall off the mountain and/or get himself hurt, I headed back down. I knew my friend could handle himself, and we had been whooping and hollering at each other the whole night and I could still hear his call echoing from the next ridge.

Getting down was easier than I expected since I just followed trails, and didn't battle the brush like I had on the way up. I got back to my car at about 4:00 am. I reckon I climbed 1,000 - 1,500 vertical feet, and my friend did about 2,000. Feeling completely sober, I drove around for a while looking for my friend, but eventually gave up and went home.

I got a quite a surprise when I looked at myself in the mirror back home, because my pupils were still very dilated and my face was warping a little too. Oops, guess I wasn't really that sober. I talked to my friend the next day, and he confirmed that he reached the summit of this ridge we were climbing, and said he found the other kid passed out on the trail on his way back down, and had to give him a hand getting off the mountain.

In conclusion, the Adderall definitely made me more talkative and added a bit of aggressiveness to the trip. We were climbing like madmen, and I think the third kid followed us just because we seemed to have this crazy balls-out attitude. In addition, we both felt like we stopped tripping after a couple hours, but I think we just focused on the speedy aspect once we started climbing, even though the mushrooms were definitely still working, as I realized when I got home.

As a footnote, I know some people probably read the whole splitting up on the mountain in the middle of the night as pretty dangerous, and I suppose from a normal point of view it was. I was definitely worried about the two people still climbing when I was heading back down, more the drunk kid than my friend. That whole trip was just so full of insanity and bizarre thoughts (Christ we were on a mountain in the middle of night completely bent on drugs in this manic sort of expedition with no supplies except a little water and jackets). I really had no way to decide how worried I should actually have been since there was no perspective to put the whole thing into.

I can safely say the mere 10mg of Adderall (with which I normally only experience mild effects) significantly altered the mood and tone of both of our trips. Be careful and peace!</bodytext></report>
