**I take 30 mg of Adderall a day by prescription, so 25 mg is no big deal to my system alone, and I've rolled many times over the past three years.**

I started the night off with my boyfriend and we both took 25 mg of Adderall orally around 9 pm. Both of us have used various amphetamines before and we only intended this to give us a little boost for the long night ahead, thinking that it would be no different than a caffeine pill when mixed with E.  We went to a show at 11 and dropped our double-stacked HQ tabs along with some friends, who had had nothing else in their systems.

Around 11:45 my boyfriend and I started to have intense visuals, while our friends were already enjoying their rolls.  My boyfriend and I started to get very paranoid...we werent feeling any of the sensory or empathetic effects of E that we expected; neither of us wanted to kiss or touch each other, but we NEEDED to be held by the other, as we were getting freaked the fuck out. Our eyes were vibrating back and forth so badly, almost from one side entirely over to the other; the room was imploding on us and our eyes and brains felt like they were on fire; if we tried to fix our eyes on any one thing, it started shaking back and forth.  Neither of us yet realized that it could possibly be the adderall/E interaction that was jacking us around so much; I started to be VERY scared that we had gotten PMA or DXM tabs, but our friends who took the exact same pills were having the time of their lives.  At 12:30, we neither felt the desire to move nor to talk, but rather just to stand there.  Thankfully before our trip went really awry, the show was shut down ('crack house laws').

On the cab ride home, I kept feeling for my pulse; my heart was jumping from about 80 bpm to 160 bpm every minute. Neither of us could control our breathing - we were being overwhelmed by intense visuals that were making us both nauseous.  Back at my apartment, our four other friends, who took the same tabs as us, were having very great rolls...but we were having such a hard time handling the trip that we couldnt even be in the same room as them..not to mention we were starting to scare them.  We spent the greater part of the remaining night in the bathtub with soothing music on and candles burning, talking each other back down to earth. At about 4 am, we were finally down enough to reappear from our recovery session.

Moral of the story:  in my opinion don't ever EVER mix Adderall and ecstasy, no matter how much of a hardass you think you are; these two drugs do not complement each other.</bodytext></report>
