The day started off by me and one of my friends doing shots from a bottle of vodka. We continued to take shots until I was pretty buzzed. I ended up drinking about a fifth of vodka to myself. I was to the point where I was 'blacked out' and don't remember much of what happened an hour after this.

We had previously bought some magic mushrooms to take that night. These were very good mushrooms and the caps were gold in color. We ate them around 2 hours after the drinking. I barely remember eating them and even forget that I ate them. But then once they hit me I got a little scared and wasn't sure what was happening. But my friends calmed me down and I began to trip.

Just as a background, I have taken shrooms at least 8 times before this. I knew what to expect and how to handle it. I remember laying in my friends living room and looking at the ceiling and the lines in it looked as if they were waving and moving back and forth. I stared at the ceiling for quite some time and was very entertained. Then I seen a wooden statue that had been carved to look like a Native American. I looked at the face and I could have swore that it was trying to talk to me and I thought it was evil. I had to turn it towards the wall because I couldn't handle looking at it.

I liked the experience with alcohol due to the fact that it increased the effect and also I felt the shrooms a lot sooner than I ever had. But I was kind of mad the next day because I didn't remember much and kept hearing new things from my friends that I did that night. But overall it was one of my favorite trips.</bodytext></report>
