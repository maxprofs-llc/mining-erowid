Ive been on Effexor XR (venlafaxine) for about 2 months now and on Abilify (aripiprazole) and Depakote ER (divalproex) for about 4 days.  I have a mild form of bipolar disorder and these are my meds.  My psychiatrist who is extremely intelligent and has PhDs in numerous medical fields told me that my cannabis use would not negatively combine with these medications in any way.

The other day before a party I got really high, I hadn't smoked in over 30 days so I was really messed up.  The high was about the same as any other high and I didnt really experience anything different.  The nitrous was just as good as always, but even better because of the weed.  It makes me trip out a little, I like it.  I didnt take enough hydrocodone (5/500) to really feel anything so that was a little pointless.  All in all, Im writing this to tell how my medications didnt really affect my other recreational drugs and vice versa.</bodytext></report>
