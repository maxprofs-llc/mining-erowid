I had been looking forward to and reading and studying intensly about Magic Mushrooms when I finally found an individual to get some from. I had always had a very intense interest in these mushrooms, and read about them before I took them. There was a group of about 5 of us, and we decided to induce the mushies at an open field, right across from a big church and park.

I had bought $100 worth, or about 5 eights. We all sat down in a circle, and ate the mushrooms, evenly distributing them between my girlfirend and I. The other people I was with had only 1 eight with them, so I gave them a couple extra stems and caps. I had probably eaten about 2 1/2 eights, but started to randomly eat a cap or two an hour into the trip. We had also eaten 2 1000g tabs of Vitamin C, as this supposedly helps speed up and intensify the trip. After sitting down finally after eating my share and waiting for this great experience to take place, I all of the sudden found myself looking up into a great big hole in the sky, with the rest of the world not around me.

It was like I was on (and I actually was!)a different astral plane with just the stars and the sky. I felt as if I could communicate directly with the earth, as well as whatever else was out there. One minute I was asking myself when this was going to kick in, and the next minute I was thrown into this exiting world of psychedelic wonder. The clouds started to make a wide array of faces and shapes, and the tree lines that seemed to surround us had now dissapeared, only to leave me with the divine outer world. The others in the group had been having a wonderful experience, but hadn't had such a large dosage of the mushies as I had. I was in a completely different world, and the plane was very safe, and looked as if this is where I was supposed to be.

The peak lasted about 2 hours, with the total trip lasting about 8 hours. We had done this in the dark, my first experience in the dark. My eyes were watering like I was crying, but I wasn't sad at all. I also felt as if I knew so much about the inner and outer worlds, and every time I tried to explain it, I couldn't. I would start a sentence, but was unable to finish it.

All in all, this was such a wonderful experience, with no scary or bad things happening.</bodytext></report>
