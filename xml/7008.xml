It was my first nutmeg experience, and I decided to take  of a shaker at about 8:30am (half an hour before school began). The first effects were apparent at about 9:30 when I started to get a bad stomach ache, and this continued for about forty minutes. Eventually this left, and I started to feel a bit light headed, and very awake.

By 11:30, I had completely swung around again and was feeling extremely fatigued and out of energy.

I remained in that state for another hour and a half, when at 1:00 I began to feel very smart, and it occurred to me that everybody else in the school seemed to be on drugs. They were all making really stupid comments, and all seemed kind of different. It was very hard to think about things, because there were hundreds of thoughts running through my head.

I felt this way for a couple more hours, and started to get a very dry mouth, and my eyes became really bloodshot. At about 4:00, I felt as though Id just been smoking cannabis all day, and I remained like that for about six more hours, until I went to bed.

Some of the things I noticed about nutmeg were that I got a really dry mouth (even the day after), my eyes got quite red towards the end of the experience, and I had absolutely no concept of time. In what seemed like ten minutes, four hours had passed.

I recommend it to anybody interested in expanding their horizons, but be careful how much you take. Its a straaaaange experience.</bodytext></report>
