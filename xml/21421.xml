I first tried Dilaudid (hydromorphone) nearly a year ago, but didn't start using it regularly up until a few months ago. One of my family members gets a prescription for them, which is the only way I could ever afford to use them because around here they go for between $5-15 per milligram. The only method I ever use to ingest the drug is intravenously. From what I have read and heard from other users, Dilaudid has to be given by injection (I.V., I.M., S.C.) for its full effects to be shown. Snorting or swallowing the pills seems have very mild effects unless taken in excess (12-20mg). So, for the most part, if you're going to pay $15-35 for a 4mg pill or will not be able to acquire the drug anytime soon, injection is the only way to go. For the most part, I am against injecting any drug that isn't already in liquid form, but Dilaudid has a unique make-up. It breaks down in water without having to be cooked down. NOTE: this is ONLY true for the name brand (Knoll; has 'K' on one side and '1', '2', '3', or '4' on the other). The water will be slightly discolored, but something about the pharmacology of Dilaudid allows it to be injected after just being crushed and dissolved. This is currently the only pill that I know can be safely injected without being cooked down (strained through cotton, heated, etc.). Now that I've given a little information about the drug, I'll share an experience I recorded yesterday.

I received a 4mg Dilaudid yesterday at around 12pm. The pill itself is extremely small, round and yellow. I retrieved an unused 1cc syringe and a straw and head to the bathroom. I inserted the pill into the straw, folded it over, and crushed it with a lighter. After that, I removed the plunger from the syringe and poured the powder down into the barrel. The final step after this was to draw up around 30 units of hot water and shake the syringe for about 30 seconds (until there are no solid particles left in the water).

0:00 - I register dark red and push down the plunger. Just 15 seconds afterwards, I can feel something starting in my chest. At first you're not sure exactly what the feeling is, but you damn sure know SOMETHING is coming. The only way I can describe the feeling is that all your muscles tighten quickly and then immediately become completely relaxed. The feeling starts in your chest and moves throughout your whole body in a matter of seconds. The rush lasts about a minute and can only be described as heaven on earth. Hydromorphone's abuse potential comes primarily from the fact that it's rush is nearly identical to that of heroin.

0:10 - The rush is gone now, but I am left with a warm feeling throughout my body and a euphoria that comes in waves, especially when closing and opening the eyes (nodding). The high is similar to oxycodone, but is not nearly as sedating and hydromorphone is more euphoric in my opinion.

0:45 - Still feeling great, although I've become slightly used to the feeling and sometimes forget that I'm still high, but as soon as I think about it, I feel it again.

1:30 - The euphoria has dimished slightly, but is still very apparent.

2:00-4:00 - Feeling no pain, but the euphoria is subsiding rapidly.

In my opinion, Dilaudid is a great drug, but like all opiates is extremely psychologically and physically addictive. It's dangers speak for themselves, but for me it's my little piece of heaven.</bodytext></report>
