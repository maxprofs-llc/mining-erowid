When I tried 1,4 BDO and MDMA combined, it had been appx. one  year since my first MDMA experience (using about once a month) and three months since my first GHB experience.  This would be my first time with 1,4 BDO, although we all thought it was the much weaker GHB we had been getting for three months.  It was not!

I was out with about 10 friends, and after a night of clubbing and appx. 2 pills each (maybe 125 mg of MDMA total? I like weaker pills), we were on the comedown and decided to take appx. 1/4 teaspoon (or less) of 1,4 BDO.   For three months my friends and I liked to take a little GHB on the comedown to make the roll come back and to help relax us, and I came to realize that I LOVED the combo of GHB and MDMA as it made me much more talkative, lovey-dovey, happy, and hyper, whereas MDMA alone often left me floored and unable to move much, and GHB alone just made me sleep.  (Keep in mind we basically knew how much GHB to take, and not too much to make ourselves pass out or vomit, etc.)

After only about 5-10 mins of taking the 1,4 BDO, the girls in the group (and a couple guys) started moaning and being unable to speak right and looked like they were in pain... but actually were feeling the best they had ever felt!!!   I can only describe this first time in two words: body orgasms.

We felt like our bodies were orgasming all over and it was the most insane roll I had ever had, and I NEVER feel sexual on just MDMA alone, or even plan GHB with MDMA, so this was very new.  This led to the girls just rolling around moaning for a couple hours.  (No, nothing happened.)

After this began to decline, something else unexpected happened - I began to get very, very emotional and cry when the music was extremely pretty or when I thought about things like God, the universe, etc., and I did not do this on MDMA alone.  The combo of these two substances seemed to open my mind and feelings up EVEN MORE than MDMA alone, and in a very positive way.

I have to say that I DO NOT LIKE most drugs because I do not like to feel 'drugged' or 'fucked up.'  I have tried and will not ever try again many substances.  But MDMA and 1,4 BDO clearly were something I (and my friends) got positive experiences from.  Some of us found it much more sexual/sensual that MDMA alone, some of us found it a lot happier, energetic, or it just made the roll longer (or come back).

For the year after that, every time I rolled I took some 1,4 BDO on the comedown (about an hour after the peak began to let off.) I never took them at the same time, as I thought I might get too fucked up, and i never took the 1,4 BDO first. (I DID try it alone once, and I puked, and I tried it with coke - which I normally hate - and I felt messed up and wanted it to end.) A couple times I miscalculated the dose and got nauseous, but never got dangerously ill.  I experienced such amazing mental and emotional revelations that I would never take these times back.  I even began to write down poems or lyrics/songs when I was one MDMA and 1,4 BDO, and was able to actually make usable songs from these when I was sober later on.

Unfortunately, for several months the 1,4 BDO + MDMA has not felt the same to me. I get talkative, more honest, energetic and want to dance a lot more than MDMA itself when I have the combo, but I no longer have such intense physical or emotional feelings... I am hoping that if I take a lot of time off from the substances that it might get back to the way it used to feel, but I have a feeling it won't.

I have tried this combo both at clubs and at home, and I would recommend doing a LOT LESS 1,4 BDO when in public, as it can sneak up on me and make me appear too messed up (even if I feel fine.)  And never, ever, ever treat 1,4 BDO like an alcohol shot and 'just down it.'  You will feel like death warmed over, I had some friends do it, plus it can be extremely dangerous not to know your personal dose and limit.  When I use this combo now, I keep a piece of paper where I write down when my friends and/or I took the MDMA and the 1,4 BDO so we do not accidentally double-dose, and this has helped us each time.</bodytext></report>
