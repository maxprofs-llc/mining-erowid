Smoked 4 pipes of fresh leaf, and one pipe of flowers/seeds. 5+minutes - feeling something, nervous jittery, the curtain is moving upward slowly and doging from side to side ever so slightly. Doubt this is a 'placebo' effect.

15+minutes - monitors refresh rate more noticable, appreciable connection to geometric/psychedelic patterns, pupils constricted
