This was a very stupid move on my part on trying not to let my parents know that I did drugs. I had a bit of an addiction to where if I wasn't messed up I needed something to mess me up.  So I was out of pot, no money for Robotussin, so I went to my moms purse.  Shes bi-polar (manic depressive) t, and she had some good stuff in there.  I figured the more i took the better i would feel...WRONG!

So I dug out four .5 mg klonopins, and one 100mg Darvocet.  My friends came by, I popped em, and headed out... This is how it all happened;

T+15:  Feeling good.

T+30:  Oh boy, I forgot I took the Darvocet! It's kickin' my ass fast.

T+35:  Can't move, friends describe me as my face melting off.
/n

T+40-60: Went home passed out in bedroom.

Ok that wasn't fun at all...Being that I woke up 14 hours later! My parents were kickin and yellin at me, and almost took me to detox.  When I woke up they asked me why I had fallen asleep at 5, through the next morning (when I dont fall asleep until the wee hours of the morning, so I told them what any pothead would say...'I didnt feel good'. And a couple days later the school drug tested me and i got suspended for two weeks from that Darvocet.</bodytext></report>
