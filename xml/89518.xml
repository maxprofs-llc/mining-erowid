The following is a dual experience from a snow day this week where my friend (who we shall refer to as K) and I took 60 mg of 5-Meo-DALT each. Our previous experiences are many. I have taken 30 mg of DALT on its own (see my other experience vault a simple yet oddly stimulating trip), we have also twice used it to boost other psychedelics: acid, shrooms, and elemi oil which worked well but made it seem like that was where DALTs functionality ended

That is until we decided to be really intelligent college students and, when one dose seemed somewhat lackluster, we doubled the dose.

We orally took the 60 mg via capsules on an empty stomach. Note: I had the flu, not a cold, the fucking flu also, we both smoked weed for the come-up, as past experience shows that it reduces psychedelic come-up discomfort and generally boosts the trip.

After about 15 minutes I started to feel the rush of the DALT starting to kick in It has a very twitchy, and pulsey feel to it. Its very stimulating Either way this was odd to me because it was a bit uncomfortable but in a way that weed usually kills before trips. The come-up rush just kept getting more and more intense. In fact at the 30-minute point it was quite uncomfortable and overwhelming K was cooking dinner because we were expecting a simple yet oddly stimulating trip. BAHAHA. Silly nave K and I Anyway I was pacing and feeling very anxious as my mental state began to change and I had no idea how she was cooking food; I would have been incapable.

The come-up, even with the weed, was kicking my ass and I was not ready for it. It was more intense then a come up on 4 quality doses of acid. So I decided to try and dull it a bit and take 1 mg Xanax (Note: I have a huge benzo tolerance which ended up being pretty damn irrelevant because by the time it kicked in we were basically done tripping). Also, I threw up, but that was probably the flu We were both definitely very uncomfortable though for sure

Ks come-up was a little bit different because at this point she was still cooking dinner. Instead she first noticed an extreme discomfort from trying to pay attention and focus on a single task and that time was running much, much slower than normal. However as soon as dinner was finished cooking the full force of the come-up and almost immediately noted anxiety-like feelings including a much increased heart rate. After only about 3 bites of dinner slight nausea kicked in and she gave up completely on attempting to act like the drug wasnt affecting her.

It was by this point that the drug started to switch from come-up to full effects and it was fucking nutso. I was still pacing to try and kill the discomfort/anxiety and K was lying down to try to keep her heart rate down in hopes to do the same thing. She elected to not take a benzo in order to see where the trip was headed and with the hope that the discomfort would end with the come-up, soon.

Yep, so we were tripping HARD. Literally, all we did was just talk about how hard we were tripping over and over again. We both came to the conclusion that in its own way it was the hardest wed ever tripped, but definitely in its own way The trip is very hard to describe. It wasnt very intensely OEV based, despite strongly having them (Note: K says she had CEVs while laying down). It was just a very, very heavy change in mindset and perception. It was very overwhelming, but not in a specific way; it was very much in a holy shit what is going on sort of way. Although, confusion was prominent because we werent expecting such a trip There was an INTENSE feeling of waking up mysteriously ALL THE TIME. I dont really even know how to explain this fully. We have experienced this before with lower doses too. K says that its like youre suddenly not very sure what things have actually happened and what youve imagined. BUT you know that youre not imagining any of it. Yet every time its like emerging from a dream. It was just bizarre. Wed just look at each other and say holy shit, then 3 seconds later (felt like 3 minutes) wed say holy fucking shit. In my pacing I just fell to the ground a few times almost uncontrollably, just being slapped by the DALT.  One time in particular I was concealed from K by my laundry bag and K, after a waking up experience, wasnt sure if I was actually there she needed to ask me for confirmation. Also this was in the T+60 to 90 minute range.

My mental state changed pretty intensely but it was very much HEAVY yet still simple when compared to acid. There wasnt much patterning or creative thinking etc, perhaps because we were so damn disoriented. There was no introspective part of the drug really, in fact all I could think about was how hard I was tripping. Either way, if theres some way to control the come-up more, it would be a nice lets get fucked up for a few hours drug. Not the drug of choice for me to lie under a tree and ponder my lifes purpose thats for acid. Although at the time I felt it would be great for wandering around since I felt the desire to move, K says however that she would not like waking up in a strange place and that she was happy to be contained in the comfort of our apartment.

But yeah, the heavy tripping subsided to low level tripping at around T+120 to 150 minutes. At this point my Xanax started to kick in and my trip dwindled down a bit more than Ks. Her comedown still had some OEVs whereas mine had very little. We also noticed some gorgeous patterning in the tree outside our apartment freshly dowsed in ice from the ice storm. It really was very beautiful and probably the most acid-like part of the trip for me. We remained at this lower level for around 2 hours before deciding it was time for bed, so we smoked a bit more and took 5mg of Vicodin and 1 mg of Xanax each to put us to sleep.

For the record we think, if ready for it, 60 mg could be a very appropriate recreational dose.

Yep, so we dont know what else to write except this shit is wayyyy more powerful then we gave it credit. Twas quite the experience indeed</bodytext></report>
