[/n: The most common reason people have emergency medical situations when using MDMA (Ecstasy) is hyperthermia (dangerous over-heating).  MDMA alters the body's ability to cope with changes in environmental temperature, decreases sensitivity to pain, and the positive feelings can lead to not noticing or discounting warning signs that occur.  Taking MDMA in a hot tub or other extremely warm environment can increase the risk of hyperthermia.  Studies in laboratory animals have also shown that higher body temperatures increase the neurotoxic effects of MDMA.]

I spent all day without eating anything and drinking only a cup of tea. That proved to be a very hard thing to do, I could not get food out of my mind, so by the time I dropped the pill at about 5pm I was very hungry and for that reason somewhat displeased.

Right after dropping I could feel a strange sensation as if though my skin was moving around which was probably due to the tiny amount of MDMA absorbed through my mouth. After that I didn't feel much accept for some excitement about doing E for the first time in over year. At around 5:20pm me and a buddy of mine set out to make it to the bus to get to campus. At this point I was even more excited and definitely beginning to feel the stimulant effects of the drug. Then at around 5:40 or so just as we were crossing a very busy street the MDMA took a firm hold over my mind and my body. I noticed that I was very happy, and no longer had to be concerned with my well being and could TRULY pay attention to the problems and needs of others. This resulted in what felt like a very deep and worthwhile conversation with my friend during our bus ride to campus.

Once we got to campus my friend had to go work and I headed straight for the gym noticing how surprisingly pleasant talking to acquaintances I happened to bump into was. Kind of like thinking everyone forgot about your birthday, getting back to your place without expecting much and then the lights come on and all your friends yell Happy Birthday. Once I got to the gym I got a water from the vending machine which felt too good to be true not only when I drank it but when I spilled it all over myself and looked like an idiot. My appearance did not concern me slightly as I was under the impression that people would understand like I understood and leave me be.

After changing into my trunks I entered the pool area which instead of being stuffy and smelling like chlorine felt like a beach somewhere in Turkey right by the Red Sea. There rather then doing laps or any other nonsense that unfortunate people that are unsatisfied with life in general and their physical appearance in particular do I headed right for the hot tub.

Once I got in it felt absolutely amazing. Brilliant ideas that felt like they could make me and the rest of the people in the world permanently happy seemed to wash over me like the bubbles of the hot tub did and it lasted all eternity yet somehow not long enough.

The only coherent thought that makes any sense to me now was the explanation of why life seemed so much more fun and exciting when I was a kid. It seemed so much more exciting because not only did I not know at the time all the things I was capable of but also because I did not know of all the things that I couldn't do no matter what. So back then when I woke up in the morning I had no reason to believe that I wouldn't obtain superhuman powers or experience true love at first sight during the day which made life a lot more exciting and gave me tremendous amounts of motivation. Now that I know for sure what will and will not happen its not half as fun getting up in the morning.

After spending about an hour in the hot tub I was still going strong but was beginning to pay more attention to the body load. My vision seemed a little weird and I was biting the sides of my mouth a lot.  After taking the bus back to my place the MDMA begin ware off. The feeling of unity, understanding and oneness with everyone was gone, ideas that I thought were so brilliant were just rubbish and I felt like I would never be happy again. Fortunately the MDMA was really pure and accept for a little restlessness there was no body crash just a really heavy mental one. I managed to make myself lie down and drift away at which point I experienced some really colorful CEVs that were rather fun. I got up in about 45 minutes at 9:30pm smoked a couple of bowls and had some of the best munchies in my life as I didn't eat all day and had a fridge full of stuff. That pretty much ended the crash, put me in a splendid mood for heaving such an experience and made me sleepy enough to go to bed.

So to conclude Ecstasy+Hot tub= Great Idea (actually many, many great ideas, deep conversations and other stuff people spend a lifetime looking for) and make sure you got some ganja to take the edge off the crash, get some food into your system and be able to go to sleep.</bodytext></report>
