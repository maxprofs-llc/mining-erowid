one fine day i felt the need for a buzz. my friend told me i could get a buzz from a half drunk 2 liter coke bottle by shaking it so co2 builds up. then slowly remove the lid and inhale and hold for 10 seconds. so i tried it it was hard to inhale and hold my breath when i exhaled gasping for breath i felt a very strong buzz sort of a bit of panic and very strong Euphoria only lasted about 30 seconds.</bodytext></report>
