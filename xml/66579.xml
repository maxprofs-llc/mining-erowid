I really love doing Wormwood. It doesn't get you high, but its an experience of its own. Almost as soon as I ingest it I'm overcome with a warm fuzzy feeling along with liny vision. I feel a meditative sensation with a creative touch accompanied by a heightened appreciation of music. It doesn't last long but it's really a great feeling. I love doing it. I just buy Wormwood extract from my local health food store and place it into gelcaps (its far too vile to ingest otherwise).</bodytext></report>
