The first time I tried salt I snorted with a friend. The experience was fun. As I continued 2 experiment I started 2 inject the powder. I cant stay away from it! I dont use everyday but when I do I go on uncontrolled binges for 4 to 5 days at a time. After the first day extreme paranoia sets in. Another danger I have experienced is dehydration to the point of hospital visits. A good drug at small doses but be careful.</bodytext></report>
