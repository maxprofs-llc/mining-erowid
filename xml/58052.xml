I was born with a birth defect, I had two uteruses (uteri). Having two uteri caused me to have stage three (there are only four stages) endometriosis, which is quite possibly the most painful thing I have ever experienced.

However, doctors did not believe me. They thought, since I was only 13 at the time, that I was over-exaggerating my story to get attention, or that I didn't have a very high pain tolerance. Over the course of two years, I was prescribed every pain-killer imaginable, and none of them worked. My pain seemed to get worse and worse as the weeks wore on, and nothing any doctor prescribed to me helped. One day, I collapsed in the kitchen because my pain was so bad that I couldn't stand, and it was then that my father decided to do something. He found some left-over oxycontin from a dental surgery he had a few months previous, and gave two pills to help me.

Surprisingly, the pain washed away. It was a slow gradual relief that I barely noticed, but I just remember waking up for the first time in over a year and not being in pain. It was the most amazing experience of my life. I started taking oxycontin daily, merely as a way of literally being able to get out of bed in the morning. Every time I felt pain coming on, I would take two pills. I fell into the general pattern of taking two pills once I got to school in the morning, two at the end of the school day, and sometimes two at night if the pain was so bad I couldn't sleep.

I had read countless reports of oxycontin being used recklessly, but surprisingly I never thought the drug affected me that way. I never felt as thought I was 'high' or that my reactions were anything but what they were normally. I felt euphoric, but I simply related my feelings of euphoria to the fact that for the first time in years, I was able to go to school without having to come home two hours later because of my pain.

It took five years and two surgeries for my pain to finally go away, and I took oxycontin on an almost regular basis for that entire period. Surprisingly, I never got addicted. I even refused morphine while I was recovering, something my friends told me I was crazy to do. Once I had fully recovered and no longer needed painkillers, I gave my leftover oxycontin to my friends.

A few weeks ago my friend gave me two oxycontins, and asked me to try them with her. After taking the pills, she was extremely euphoric, and was enjoying watching a TV show. I, on the other hand, felt nothing. I had no feelings of euphoria, and none of the sensations described by others who have taken oxycontin recreationally. It has been two years since the last time I took oxycontin for medical purposes, so my tolerance was not increased, yet still I felt nothing. It will always remain a mystery how people can take painkillers recreationally. They have absolutely no effect on my other than taking some of my pain away.</bodytext></report>
