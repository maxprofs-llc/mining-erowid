I wanted to take the trip that would completely flatten me once again, and go perhaps deeper than I have voyaged yet. I had 4 grams Psilocybin mushrooms and 100mg DPT to work with. I have tried the 2 together at 3.5 grams mushrooms + 50mg DPT once before. I wanted to do this right. I waited until my apartment was quiet and my roommates were in bed, so my setting would be solo, in darkness, and in silence. I had this voyage planned for a couple weeks and was excited the moment had come to say the least. Hours before dosing I felt rushes of energy just thinking about the oneness I was hoping to achieve.

2:04 AM - I munch down the mushrooms on peanut butter crackers I have to admit I dont care for the taste of shrooms and this method really disguised the flavor well.

T + :30 - I feel the first alerts from the mushrooms pictures tacked to the walls are growing in unison and feel like theyre getting closer than would return to their normal position.

T + :50 - The pace of the trip is picking up. I insufflate 50 mg of the DPT in one line, planning to have the peak of the mushrooms and peak from the first wave of DPT coincide. I lay down on my bed to see how strongly Im effected. What was meant to be a 10-minute break between lines ended up lasting 20, because it was becoming increasingly difficult to perform physical action, like lifting my head off the pillow.

T + 1:10  I finish my DPT, taking the last 50mg up my nostril. I had prepared a bongload of some awesome herb I had saved for this experience  hash plant, before taking the line. Trying to examine the beautiful nugget before burning, my vision was a fuzzy pixilated mess it looked alive.

T + 1:20 - After exhaling my smoke, I found my chin at rest on top of my bong, and my ego completely destroyed. How long have I been sitting like this, man? I quickly found a place for the bong on the floor before I spilt the thing on my bed.  Making a trip to my bathroom- I take a moment to stare at the prints on my walls of many of Dalis works. The bizarre aspects were a bit frightening, but the tricks Dalis paintings were playing on my head were magnificent.

From this point I started practically nodding off- entering classic transcendental states of mind, out of body experiences. Finding myself crumpled up in strange positions in various parts of my room, on the floor, in my bed, or slumped in a chair. Time had become so dilated it reminded me of inhaling nitrous on psychedelics or a 5-meo-dmt flash. Spectrums of color filled my vision. I encountered a concentration of female voices murmuring, I couldnt say exactly what their words were, but they seemed quite real and arrested my full attention.

T + 2:40  Nearing the end of my DPT plateau, I pack a pipe of my nugget. After taking a few lungfills I gazed out my window to witness some of the most impressive open eye visuals I have ever seen. I saw a virtual reconstruction of the entire landscape. Nothing was solid  everything was melting, electric with energy. It was near sensory overload. Realizing I had let my smoke linger in the room, and noticing I didnt stuff my door, I entered a paranoid phase of scent spraying and conspiracy forming for about 15 minutes, that I can look back and laugh about. I wrote no ones looking thru this onto me to help my self out of my delusions.

T + 3:35  Still finding myself drifting down the rabbithole for minutes at a time, I was seriously impressed with the experience this combination had produced. I had only smoked a half-gram of my pot at most, and the few hits had launched me into outerspace completely. I was actually disappointed I hadnt been able to pack up more herb during the trip. I was fairly drained from the intensity of my experience. I laid down receiving exquisite pleasure from the warmth and softness of bed, until finding sleep at about 7:00 AM (T + 5:00).

This combination was mind-blowing. It left me satisfied, and I wont need to trip again at this level for a couple months. I had considered an LSD / DPT combination. I find acid causes the out of body effect to an even greater extent than mushrooms  so I could imagine nodding off for even longer periods of time, possibly with more intensity, if I had tried those 2. I would jump at the chance to smoke DPT freebase.</bodytext></report>
